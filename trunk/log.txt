(Thu Feb 14 21:07:49 CET 2008)<dabreegster>it'd work more easily for text adventures. you go north in a room with no north exit and get the option to make a new room

(Thu Feb 14 21:08:18 CET 2008)<dabreegster>you slap a switch and get the option to code in a natural languageish script a reaction
(Thu Feb 14 21:08:30 CET 2008)<dabreegster>a roguelike might be tougher
(Thu Feb 14 21:08:49 CET 2008)<joe6pack>i think if someone wants to make their own game they will
(Thu Feb 14 21:09:03 CET 2008)<joe6pack>that's not why they *play* a game
(Thu Feb 14 21:09:17 CET 2008)<dabreegster>my main project is actually an engine. yeah, i know all of the criticisms about making engines and not games.
(Thu Feb 14 21:09:35 CET 2008)<joe6pack>IF specific languages are already natural langugageish

(Thu Feb 14 21:09:54 CET 2008)<dabreegster>but once i get a few things going, I'm going to make a bunch of 7drls with interesting ideas and just not have to worry about dungeons, movement, interface, LOS, pathfinding, etc
(Thu Feb 14 21:10:03 CET 2008)<joe6pack>it's a hobby, not a job 
(Thu Feb 14 21:10:07 CET 2008)<dabreegster>right
(Thu Feb 14 21:11:55 CET 2008)<joe6pack>dungeons, movement, interface, LOS,  pathfinding, etc -> a game ;)

(Thu Feb 14 21:16:04 CET 2008)<dabreegster>but making monsters with interesting attacks and keeping everything balanced so its not too easy but not impossible
(Thu Feb 14 21:16:10 CET 2008)<joe6pack>meh, "content".
(Thu Feb 14 21:16:33 CET 2008)<dabreegster>that gives me trouble. i want to encapsulate all the other stuff so i can really focus on getting the game to be "fun"
(Thu Feb 14 21:18:47 CET 2008)<dabreegster>my favorite rl to play is crawl because its so perfectly balanced. every game is difficult for a different reason
(Thu Feb 14 21:18:56 CET 2008)<joe6pack>mine as well 
(Thu Feb 14 21:19:15 CET 2008)<joe6pack>i managed to get a bit better at it today
(Thu Feb 14 21:19:27 CET 2008)<dabreegster>but martin's dungeon bash is another fun one, even though its much less complex. just because of the balance
(Thu Feb 14 21:19:42 CET 2008)<dabreegster>i've been playing it for four years and i'm still a noob
(Thu Feb 14 21:19:48 CET 2008)<joe6pack>haven't tried that one yet

(Thu Feb 14 21:20:52 CET 2008)<dabreegster>thats not bad at all
(Thu Feb 14 21:20:57 CET 2008)<dabreegster>what kinda combos do you play?
(Thu Feb 14 21:21:06 CET 2008)<joe6pack>human assassin 
(Thu Feb 14 21:21:16 CET 2008)<dabreegster>my faves are Deep elf fire/earthers, spriggan assassin (amazing class), and troll fighters
(Thu Feb 14 21:21:23 CET 2008)<joe6pack>before that i've tried tanger and monk
(Thu Feb 14 21:21:25 CET 2008)<dabreegster>if you like assassins, definitely try spriggans
(Thu Feb 14 21:21:33 CET 2008)<dabreegster>i like playing humans just to level up quickly
(Thu Feb 14 21:21:53 CET 2008)<joe6pack>what do spriggans do again?
(Thu Feb 14 21:22:14 CET 2008)<dabreegster>its just a race. they do a bunch of classes/roles
(Thu Feb 14 21:22:23 CET 2008)<joe6pack>yes but what are they about
(Thu Feb 14 21:22:30 CET 2008)<dabreegster>they move fast, pretty weak AC and HP wise, but they kick ass at stealth and stabbing and stuff
(Thu Feb 14 21:22:31 CET 2008)<joe6pack>are they the fairies?
(Thu Feb 14 21:22:49 CET 2008)<joe6pack>that's what i thought 
(Thu Feb 14 21:22:50 CET 2008)<dabreegster>the docs describe em as small elf-likes
(Thu Feb 14 21:23:11 CET 2008)<dabreegster>few things can stand a spriggan with a quick blade and high stealth
(Thu Feb 14 21:23:19 CET 2008)<dabreegster>you never have fights. just ambushes
(Thu Feb 14 21:23:25 CET 2008)<dabreegster>and when you do fight, you can run REALLY fast.
(Thu Feb 14 21:23:41 CET 2008)<joe6pack>i'll give it a try 
(Thu Feb 14 21:24:01 CET 2008)<joe6pack>shouldn't kobolds be good as assassins as well?
(Thu Feb 14 21:24:09 CET 2008)<dabreegster>dunno. i dont think ive ever played a kobold
(Thu Feb 14 21:24:29 CET 2008)<joe6pack>what *are* kobold supposidly good at anyway?
(Thu Feb 14 21:24:35 CET 2008)<joe6pack>seem pretty weak
(Thu Feb 14 21:24:38 CET 2008)<dabreegster>when i started crawl i would play naga venom mages. which was great to start with, but if you only focus on poison magic, youd be owned by dlvl 7 or so since more stuff resists poison
(Thu Feb 14 21:24:54 CET 2008)<dabreegster>hrmm
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:06 CET 2008)<dabreegster>they seem useless except for the fact that they gain experience as fast as humans
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:18 CET 2008)<dabreegster>which is really awesome once you're level 10 and need thousands exp to advance
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:41 CET 2008)<dabreegster>and while humans have average aptitude at all skills, kobolds are better at some magicks
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:42 CET 2008)<joe6pack>but don't they have more disadvantages relative to humans? 
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:48 CET 2008)<joe6pack>oh yea
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:49 CET 2008)<dabreegster>you're playing the latest stone soup, right?
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:52 CET 2008)<joe6pack>yes
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:53 CET 2008)<dabreegster>i guess their only advantage is the magic

(Thu Feb 14 21:55:59 CET 2008)<joe6pack>why not?
(Thu Feb 14 21:56:07 CET 2008)<RotateMe>you tell me :D
(Thu Feb 14 21:56:23 CET 2008)<joe6pack>it probably doesn't get it in onMessage
(Thu Feb 14 21:56:30 CET 2008)<RotateMe>that's why it would be better to add the logging to the sendMessage() method than having to log it manually everytime he sends something
(Thu Feb 14 21:56:44 CET 2008)<RotateMe>yeah maybe IRC works that way
(Thu Feb 14 21:56:51 CET 2008)<joe6pack>yes

(Thu Feb 14 21:57:03 CET 2008)<RotateMe>I always wondered why there isn't the slightest delay when sending messages
(Thu Feb 14 21:57:10 CET 2008)<RotateMe>no matter what connection you have
(Thu Feb 14 21:57:45 CET 2008)<RotateMe>probably it just adds your stuff to your own log and ignores messages from you

(Thu Feb 14 21:58:15 CET 2008)<joe6pack>RotateMe: it's not a proprety of irc in general, just of pircbot
(Thu Feb 14 21:58:27 CET 2008)<joe6pack>anyway, 
(Thu Feb 14 21:58:31 CET 2008)<joe6pack>to answer your question
(Thu Feb 14 21:58:41 CET 2008)<joe6pack>just overload sendMessage
(Thu Feb 14 21:59:25 CET 2008)<joe6pack>oh wait you can't
(Thu Feb 14 21:59:27 CET 2008)<joe6pack>it's final
(Thu Feb 14 21:59:36 CET 2008)<joe6pack>just declare another function then
(Thu Feb 14 22:00:07 CET 2008)<joe6pack>poublic void writeMessage(..){
(Thu Feb 14 22:00:24 CET 2008)<joe6pack>youstuff(); sendMessage(..);}
(Thu Feb 14 22:00:49 CET 2008)<joe6pack>and use that function everywhere you hav eused sendMessage
(Thu Feb 14 22:01:06 CET 2008)<joe6pack>instead of directly using sendMessage
(Thu Feb 14 22:01:10 CET 2008)<RotateMe>yeah, i thought of something like overload, but if that's not possible than this way is the obious way to go i guess
(Thu Feb 14 22:06:01 CET 2008)<RotateMe>k I commented the sources in joe6bot.java a bit and added a TODO and a IDEAS list (in form of comments)
(Thu Feb 14 22:06:41 CET 2008)<RotateMe>think that's it for today... my problem is that I can't leave my computer running :(
(Thu Feb 14 22:06:52 CET 2008)<RotateMe>it's hot and loud and in my room
(Thu Feb 14 22:07:33 CET 2008)<RotateMe>can you set up a permanent server if the bot is ready enough
(Thu Feb 14 22:07:38 CET 2008)<RotateMe>+?

(06:05:07)<konijn_nyt>ew
(06:05:10)<konijn_nyt>no
(06:05:13)<konijn_nyt>just no
(06:05:29)<konijn_nyt>text based is too hard to follow multiple channels on multiple servers
(06:05:49)<DaEezT>does icechat read out the words?
(06:06:02)<DaEezT>iirc all irc is text based :p
(06:06:45)<konijn_nyt>sure
(06:06:50)<konijn_nyt>it also reads my mind
(06:06:56)<konijn_nyt>filters are dirty content

(06:39:09)<joe6pack>on google code
(06:39:15)<deveah>link please
(06:39:28)<joe6pack>to the windows bin?
(06:39:40)<deveah>yes please
(06:40:12)<joe6pack>http://cryptrover.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cr.exe
(06:40:27)<deveah>thanks
(06:40:28)<joe6pack>haven't changed it much recenly, though 
(06:40:32)<joe6pack>np
(06:44:06)<joe6pack>these are rediculessly expensive aroung here 
(06:44:34)<joe6pack>like 3 or 4 euros 
(06:47:56)<joe6pack>deveah: should i go see "4 luni, 3 saptam√¢ni si 2 zile"?
(06:48:01)<deveah>yes
(06:48:12)<deveah>never seen it
(06:48:17)<deveah>but i heard it's great
(06:48:23)<joe6pack>hrm
(06:48:30)<joe6pack>oh damn
(06:48:45)<deveah>it's all about the bad things of my country
(06:48:45)<joe6pack>started 18 mins ago
(06:49:13)<joe6pack>so it's about everything in romania, then?
(06:49:30)<deveah>not everything
(06:49:40)<joe6pack>maybe another day. it only plays in one cinema and it started in 18:30
(06:49:42)<joe6pack>yea i know
(06:49:49)<joe6pack>just joking 
(06:50:07)<deveah>it's about a woman who wants to abort
(06:50:10)<joe6pack>my father is Moldavian, which is even more fucked up than being romanian 
(06:50:10)<deveah>i think
(06:50:33)<deveah>really? moldovians are romanian's brothers!
(06:50:57)<deveah>y'know, Moldova belonged to Romania in the first place
(06:51:00)<jomiolto>googled for the english name of the movie and got: "4 months 3 weeks 2 days = 144.7474 days" :)
(06:51:14)<joe6pack>:|
(06:51:27)<joe6pack>i don't think the moldavians would like that definition 
(06:51:39)<joe6pack>both were part of the ottoman empire 
(06:51:51)<joe6pack>iirc
(06:51:57)<konijn_nyt>hmmm
(06:52:09)<konijn_nyt>I paid 14 dollars for 2 sandwhiches :\
(06:52:33)<joe6pack>yes but these says 14 usd is 80 euro cents
(06:52:37)<konijn_nyt>of course, at the Times Square, everything is expensive
(06:52:39)<joe6pack>or so
(06:53:13)<joe6pack>4.8 euro - so it's about the same price i guess
(06:53:20)<joe6pack>even a bit more expensive 
(06:53:33)<konijn_nyt>yeah
(06:53:42)<konijn_nyt>oh well
(06:53:50)<deveah>joe6pack - what's your family name?
(06:53:53)<konijn_nyt>I make more money then when I was in Europe as well
(06:53:53)<joe6pack>i didn't remember subway being expensive when i was in the us
(06:54:01)<konijn_nyt>oh
(06:54:07)<konijn_nyt>relatively it is not expensive
(06:54:14)<joe6pack>deveah: my grandfather changed it in the 30's when he left Moldova 
(06:54:17)<konijn_nyt>every other option is even more expensive ;\
(06:54:33)<deveah>oh, then what was his name then? and now?
(06:55:04)<joe6pack>schuchmann
(06:55:09)<joe6pack>and today yehieli
(06:55:20)<deveah>oh
(06:56:01)<deveah>usually romanian/moldovian names end with -escu (40%)
(06:56:10)<deveah>like Popescu, Ionescu etc
(06:56:25)<joe6pack>i'm Jewish though 
(06:56:40)<konijn_nyt>huh
(06:57:11)<deveah>weird
(06:57:26)<konijn_nyt>yehieli seems to be a more judaic
(06:57:29)<konijn_nyt>name
(06:57:39)<joe6pack>konijn_nyt: yea, it's in hebrew
(06:57:50)<deveah>o.0 you've got me
(06:58:04)<konijn_nyt>things I read when researching Hellband ;]
(06:58:08)<joe6pack>why's that?
(06:58:16)<konijn_meeting>brb
(06:58:24)<joe6pack>have fun in your meeting 
(07:01:11)<joe6pack>i think i'll go watch this film:
(07:01:12)<joe6pack>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/
(07:01:22)<joe6pack>or one of these:
(07:01:24)<joe6pack>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472062/
(07:01:30)<joe6pack>http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0765120/
(07:02:18)<RotateMe>:O
(07:02:30)<RotateMe>rating for there will be blood is pretty damn good for imdb
(07:02:36)<joe6pack>yea
(07:02:47)<joe6pack>i think i'll go watch it
(07:03:06)<joe6pack>imdb is pretty reliable 
(07:03:09)<RotateMe>okay not the blueberry one
(07:03:12)<RotateMe>so:
(07:03:19)<RotateMe>decide blood,war
(07:03:19)<joe6bot> blood
(07:03:27)<RotateMe>have fun :D
(07:03:36)<joe6pack>that settles it then
(07:04:04)<RotateMe>recently watched "no land for old men" and "rise of the footsoldier"
(07:04:19)<joe6pack>excellent! it even plays in the cinema that's close to my place
(07:04:20)<RotateMe>liked both of them very much but i think they aren't on anymore, are they?
(07:04:41)<joe6pack>i wanted to see no loand for old man
(07:04:41)<RotateMe>yeah I think my sourcecode took that into account :D
(07:04:54)<joe6pack>but i was too late
(07:05:07)<RotateMe>pretty good movie... was hard for me to understand tomy lee jones... his accent is beond texan
(07:05:32)<joe6pack>i've also like 3:10 to yuma, which was the last film i've seen
(07:05:42)<joe6pack>pretty good, that one
(07:06:08)<joe6pack>oh wait
(07:06:09)<joe6pack>no
(07:06:11)<joe6pack>Into The Wild
(07:06:15)<joe6pack>that was the last one
(07:06:22)<joe6pack>3:10 was the one before that 
(07:06:35)<joe6pack>(both were good)
(07:07:27)<purestrain>arrr
(07:07:43)<RotateMe>hmmm 3:10 looks good
(07:07:47)<RotateMe>put it on my list
(07:29:38)<RotateMe>probably the worst decision in an early stage of DungeonHunter was to limit the maps to 50x25 ...
(07:29:58)<RotateMe>it's pretty hard to generate useful maps on such a small space
(07:46:36)<RotateMe>what do you think: http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/Screens/screenshot2.jpg (small rooms)
(07:46:42)<RotateMe>http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/Screens/screenshot3.jpg (midsized)

(07:57:46)<konijn_meeting>no
(07:57:49)<konijn_meeting>just no
(08:13:14)<purestrain>i feel that i should really try ubuntu again
(08:14:05)<purestrain>my thoughts are chaotic... on one side i want linux back, on the other is my windows system running and stable
(08:19:29)<RotateMe_walkin>k I'm leaving but i think i will leave the bot running tonight
(08:39:32)<deveah>joe6pack, jo6bot should have ops - you might want to give him serious tasks like kicking other bots or auto-voicing active users...
(08:39:42)<deveah>like TMAnna on EsperNet
(08:39:48)<konijn_nyt>hey hey
(08:39:53)<konijn_nyt>no kicking other bots !
(08:39:53)<deveah>Boten Anna :P
(08:40:02)<deveah>yes kicking other bots
(08:40:13)<konijn_nyt>fine, rogue bots he can kick
(08:40:16)<konijn_nyt>but no member bots 
(08:40:19)<deveah>especially the ad/porn ones
(08:40:23)<konijn_nyt>ew
(08:40:26)<konijn_nyt>yes
(08:40:44)<deveah>and especially NO cheap viagra ads
(08:43:26)<deveah>why is there silence?
(08:43:36)<konijn_nyt>?
(08:43:39)<konijn_nyt>I fully agreed
(08:43:44)<deveah>ok
(08:43:49)<deveah>joe6pack!
(08:43:52)<konijn_nyt>we only want expensive viagra ads ;\
(08:44:10)<deveah>ok, both then
(08:47:05)<deveah>it'd be cool "rogue of the day" in the topic too
(08:47:18)<deveah>fridge1drl first.
(08:50:38)<deveah>cya tomorrow; my current schecule sucks bigtime
(08:50:48)<deveah>no time for roguelikes *now*

(01:37:46)<RotateMe>:(
(01:38:11)<joe6pack>you should always fix bugs before adding features 
(01:39:01)<RotateMe>well feature in the sense of something that's missing that should already be there
(01:39:08)<joe6pack>like?
(01:39:13)<RotateMe>no core stuff
(01:39:19)<joe6pack>like?
(01:39:30)<RotateMe>;Smaller reqs:
(01:39:30)<RotateMe>;ooooooooooooo
(01:39:30)<RotateMe>;- add displayfloormessage to the options variables
(01:39:30)<RotateMe>;- better durability system
(01:39:30)<RotateMe>;- defense is to high and hit% to low (both in the beginning)
(01:39:31)<RotateMe>;- screammessages should be optional
(01:39:33)<RotateMe>;- bolts to target
(01:39:45)<RotateMe>these are the first 5 of about 40 or 50
(01:39:51)<joe6pack>i see
(01:40:03)<RotateMe>and bugs look like this
(01:40:03)<RotateMe>;=> BUGS:
(01:40:04)<RotateMe>;   skills may go through walls (if the first field is a wall)

(01:40:05)<RotateMe>;   check wether dungeon repopulation will be reseted when entering a new dungeon (?)
(01:40:27)<joe6pack>i never bother writing so much... i just write the first 3-4 bugs, fix those, and go on
(01:40:28)<RotateMe>you could take some reqs to the bugs section and vice versa but bugs are usually more nasty
(01:41:29)<RotateMe>well i usually add some content, play for about half an hour and note all bugs i encounter
(01:41:56)<joe6pack>oh i tought you were talking about the bot :O
(01:41:59)<RotateMe>the bug section isn't that big
(01:42:01)<RotateMe>:D
(01:42:14)<joe6pack>wondered how you've managed to write so much about it 
(01:42:26)<RotateMe>heh
(01:43:05)<RotateMe>;- defense is to high and hit% to low (both in the beginning)
(01:43:17)<RotateMe>that's a bot req :D
(01:45:53)<deveah_ubuntu>i ate bit.
(01:47:19)<deveah_ubuntu>joe6pack - what cat dir?
(01:47:50)<joe6pack>deveah_ubuntu: what what what?
(01:48:13)<joe6pack>cat /etc/apt/sources.list
(01:48:13)<deveah_ubuntu>the eta thing you mentioned

(01:49:46)<joe6pack>i highly doubt that's the answer that line gave you
(01:49:59)<deveah_ubuntu>what did you ask?
(01:50:11)<joe6pack>paste the answer to cat /etc/apt/sources.list

(01:53:29)<jomiolto>hmm, last night I had an idea on how to make "ray-casting with bresenham" los more "permissive", but now I seem to have forgotten it
(01:53:52)<joe6pack>deveah_ubuntu: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
(01:54:20)<jomiolto>btw, you can also use Synaptic to add stuff to repositories
(01:54:22)<deveah_ubuntu>i got it in gedit

(01:54:37)<deveah_ubuntu>same thing

(01:54:54)<deveah_ubuntu>how?
(01:55:01)<deveah_ubuntu>like deleting the lines?
(01:55:07)<joe6pack>delete only the #

(03:50:33)<joe6pack>is that yours?
(04:17:02)<RotateMe>nono
(04:17:12)<RotateMe>just found that
(04:18:15)<RotateMe>but it's uncompiled and i think in python so i won't try it, you know how lazy i am
(04:27:57)<joe6pack>there are compiled files in there
(04:28:13)<joe6pack>.pyc files are compiled 
(04:29:28)<RotateMe>ah so python too is one of those languages you need stuff for :(
(04:31:39)<joe6pack>like java
(04:32:37)<joe6pack>but it's normally more straight forward to run, what with java's classpath shenanigans and what have yous 
(04:32:58)<RotateMe>yeah, that sucks most
(04:33:25)<RotateMe>well in windows you can always put some .bat files along with the stuff you've made
(04:33:41)<joe6pack>with python it's normally just "python blabla.pyc"
(04:34:13)<joe6pack>in *nix that would be a shell script
(04:35:57)<joe6pack>mmm... these hazelnut waffles are delicious 
(04:36:20)<RotateMe>do you guys know dÔøΩner?
(04:36:27)<RotateMe>(doener)
(04:36:39)<joe6pack>the kebab?
(04:37:04)<RotateMe>yes
(04:37:15)<joe6pack>it's all over the place in vienna
(04:37:19)<RotateMe>it's awesome when eaten after 3 am
(04:37:33)<joe6pack>actually everywhere in germany & austria 
(04:38:13)<RotateMe>yeah i'm from germany but it's rare to find openened kebabs after 3am :D
(04:38:27)<joe6pack>i very rarely eat meat, and never had doener kebab
(04:38:41)<RotateMe>O:
(04:38:48)<joe6pack>but i've had shawarma 
(04:39:05)<RotateMe>ah that's great too
(04:39:06)<joe6pack>which is the arab version of the same sandwich 
(04:40:00)<RotateMe>i had some real strange tasting vegetables in there
(04:40:04)<RotateMe>kind of sour
(04:40:16)<RotateMe>couldn't really define what it was by looks and taste
(04:40:29)<joe6pack>which color?
(04:41:16)<RotateMe>dark yellowish cut in squares with about 2cm each
(04:41:21)<joe6pack>probably some sort of pickles 
(04:41:32)<joe6pack>maybe pickled pepers
(04:41:34)<RotateMe>yeah i thought that too
(05:07:58)<joe6pack>hey there eyenot
(05:12:24)<eyenot>hey j6p
(05:12:41)<eyenot>took a break from working on guts to get input/output done yesterday. 
(05:13:33)<eyenot>after a few added/removed missing/stray brackets, updating some renamed-function calls, and adding an argument in 16 incidences of an effects-check i forgot requires a floornumber argument...
(05:13:56)<eyenot>all like 3800 lines of so-far guts compiled fine, however, when i tried to dive into keypress catching i hit bottom
(05:15:11)<eyenot>i still have to smash together the various routines for segment generation based on the preordained rules i set down, and finish a few more tiers of artistic vision and challenge
(05:15:19)<eyenot>but other than that it's almost ready to go
(05:15:58)<eyenot>i came up with my missing impelment for the 3rd 1/4 of the game the other day and it will basically require an additional variable
(05:16:22)<eyenot>so today i sit down and work on a keypress parser seperate from the rest of the code. how are you?
(05:16:24)<RotateMe>eyenot, what are you working on?
(05:17:02)<eyenot>it was originally for the 7drl but it got too big of a gut and didn't even have a face, so now it's looking like a 30drl
(05:17:55)<RotateMe>does it have a name already?
(05:18:12)<RotateMe>or a special concept?
(05:20:12)<eyenot>i'm going to leave the name-dross, story, etc. for last. there's not really a special concept except that it's supposed to make up to me some things that bother me about rl's
(05:20:23)<eyenot>it's just a general-purpose dungeon
(05:21:12)<eyenot>i don't think many people will be very impressed with it, but i can almost gaurantee i'll play it a lot
(05:23:22)<RotateMe>yeah that's nice... i made RogueTower that way and it worked because i played it quite a lot
(05:23:57)<RotateMe>goddammit, fixed two bugs today and found two more :(
(05:24:32)<RotateMe>and one of those seems to be pretty big
(05:24:39)<eyenot>does roguetower have a page?
(05:24:49)<RotateMe>a RogueBasin entry
(05:25:02)<RotateMe>http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=RogueTower
(05:25:11)<RotateMe>win only, i hope that's fine

(05:26:46)<RotateMe>hah :D
(05:26:55)<eyenot>it looks interesting
(05:28:46)<RotateMe>well it's nothing revolutionary and it has no fov and random dungeons, i think i only had 1 free day during the 7 days
(05:28:56)<RotateMe>or better 8 days
(05:31:27)<eyenot>hmm
(05:39:08)<eyenot>i'm having trouble with getchar, considering it requires enter to parse
(05:39:18)<eyenot>i need something more instantaneous without resorting to ncurses 
(05:39:58)<eyenot>there just aren't many tutorials about input/output over terminals that don't rely on curses or ncurses
(06:01:59)<RotateMe>i can't really help you with your problem, but why don't you take a look at the ncurses sources and do it like they did it?
(06:02:49)<eyenot>i'll be fine
(06:03:06)<eyenot>i'm just going to have to use an int and a loop
(06:03:11)<eyenot>just being sluggish
(06:07:41)<joe6pack>eyenot: i'm fine thanks. why don't you want to rely on curses?
(06:07:50)<joe6pack>pdcurses has a windows pot 
(06:08:05)<eyenot>man...
(06:08:15)<eyenot>i don't want to rely on curses. :)
(06:08:19)<joe6pack>ok :)
(06:08:35)<eyenot>and i'm trying to ensure everything works over screen/tty
(06:08:46)<eyenot>i'm assuming ansi terminal
(06:08:52)<joe6pack>but it will be a major pain to make your game behave the same way cross platform without it 
(06:09:18)<eyenot>well it's ansi-c and i'm assuming ansi terminal, that sorts of meets the mark for standard for me
(06:09:30)<joe6pack>terminal emulators are nutoriously non-standard conforming 
(06:09:42)<eyenot>ansi's been around for too long for me to worry about it
(06:10:35)<joe6pack>have it your way. but i assure you your game will not work the same way on windows/mac os x/linux the same way out of the box
(06:10:37)<eyenot>if it doesn't emulate color it'll still receive characters. most keypresses are sent the same way
(06:11:14)<eyenot>i'm not too worried about it not working -in- windows, but if it were compiled as a dos application it would work fine 
(06:11:25)<eyenot>it's going to be source so what's the worry
(06:11:29)<eyenot>???
(06:11:37)<joe6pack>no worries :)
(06:11:47)<eyenot>did you think i was going to release a binary ?
(06:12:56)<joe6pack>i think you will spend a lot of time solving a problem solved many times before; i.e the incompatible way different operation systems and terminals handle keyboard input
(06:13:16)<eyenot>hmm
(06:13:21)<joe6pack>but i am looking forward to being pleasantly surprised 
(06:13:39)<eyenot>i see your point
(06:14:13)<eyenot>i will just let everybody know that when tested it worked in a standard vt100/ansi terminal in a linux screen session and that the code is ansi-c
(06:14:45)<joe6pack>okay 
(06:14:56)<eyenot>that input and output worked fine in puTTY and window's built-in telnet
(06:15:11)<eyenot>and as long as the user can set up a shell somewhere with GCC permission, they'll be able to play
(06:15:26)<eyenot>i really don't feel like setting up allllll the cases for everything else under the sun
(06:15:41)<eyenot>i think i'll just steal something out of nethack
(06:15:47)<joe6pack>:o
(06:15:50)<joe6pack>hah
(06:16:15)<eyenot>oh and the windows users will be able to play if they compile it as a dos application and have ansi emulation working
(06:16:21)<eyenot>so hey, both worlds
(06:16:59)<joe6pack>nethack keyboard handling -> danger will robinson!
(06:17:55)<joe6pack>that is a lot of fairly hairy code 
(06:18:22)<joe6pack>btw did you say you've written 3800 loc of c code?
(06:18:47)<eyenot>let me check
(06:19:00)<eyenot>3881
(06:19:09)<eyenot>i think it will be around 4500 w/o io
(06:19:13)<joe6pack>that's quite a lot!
(06:19:20)<eyenot>it's taken me two weeks
(06:19:32)<eyenot>err. almost two weeks... 10 days?
(06:19:37)<joe6pack>iirc the 7drl version of cryptrover was about 500 loc of c 
(06:19:54)<eyenot>well, there are some really long and complicated routines. 
(06:20:05)<eyenot>like one to determine all the cases of behaviour for a certain bug
(06:20:18)<eyenot>depending on its location in a given quad of a dungeon floor
(06:20:25)<eyenot>*shrug* it all had to be in there
(06:20:42)<joe6pack>bug as in "a bug in your source" or "the bug bites you! you are poisoned"? 
(06:20:54)<eyenot>bug as in a bug in the dungeon
(06:20:59)<eyenot>a firebug
(06:21:13)<eyenot>firebugs_routine lines 1128-1275
(06:21:23)<eyenot>head hurts, bbl

(08:04:21)<jomiolto>two hours into developing my 7drl and I've already found several bugs in my roguelike library :)
(08:09:57)<joe6pack>:)
(08:10:05)<joe6pack>you will probably find many more 
(08:12:57)<jomiolto>yeah, quite likely as I hacked the library together quite fast, wanting to get to 7drl development
(08:13:20)<joe6pack>i usually go the other way around
(08:13:24)<joe6pack>start coding the game
(08:13:43)<joe6pack>and afterwards extracts a "framework" from it
(08:16:40)<joe6pack>aka the Craptaculus Framework
(08:18:00)<purestrain>its the better method usually
(08:18:05)<eyenot>i will probably optimize my game before release with some kind of reusable frame
(08:18:16)<eyenot>it might even make the game better to have some things reusable
(08:18:44)<joe6pack>eyenot: will probably make your code better, i don't see how it should affect the game itself 
(08:19:02)<purestrain>i'm switching from C++ to D now; have to start from scratch again
(08:19:08)<joe6pack>:O
(08:19:14)<joe6pack>stop it
(08:19:26)<purestrain>too late; i felt in love with D
(08:19:48)<purestrain>and i hate these slow recompilations of about 1 minute just for adding documentation in any header file
(08:19:57)<joe6pack>YOU THERE! HALT! 
(08:20:03)<eyenot>i'm fighting for an ansi-c alternative to ncurses
(08:20:27)<eyenot>i was having better luck googling for help the other day
(08:20:27)<joe6pack>YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR THE CRIME OF SOFTWARE MASTURBATION 
(08:20:34)<purestrain>=D
(08:21:11)<joe6pack>eyenot: pdcurses is probably more modern/portable than ncurses
(08:21:16)<joe6pack>is it not ansi c?
(08:21:32)<eyenot>i hadn't heard it mentioned once yet in all this tutorial crawling
(08:21:42)<joe6pack>well you do now ;)
(08:21:46)<joe6pack>the magic of irc 
(08:21:53)<eyenot>i was just sitting down and working with read function from stdin to make my own keypress acknowledgement
(08:22:03)<joe6pack>so you've said 
(08:22:09)<eyenot>good point
(08:22:51)<eyenot>i tried to use ansi codes to get a noecho to work, but my terminal ignored it or something
(08:23:19)<joe6pack>purestrain: i suggest you dave yourself another 3-4 language changes and just program it in lisp already 
(08:23:32)<joe6pack>eyenot: what a surprise 
(08:23:39)<purestrain>next year perhaps
(08:26:03)<purestrain>but i consider lisp to slow for my target machine
(08:26:16)<joe6pack>that depends on the lisp
(08:26:30)<joe6pack>some implementation are as fast as c++
(08:26:41)<purestrain>nice
(08:27:03)<joe6pack>but probably still guzzle up more memory 
(08:27:10)<joe6pack>but that might not be an issue 
(08:27:20)<purestrain>i've got 64mb of memory available
(08:27:29)<purestrain>well.. i think ~50mb
(08:28:00)<joe6pack>well if your program would take up 400Kb in ran instead of 200Kb, that wouldn't make a difference 
(08:28:09)<joe6pack>s/ran/RAM
(08:28:38)<joe6pack>are you aiming for some handheld platform? 
(08:29:00)<purestrain>yes, gp2x
(08:29:15)<joe6pack>that Korean one?
(08:29:19)<purestrain>yes
(08:29:26)<joe6pack>i have never seen one in the wild
(08:29:52)<joe6pack>do someone actually own one of these things? 
(08:30:00)<purestrain>two are in front of me :-)
(08:30:21)<joe6pack>how many people do you know that have one or more?
(08:30:59)<purestrain>personal only one, but the community is steady growing
(08:33:18)<purestrain>but to be honest: i don't think i will never get a proper D compiler for arm running
(08:35:42)<eyenot>purestrain is that that all-purpose handheld/cellphone
(08:35:59)<joe6pack>some gaming handheld 
(08:36:01)<eyenot>a friend of mine was bragging about a cellphone/computer toy he had ordered from japan or somewhere
(08:36:20)<eyenot>how it could be configured to work with any existing network
(08:36:27)<eyenot>oh
(08:37:26)<eyenot>he was working out a cellphone network pyramid, and needed one of these devices to be the maintainer. he said in japan it's more expected to have a device that works for various networks unlike in america
(08:38:45)<joe6pack>eyenot: where do you sleep, if i may ask?
(08:40:12)<eyenot>lately i have sort of a hole in the ground somewhere 
(08:40:33)<joe6pack>and that works out?
(08:40:36)<joe6pack>in winter?
(08:40:41)<eyenot>i've found that this read from stdin doesn't echo if the terminal is busy displaying something else
(08:40:48)<eyenot>i've been out there all winter so far
(08:40:55)<joe6pack>damn
(08:41:07)<eyenot>last year or the year before i couldn't have done it. i had to prepare
(08:41:15)<joe6pack>i can't even stay outside for an hour in this weather 
(08:41:48)<eyenot>you don't acclimate?
(08:42:34)<eyenot>... the problem is if i'm running the read-in as a loop i have to set a delay that waits for the stdin to have a character length
(08:42:49)<joe6pack>i will probably get Pneumonia pretty quickly   
(08:43:04)<eyenot>this is hideous. i really don't want to include anything besides stdio.h
(08:43:12)<eyenot>i hate ncurses, it's old, clunky, and stupid
(08:43:26)<eyenot>i'd like to just grab getch from ncurses and keep that
(08:43:39)<eyenot>getchar is making me tear my hair out, it always waits for an enter key
(08:43:40)<joe6pack>pdcurses is new, and marginally less  clunky, and stupid ;)
(08:43:57)<eyenot>i might try pdcurses, just that it presents itself *as* ncurses on their page
(08:44:06)<joe6pack>what?
(08:44:18)<joe6pack>http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/
(08:44:25)<eyenot>err... it presents itself as 'curses'
(08:44:27)<eyenot>http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/doc/PDCurses.txt
(08:44:28)<joe6pack>where does it say it's ncurses
(08:44:34)<eyenot>sorry, mismemory
(08:44:58)<eyenot>i just want one single thing, a keypress reader that reacts once a key is pressed
(08:45:16)<joe6pack>i understand 
(08:45:27)<joe6pack>but i don't know of an easier way to get that 
(08:45:39)<joe6pack>other than to use some form of curses
(08:46:18)<eyenot>i could look at their source
(08:46:55)<joe6pack>i don't think the standard defines a way to get a char like you want to
(08:47:20)<joe6pack>so you will have to handle platfomr dependent crap *somewhere*
(08:47:40)<joe6pack>whether manually or using a library 
(08:48:32)<eyenot>hmm
(08:48:53)<joe6pack>ANSI/ISO C says nothing about it, so how can stdio implement it 
(08:49:06)<eyenot>well i can just read from the stdio
(08:49:08)<eyenot>err the stdin
(08:49:24)<eyenot>and for the most part the keys create the same codes across platforms, terms, etc.
(08:49:45)<joe6pack>i hope you don't want to use the key pad
(08:49:58)<eyenot>i only expect a few things: dos/linux, ansi translation enabled, vt100 or ansi terminal, etc.
(08:50:08)<eyenot>these things are so standardized i don't think portability should matter 
(08:50:14)<eyenot>i don't want ot use the keypad
(08:51:23)<joe6pack>eyenot: yea, only such minor terminals as the gnome-terminal, the kde terminal, mac os x's Terminal.app and possibly windows' console don't strictly conform to the standard. but who uses those anyway?
(08:52:04)<eyenot>i see coming up with this function myself as a challenge
(08:52:06)<eyenot>http://cermics.enpc.fr/~ts/C/FUNCTIONS/getchar.html
(08:52:28)<eyenot>there are a lot of sob stories like this, somebody trying to implement a single-key reader but not being able to. i plan to deal with it in a file or stream approach
(08:52:28)<joe6pack>godspeed, grass hopper 
(08:52:52)<joe6pack>may the source be with you
(08:53:08)<eyenot>anybody who can use xterm can emulate an ansi terminal. anybody using windows can run a dos app. the exceptions are very few.
(08:53:19)<joe6pack>ok
(08:53:36)<eyenot>ah i forgot. i already had this whole conversation with rotate-me ... so this is all over again
(08:53:47)<eyenot>for a moment i was going to say 'hey, i already covered this when i first got in...'
(08:53:56)<joe6pack>i think you may have even had it with me as well 
(08:53:59)<eyenot>oh
(08:54:09)<eyenot>i just figure, i'm sticking with a few things that are implemented just about everywhere
(08:54:19)<eyenot>the last thing on my mind is worries over portability
(08:54:23)<joe6pack>no problem. good luck. 
(08:54:26)<eyenot>ty
(08:56:23)<joe6pack>http://c-faq.com/osdep/cbreak.html
(08:57:15)<eyenot>all i really have to do is find a simply written source to something like getchar and take out whatever is forcing it to wait for the newline
(08:57:42)<joe6pack>look at the link
(08:58:32)<joe6pack>about in the middle they start showing the source code
(09:00:47)<eyenot>damn. i'm preempted
(09:02:47)<eyenot>what sucks is if i try to do anything BUT this one little thing, i have no problems. as long as i'm willing to accept linebreak input.
(09:02:55)<eyenot>this is the only hurdle.
(09:03:39)<eyenot>so far the program will work wherever C compiles and there's a terminal or screen. as long as i don't expect single keypress input.
(09:03:45)<eyenot>gd it
(09:07:26)<eyenot>this is so stupid. *in the special case of stdin* ... all sorts of standard c functions have been told to wait for the enter key.
(09:07:39)<eyenot>so it can't be treated raw like a file or stream without that happening.
(09:31:36)<purestrain>D really kicks ass.... D2 will be superior
(09:37:25)<konijn_nyt>greetings and salutations
(09:38:20)<purestrain>Ave konijn_dinner. Morituri te salutant.
(09:38:31)<konijn_nyt>Topic is: The official rec.games.roguelike.development channel | link of the day: http://kuoi.com/~kamikaze/GameDesign/art07_rogue_dungeon.php | current bot developer: RotateMe
(09:38:43)<jomiolto>"Morituri" ?)
(09:39:07)<konijn_nyt>garbled 'to die' I assume
(09:39:15)<konijn_nyt>mourir
(09:40:07)<jomiolto>I think literal translation of "morituri" is something like "ones heading towards death". That's why the question
(09:40:29)<konijn_nyt>it's a reference to the gladiators and the Caesar I assume
(09:40:50)<jomiolto>uhm, yes, I know, but why use that greeting? :)
(09:40:51)<konijn_nyt>we who are about to die salute you
(09:40:55)<konijn_nyt>ah
(09:40:57)<purestrain>yes, i don't know the proper english term: perhaps something like "the dead consecrated greets you" ?
(09:41:00)<jomiolto>ah, that's a much better translation
(09:41:44)<purestrain>ah, now i know the proper translation in english :-)
(09:42:14)<konijn_nyt>we used to greet our teachers this way before tough exams ;)
(09:42:14)<jomiolto>"Those about to die salute you." is another translation (sounds better, imo)
(09:42:20)<jomiolto>:D
(09:42:44)<jomiolto>well, I'm currently on a 7drl quest, so I guess it applies to me too :)
(09:43:11)<jomiolto>the clock is ticking and I'm... on IRC
(09:43:16)<purestrain>hehe
(09:43:43)<purestrain>well; i think i cannot take part of the contest
(09:44:38)<purestrain>perhaps i should make my whole framework for everything as freely available ?
(09:45:06)<ido>sure
(09:45:08)<ido>why not
(09:45:56)<konijn_nyt>of course
(09:46:01)<konijn_nyt>the more frameworks the better
(09:46:13)<purestrain>well, its not a framework for roguelikes ;-)
(09:46:21)<ido>the more available code the better
(09:46:57)<ido>you never knows where someone might need exactly what you've got and will stumble upon your code through google
(09:54:04)<purestrain>http://retroforge.de/~md/ released
(09:54:13)<ido>\o/
(09:55:37)<ido>"Its not buildable because i have no makefiles ready." <-- than how did you build it?
(09:55:44)<purestrain>codeblocks
(09:56:07)<purestrain>i've deleted the codeblocks project files
(09:56:24)<ido>why?
(09:56:38)<ido>now we can't build it at all 
(09:57:23)<ido>eek
(09:57:29)<ido>that is a lot of code
(09:57:49)<konijn_nyt>hmmmm
(09:57:53)<konijn_nyt>too bad
(09:58:02)<konijn_nyt>you know that codeblocks can export a makefile right ?
(09:58:07)<purestrain>no
(09:58:12)<konijn_nyt>darned
(09:58:19)<konijn_nyt>well, you know for next time ;)
(09:58:38)<ido>you can still update the file on your blag 
(09:59:25)<ido>purestrain: how much of that 959kb of code is your code and how much are libs?
(09:59:30)<ido>like lua and stuff
(10:00:31)<purestrain>lua and xml in framework/src
(10:00:43)<ido>so other that it's all yours?
(10:00:52)<purestrain>i think so
(10:01:01)<purestrain>ah no
(10:01:12)<purestrain>include/core/sigslot.h
(10:03:16)<ido>so about 247.5kb is yours
(10:03:28)<purestrain>o_O i never wrote so much
(10:03:56)<ido>959-(65.5+ 436.1+109+101)
(10:04:09)<ido>actually 959.1-(65.5+ 436.1+109+101)
(10:04:14)<ido>=247.5kb
(10:04:20)<purestrain>oh
(10:05:03)<purestrain>yes, then it is so
(10:07:32)<konijn_nyt>oh man
(10:07:45)<konijn_nyt>seriously, people are just so lazy
(10:08:00)<konijn_nyt>  /* The current level number. */
(10:08:03)<konijn_nyt>  byte dl;
(10:09:21)<konijn_nyt>why not currentDungeonLevel ??
(10:09:34)<konijn_nyt>you would even save out a comment ;)
(10:09:42)<ido>that depends where that vart is
(10:10:01)<ido>i owuld call it "level"
(10:10:11)<purestrain>me to
(10:10:17)<konijn_nyt>level would hold the level no ?
(10:10:19)<purestrain>currentDungeonLevelWhereThePlayerIsIn
(10:10:22)<konijn_nyt>with all walls/doors/monsters
(10:10:35)<konijn_nyt>heh
(10:11:45)<konijn_nyt>yeah
(10:11:55)<konijn_nyt>Level is an ambigous word I guess
(10:12:08)<konijn_nyt>maybe currentDungeonDepth ;)
(10:12:56)<ido>why "current"
(10:13:12)<ido>"DungeonLevel", if you are so inclined 
(10:13:46)<konijn_nyt>ah
(10:13:55)<konijn_nyt>mayhaps I got blindsided by the comment
(10:14:06)<konijn_nyt>as we say at nyt, it is what it is ;)
(10:14:47)<ido>konijn_nyt: you may be a c programmer, but you have the heart of a cobol coder 
(10:18:12)<konijn_nyt>I am next gen COBOL coder
(10:18:15)<konijn_nyt>oh my god
(10:18:25)<konijn_nyt>are you saying it is bleeding into my other code ??
(10:18:29)<konijn_nyt>that is terrible
(10:18:50)<konijn_nyt>I do ABAP
(10:19:43)<ido>never had anything to do with ABAP
(10:19:47)<ido>had to google it
(10:19:52)<konijn_nyt>hehehe
(10:20:05)<konijn_nyt>the only thing good about it is that it guarantees good income for developers ;)
(10:20:29)<ido>like java then ;)
(10:20:52)<ido>at my last job i made maybe 50% more than the php programmers 
(10:21:02)<ido>only because i was doing java and they were doing php
(10:21:24)<ido>ok, maybe 30%
(10:21:39)<ido>but a lot mreo, at any rate
(10:22:08)<ido>(jesus christ that is some hardcore dyslexia)
(10:22:25)<ido>other than the 'm' not a single letter is where it should be
(10:23:07)<konijn_nyt>well, ABAP in general gets you 100% once you start to have like 5 years of exp
(10:23:14)<konijn_nyt>100% more that is
(10:23:21)<ido>:O
(10:23:23)<konijn_nyt>yeah
(10:23:25)<ido>than what?
(10:23:29)<konijn_nyt>than php
(10:23:44)<konijn_nyt>PHP employee would be about 70K
(10:23:45)<ido>yea php pays the worst 
(10:23:51)<konijn_nyt>ABAP would be about 140K
(10:24:18)<ido>well these are ny/cali rates 
(10:24:24)<konijn_nyt>indeed
(10:24:28)<konijn_nyt>I guess
(10:24:34)<konijn_nyt>although there is a limited amount of ABAPers
(10:25:05)<ido>in israel a nice java or c++ job would net you maybe 80k usd
(10:25:05)<konijn_nyt>I have friends in that state with horse carts and the black clothes
(10:25:17)<ido>if you have ~3 years expereince 
(10:25:23)<konijn_nyt>ah
(10:25:32)<konijn_nyt>hmmm
(10:25:35)<konijn_nyt>I would have given you more
(10:25:50)<ido>me personally?
(10:25:58)<konijn_nyt>ys
(10:26:18)<ido> 80k usd goes a long way in tel aviv 
(10:26:27)<ido>it is cheaper than nyc
(10:26:39)<konijn_nyt>yeah , prices are insane here
(10:26:53)<konijn_nyt>I pay like 4200 usd montly rent
(10:27:00)<ido>:O
(10:27:02)<konijn_nyt>of course, I have 3 children and a nanny
(10:27:06)<ido>how big is your place?
(10:27:15)<konijn_nyt>it's a 2 family home just for us
(10:27:28)<ido>inside the city?
(10:27:33)<konijn_nyt>no no
(10:27:37)<konijn_nyt>westchester
(10:27:48)<konijn_nyt>about manhattan is the bronx, above the bronx is westchester
(10:27:56)<konijn_nyt>*above manhattan
(10:28:06)<konijn_nyt>30 minutes train ride to times square
(10:28:13)<ido>not too bad
(10:28:27)<ido>i would call 30 mins "in nyc"
(10:28:39)<konijn_nyt>okay ;)
(10:28:42)<ido>or at least "in greater nyc"
(10:28:43)<konijn_nyt>nyc is realy small though
(10:29:17)<konijn_nyt>http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=40.961414,-73.729317&spn=0.001199,0.00294&t=h&z=19
(10:29:33)<konijn_nyt>the center wood street label, the house left of it, with the black roof
(10:29:34)<ido>ah
(10:29:42)<ido>that looks very suburban 
(10:29:45)<konijn_nyt>indeed
(10:29:50)<konijn_nyt>you cant really say that is nyc
(10:30:00)<ido>i thought it would be more urban 
(10:30:09)<konijn_nyt>noops
(10:30:31)<konijn_nyt>my previous house costed to much, but was way cooler
(10:31:16)<konijn_nyt>http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=80+Garden+Rd,+Scarsdale,+NY+10583&sll=40.961414,-73.729317&sspn=0.61393,1.505127&ie=UTF8&ll=41.006527,-73.773864&spn=0.000599,0.00147&t=h&z=20&iwloc=addr
(10:31:41)<konijn_nyt>this was also 30 minutes train ride to nyc
(10:32:35)<ido>looks like the setting of a zombie film 
(10:32:49)<ido>with all those dead trees around 
(10:36:09)<konijn_nyt>heheh
(10:36:38)<konijn_nyt>that's why autumn and snowless winter is so depressing here
(10:37:07)<ido>nyc's population density is only slightly more than tel aviv's 
(10:37:20)<RotateMe_witDog>konijn_nyt: where do you know ABAP from?
(10:37:21)<ido>10k/sq. km vs 7k
(10:37:39)<ido>but it is much bigger
(10:37:47)<konijn_nyt>Got course on my first job with Procter & Gamble in Brussels
(10:37:56)<ido>i figured the difference would be bigger
(10:38:00)<konijn_nyt>got 70% pay increase after I changed
(10:38:19)<RotateMe>k, i'm currently doing a work while study thing for the company which developed ABAP
(10:38:30)<ido>sap?
(10:38:30)<konijn_nyt>SAP ?
(10:39:05)<ido>(beat you by milliseconds) 
(10:39:16)<konijn_nyt>no on my screen ;)
(10:39:22)<ido>:O
(10:39:28)<ido>huh
(10:39:33)<RotateMe>ys
(10:39:36)<konijn_nyt>hmmm
(10:39:41)<konijn_nyt>which SAP office ?
(10:39:49)<RotateMe>Walldorf in germany
(10:39:50)<ido>i guess irc doesn't allow that kind of granuality 
(10:39:51)<RotateMe>the hq
(10:40:06)<konijn_nyt>wow
(10:40:08)<konijn_nyt>that is cool
(10:40:19)<konijn_nyt>so what's the study about ?
(10:40:24)<RotateMe>yeah it's nice to have income during your study but i will be switching though
(10:40:26)<konijn_nyt>how to kill ABAP with java ;)
(10:40:49)<RotateMe>no i think i chose the wrong words
(10:41:08)<RotateMe>not a study but i'm studying 3 month and working 3 months for 3 years
(10:41:22)<RotateMe>and after that the company may employ you in most cases
(10:42:01)<RotateMe>problem is 8 of 11 subjects in the university are economic subjects
(10:42:13)<RotateMe>only 2 are vaguely about IT
(10:42:25)<konijn_nyt>np for SAP I think
(10:42:30)<RotateMe>not my cup of tea so i'm thinking about doing something else
(10:42:31)<ido>what is your course of study 
(10:42:54)<RotateMe>business economics with information technology
(10:43:08)<ido>sounds boring 
(10:43:13)<RotateMe>yup
(10:43:34)<RotateMe>i guess i'll go for math with information technology :D
(10:44:53)<ido>actually it sounds more bourgeois than boring 
(10:46:37)<RotateMe>business economics?
(10:47:25)<ido>yes
(10:47:30)<ido>heh: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/TelAviv-paam4.jpg

(07:18:48)<ido>ask RotateMe

(07:20:02)<RotateMe>i knew i made too few comments ;)
(07:22:07)<ido>Santiago de Chile looks nice
(07:22:30)<ido>the quesetion is, can you find a job as a programmer there
(07:22:53)<konijn_nyt>sure I can
(07:23:09)<konijn_nyt>I would make less money of course
(07:23:12)<konijn_nyt>but hey
(07:23:21)<konijn_nyt>the weather would be better than here !
(07:25:19)<ido>huh
(07:25:19)<ido>not bad
(07:25:20)<konijn_nyt>indeed
(07:25:21)<konijn_nyt>architect-developer , but still
(07:25:37)<konijn_nyt>I would work for multi-national like I have done before
(07:25:43)<konijn_nyt>same sh*t, different country ;)
(07:26:03)<ido>have you worked there already?
(07:27:29)<konijn_nyt>noops
(07:27:38)<konijn_nyt>I worked in Belgium, Canada and US
(07:28:04)<konijn_nyt>but as I understand from my traveling collegues, it really is no different in South American capitals
(07:28:42)<ido>i've known some south americans here in europe
(07:28:53)<ido>mostly women in their 20's-30's
(07:28:59)<konijn_nyt>;)
(07:29:11)<ido>from what i;ve heard a lot fo the big cities over there are quite dangerous 
(07:29:19)<konijn_nyt>you have to be carefull
(07:29:37)<konijn_nyt>it's not as if nyc is heaven either
(07:29:47)<konijn_nyt>or tel aviv I imagine
(07:29:59)<ido>yes, well that depends 
(07:30:44)<ido>the problems in israel in that respect are from terrorism, not crime 
(07:31:17)<ido>and that tends to focus in the colonies and to a lesser jerusalem 
(07:31:50)<konijn_nyt>which reminds me
(07:32:01)<ido>in the past decade there have been very few terrorist activities in TA
(07:32:40)<konijn_nyt>Another potential location would also be Jordany
(07:32:49)<ido>jordan?
(07:32:52)<konijn_nyt>yes
(07:32:56)<konijn_nyt>my wife works with the UN
(07:33:00)<konijn_nyt>so I follow her
(07:33:06)<konijn_nyt>there is a big UNRA basis in Jordany
(07:33:19)<konijn_nyt>with schools/hospitals/etc for Palestinian refugees
(07:33:24)<ido>i don't think there is much of a  software industry over there 
(07:33:28)<konijn_nyt>indeed
(07:33:37)<konijn_nyt>oh well
(07:33:46)<konijn_nyt>maybe I would have to get into offshore model
(07:33:50)<konijn_nyt>compete with the Indians ;)
(07:33:58)<ido>you could commute to israel ;)
(07:34:06)<konijn_nyt>heheh
(07:34:18)<ido>the border is open since '94
(07:34:23)<ido>so it is allowed 
(07:34:27)<konijn_nyt>as I understand Jordan does not accept passports with Israel stamps
(07:34:34)<konijn_nyt>I could go , but not come back
(07:34:36)<ido>that not true
(07:34:41)<konijn_nyt>you sure ??
(07:34:45)<ido>you are thinking of Syria maybe
(07:34:51)<konijn_nyt>maybe
(07:34:53)<konijn_nyt>gtg
(07:35:44)<RotateMe>i'll be going too, bye!
(07:35:57)<ido>i should go to bed as well
(08:45:52)<konijn_wife>anybody still reading here ?
(08:45:55)<konijn_wife>I guess not
(08:45:59)<konijn_wife>I will play a bit with the bot

(09:18:45)<konijn_nyt>my apologies if you hate clutter
(09:51:53)<jomiolto>hmm, my 7drl is starting to look like a roguelike: http://www.hytti.uku.fi/~jmtoivan/apj.png :)
(09:54:11)<konijn_nyt>indeed it is
(09:54:51)<jomiolto>now it just has to feel like one too :)
(09:55:30)<konijn_nyt>As long as you have life, it will feel like it 
(09:55:34)<konijn_nyt>and not too silly controls
(09:56:29)<jomiolto>well, the idea is quite different from most other roguelikes
(09:56:51)<konijn_nyt>hmmm
(09:56:52)<jomiolto>at least according to my current plans there will be no actual fighting with monsters at all
(09:56:57)<konijn_nyt>ah
(09:57:00)<konijn_nyt>combat less 
(09:57:08)<konijn_nyt>i see you skipped on los ;)
(09:57:29)<jomiolto>not really, the los just isn't highlighted and I have explored almost the whole level in the screenie
(09:57:55)<jomiolto>the game does have a regular ray-casting with bresenhams' algorithms LOS
(09:58:51)<konijn_nyt>ah
(09:58:59)<konijn_nyt>okay
(09:59:09)<jomiolto>hmm, and I don't quite like the dungeon generation, but hopefully I'll have time to tweak it later
(09:59:13)<konijn_nyt>so you remember monster positions ?
(09:59:20)<konijn_nyt>or T and t are not monsters ?
(09:59:30)<jomiolto>nope, there aren't any monsters in the screenie :) they're all "items"
(09:59:41)<konijn_nyt>good enough

(10:02:39)<jomiolto>heh, I first thought of reusing an old dungeon generator I had written for another roguelike project, but the code was so awful and messy that it was easier to rewrite the whole thing according to the same general idea
(10:03:24)<konijn_nyt>its funny how we keep getting better at refactoring
(10:03:34)<konijn_nyt>I wonder how my code will look when I'm 60

(11:03:59)<Aerton>perhaps, SDL includes some system .h where it's defined
(11:04:23)<jomiolto>oh, right, "man connect" displays documentation of the function
(11:04:58)<Aerton>just rename yours
(11:05:09)<TMC>or make it static
(11:05:20)<Aerton>that would work too
(11:05:20)<jomiolto>hmm
(11:05:24)<TMC>(dungeon connection I assume?)
(11:05:33)<Aerton>if you only need it on one file
(11:05:44)<Aerton>but then it should be static anyway
(11:05:52)<jomiolto>renaming it words, but I still don't quite get why SDL ended up calling my "connect" function?
(11:06:21)<TMC>incidently, can the compiler do any extra optimisations on static fucntions?
(11:06:28)<jomiolto>and if function connect is already defined, then why didn't gcc warn me about it
(11:06:48)<TMC>hmm, maybe not, you could still possibly need a function pointer to a static function
(11:06:59)<Aerton>because compiler can't know about it
(11:07:11)<Aerton>the mess only occurs when you run the program
(11:07:36)<Aerton>compiler *may* optimise static functions
(11:07:46)<jomiolto>actually, now that I think of it, my gcc has been behaving oddly for sometime already
(11:08:01)<jomiolto>for some reason it often fails to warn me about functions having a wrong number of parameters
(11:08:02)<Aerton>no, that's normal behaviour
(11:08:11)<Aerton>do you use -Wall ?
(11:08:14)<jomiolto>yeah
(11:08:23)<Aerton>try -Wextra
(11:08:34)<Aerton>in addition
(11:09:01)<Aerton>-Wshadow is also nice
(11:09:07)<TMC>-Wshadow?
(11:09:30)<Aerton>warns if you overshadow a global variable name with a local one
(11:09:41)<TMC>ah
(11:11:29)<jomiolto>blah, it still lets me call a function with any number of parameters, no matter what the prototype of the function looks like
(11:11:32)<jomiolto>weird
(11:11:44)<Aerton>that's C, not C++ ?
(11:11:50)<jomiolto>yeah, plain C
(11:12:16)<Aerton>in C function names don't include info about parameters
(11:13:17)<jomiolto>yeah, but prototypes do
(11:13:31)<jomiolto>or whatever they're called
(11:13:45)<jomiolto>the "int function(blah blah);" things you put in .h files
(11:14:07)<Aerton>so what? that's runtime, not a compilation issue
(11:14:38)<jomiolto>gcc warns me about missing prototypes, but does nothing when the prototype exists, but the function is called with wrong number/type of parameters
(11:15:05)<Aerton>do you listen to me?
(11:15:08)<jomiolto>yes
(11:15:33)<Aerton>gcc can not complain about that issue
(11:15:46)<Aerton>SDL uses system header with system connect
(11:15:55)<Aerton>your code uses your header with our's
(11:16:07)<TMC>"ours"?
(11:16:10)<TMC>are you a SDL dev?
(11:16:21)<jomiolto>oh, I wasn't talking about that issue anymore
(11:16:21)<Aerton>duh, missed y :)
(11:16:30)<jomiolto>this happens with my own functions too
(11:16:47)<Aerton>since, they are compiled separately, the issue never occurs to gcc
(11:17:23)<Aerton>but in runtime, when you binary runs, it loads SDL
(11:17:34)<Aerton>SDL needs a functon named connect
(11:17:43)<Aerton>and your binary have it exported
(11:17:56)<Aerton>the glibc has connect too
(11:18:04)<Aerton>but your connect takes a priority
(11:18:26)<jomiolto>well, I renamed the function already and this weirdness still happens, even when I compile without SDL
(11:18:47)<Aerton>hm?
(11:19:03)<Aerton>what's a problem than?
(11:19:14)<jomiolto>if I have a function "int foo();", gcc lets me call it with *any* number of parameters
(11:19:34)<Aerton>that's correct
(11:19:41)<jomiolto>no matter what the prototype says, I can feed anything to the functions
(11:19:53)<Aerton>in C, int foo() is the same as int foo(...)
(11:20:02)<jomiolto>hmm?
(11:20:03)<Aerton>use int foo (void)
(11:20:13)<TMC>oo
(11:20:17)<TMC>I didn't know that
(11:20:29)<jomiolto>not in recent C, at least to my knowledge
(11:20:33)<Aerton>it's different from C++, where int foo() is the same as int foo(void)
(11:21:08)<TMC>reinforcing that C !subsetof C++
(11:21:53)<jomiolto>well, it happens with functions that have parameters too
(11:22:49)<jomiolto>for example, I have a "long dice(const char *str);" function and gcc lets me call it with any parameters I want
(11:23:19)<jomiolto>I can do "dice(10, "hello world!", 1.30F);" and gcc compiles it happily, but then it crashes when I run it
(11:23:21)<TMC>why don't you use dice(int,int) :(
(11:24:19)<jomiolto>I have a separate version with long parameters, called ldice :)
(11:24:48)<Aerton>try -Wmissing-prototypes
(11:24:56)<TMC>you've lost me
(11:24:59)<Aerton>sounds you don't have prototype visible where it's used
(11:25:16)<TMC>aren't long's 32bit on 32 bit machines?
(11:25:26)<TMC>(or am I confused with FB?)
(11:25:34)<Aerton>it is
(11:26:27)<jomiolto>long is anything with 32bits or more
(11:26:36)<TMC>well are you planning to compile your code on 16bit machines?
(11:26:48)<jomiolto>well, who knows :)
(11:27:26)<jomiolto>hmm, now I'm getting warnings again, weird :(
(11:27:57)<jomiolto>um, make that errors, of course
(11:28:27)<jomiolto>sometimes I get warnings of bad number of arguments, sometimes not
(11:29:49)<jomiolto>ah, it was a problem with makefiles
(11:30:17)<jomiolto>I had "-Wall" missing from some places
(11:31:02)<jomiolto>hmm, no that's not it either :(
(11:31:12)<jomiolto>I think I'm going insane, that must be it...
(11:35:34)<jomiolto>well, now everything seems to be okay, but I don't understand how I managed to compile bad code earlier

(02:01:21)<Aerton>standard is 80x24
(02:02:31)<Numeron>heh, yeah that one... is there a standard size larger though?

(06:11:54)<Aerton>no wonder spear is useless against colt or uzi

(06:12:48)<joe6pack>they actually did that in fallout 2,
(06:12:55)<joe6pack>but only at the veru beginning 
(06:13:45)<joe6pack>another problem is that in both games after a  certain point money ceases to make any difference 
(06:13:57)<joe6pack>you just start having way more than you can ever spend 
(06:14:47)<joe6pack>(these are all minor issues, btw - both games are superb) 
(06:16:48)<purestrain>i own both but never had time to play them though
(06:17:06)<joe6pack>:O
(06:17:24)<joe6pack>german version or original? 
(06:17:31)<purestrain>german i think
(06:17:47)<joe6pack>the german translation is especially horrendes 
(06:17:55)<joe6pack>you should download the english version
(06:18:13)<joe6pack>it makes a big difference 
(06:18:26)<joe6pack>the translators must have been on crack
(06:19:04)<joe6pack>these are some of the gratest games i have ever played 
(06:20:21)<Aerton>try wasteland, some ppl say it's better balanced
(06:20:34)<joe6pack>huh
(06:20:44)<Aerton>graphics are terrible, but should not be much of problem for an rl addict
(06:20:46)<joe6pack>should give it a try some time 
(06:21:00)<joe6pack>yea i think i've played it for a few minutes once
(06:25:39)<RotateMe>searching for wasteland made me stumble upon this
(06:25:39)<RotateMe>http://www.bastionsofwar.com/maps.html
(06:25:49)<RotateMe>which made me want to play neverwinter nights again
(06:31:23)<deveah>gmornin
(06:31:29)<joe6pack>hi
(06:31:45)<joe6pack>DarkGod: what are you up to these days?
(06:33:13)<deveah>":p" - ascii logo and text editor
(06:33:26)<deveah>mainly for roguelike start screen
(06:33:39)<DarkGod>preparing my wedding :)
(06:33:44)<joe6pack>:O
(06:33:49)<joe6pack>congrats 
(06:33:59)<deveah>wedding =o
(06:34:04)<DarkGod>thanks :)
(06:34:29)<deveah>no roguelike design after i see
(06:42:10)<RotateMe>congrats!
(06:43:40)<joe6pack>do you incorporate changes from V into tome?
(06:44:18)<joe6pack>seeing as development on v had been picking up pace once more
(06:45:21)<DarkGod>T3 is not really a variant of vanilla anymore I cant port changes just like that
(06:45:24)<DarkGod>anyawy what changes?
(06:45:54)<joe6pack>i don't know, i have been playing neither angband nor tome for years 
(06:46:06)<joe6pack>was just wondering if there is some cooperation going on
(06:47:19)<joe6pack>they are both just too slow paced for me (no offense) 
(06:48:30)<DarkGod>?
(06:49:04)<joe6pack>i am not sure what you're asking :)
(06:49:07)<TMC>the gameplay, or development?
(06:49:15)<joe6pack>TMC: gameplay 
(06:51:13)<DarkGod>why does it feels slow?
(06:51:16)<DarkGod>compared to what?
(06:51:39)<joe6pack>compared to crawl
(06:52:12)<joe6pack>and to a lot of minor games
(06:52:30)<RotateMe>can anybody tell me how to move diagonally in cracks and crevices win?
(06:52:40)<joe6pack>(like doomrl, which i know is not a fair comparison)
(06:53:01)<joe6pack>RotateMe: you have to change the default key binding 
(06:53:13)<joe6pack>read the readme file
(06:53:19)<joe6pack>it's easy
(06:53:36)<joe6pack>you just need to copy some file that's there or cahnge its name or something of that sort
(06:53:37)<Glowie>I don't know about Angband's speed, but it's the grinding that doesn't suit me personally
(06:53:48)<Glowie>I don't like being able to camp the floors as many times as I want
(06:53:52)<joe6pack>i don't know why stu did it this way
(06:54:41)<TMC>yeah, silly :P
(06:55:03)<joe6pack>Glowie: yes, i find that tome, albit better in that respect than angband, suffers from this same problem
(07:02:12)<Glowie>Uhm, does anyone know where to find Mac's platform dependent functions documented?
(07:02:40)<joe6pack>though i've only ever played the 2.x branch. i don't know if you've changed that in 3
(07:10:29)<deveah>i want a roguelike. 7drl is preferred
(07:10:43)<deveah>ascii please
(07:11:27)<joe6pack>did you try that last one?
(07:11:31)<joe6pack>with the mage?
(07:11:36)<joe6pack>that was fun
(07:11:37)<deveah>no, what one?
(07:11:45)<joe6pack>don't remember the name
(07:12:04)<joe6pack>with the small screen size
(07:12:08)<joe6pack>and the shops
(07:12:10)<Numeron>crown of the forest
(07:12:14)<joe6pack>yes
(07:12:15)<Numeron>mine :)
(07:12:16)<deveah>oh, crown'o'dah'forest
(07:12:26)<deveah>nah, else?
(07:12:57)<joe6pack>don't know. that was the only recent 7drl i've enjoyed playing 
(07:12:59)<deveah>*random page on rlbasin*
(07:13:10)<joe6pack>(otehr than mine, that is ;p )
(07:14:19)<Numeron>im started a larger scale project a couple of days ago using the same idea as in crown... calling in wizard arena
(07:14:49)<joe6pack>nice
(07:15:09)<joe6pack>i am edging to do a larger scale game myself
(07:15:22)<joe6pack>but i have to focus on my studies atm
(07:15:34)<joe6pack>can't afford such a distraction right now
(07:18:18)<deveah>i'm gonna make a rogue-style room generator
(07:19:08)<TMC>using the link of the day? :P
(07:19:12)<deveah>nah, too lazy
(07:19:24)<deveah>i was thinking of reading it
(07:19:52)<TMC>"calling in wizard arena"?
(07:19:55)<joe6pack>too lazy to read half a page of text, but not too lazy to implement what it describes?
(07:19:58)<TMC>is that the name of the game?
(07:20:09)<TMC>BTW, I beat crown yesterday
(07:20:13)<TMC>very nice :)
(07:20:37)<Numeron>yeah spelling mistake.. in = it
(07:20:40)<Numeron>thanks
(07:20:51)<TMC>oh
(07:21:02)<TMC>you have to steal something?
(07:21:10)<TMC>I really like the idea
(07:21:25)<TMC>or having possession for the longest?
(07:22:14)<joe6pack>ah. i should "borrow" the stealing idea for my next game ;)
(07:22:59)<Numeron>i plan to have a few different arenas in my game... one which is a free for all posession, a team play one too... 
(07:23:20)<Numeron>other arenas which are jsut survival etc
(07:29:35)<TMC>all without perma death?
(07:30:19)<TMC>I like the idea of stealing an important artifact without killing in regular rl's too
(07:31:08)<TMC>they need ways to shove someone down stairs and make them drop their weapon, or everything to fall out of their backpack, for example
(07:31:11)<joe6pack>heh. Massachusetts seems to have the biggest cryptrover players community in the world ;)
(07:31:19)<Numeron>no permadeath in the arenas, but permadeath in the world (which you ahve to explore for reasons I havent thought up yet)
(07:31:31)<joe6pack>google analytics is so cool 
(07:32:07)<joe6pack>and non of them from boston!
(07:32:14)<joe6pack>all from small towns 
(07:32:52)<TMC>hmm
(07:32:57)<TMC>how many of them?
(07:34:06)<joe6pack>146 world wide; 42 from the us; 5 from Massachusetts 
(07:34:21)<joe6pack>pretty spread out all over the world, actually 
(07:34:47)<joe6pack>no single concentration in any city or province 
(07:36:02)<joe6pack>wrt single cities
(07:36:21)<joe6pack>the top are Bucharest and Warsaw
(07:36:29)<TMC>I didn't know it could get you locations that specific
(07:36:31)<joe6pack>both with 3 visitors 
(07:36:45)<TMC>g'night
(07:36:50)<joe6pack>good night
(07:37:18)<RotateMe>Numeron, i'm planning to do an arena rl too, but only 7drl
(07:37:20)<RotateMe>http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/RogueArena%20Design.txt
(07:37:34)<RotateMe>wrote this at work instead of working ;)
(07:39:07)<RotateMe>hmm the formatting seems to be messed up, i copy pasted it via a wts connection
(07:41:06)<Numeron>looks very cool. I think its a fair bit different from what i have planned :)
(07:42:18)<Numeron>i like this idea: "sudden death:
(07:42:18)<Numeron>the arena get's flooded: water flows from one point into the arena. characters in the water loose some hp per
(07:43:01)<purestrain>well; but realtime and very fast?
(07:43:45)<purestrain>don't have roguelikes to be played without sweating? ;-)
(07:44:48)<xGrue>well what if you just finished jogging?
(07:45:06)<purestrain>usually i take a shower
(07:45:09)<RotateMe>that was my thoughts to xGrue ;D
(07:45:40)<purestrain>make time variable at least
(07:45:50)<RotateMe>yeah but "very fast" goes a bit too far i guess
(07:46:26)<RotateMe>i think i'm going to release a very small demo of dungeonhunter
(07:46:30)<Numeron>you could make it so you only have x seconds to make your turn or its considered a wait.. that makes it easy to add difficulty levels
(07:46:33)<RotateMe>my bug list is too empty
(07:46:52)<RotateMe>Numeron, the system works in a different way
(07:47:19)<RotateMe>each action takes some time and after you did the action you have to wait that number of frames
(07:47:42)<RotateMe>after that you are considered "ready" and keypresses/ai input will be accepted
(07:48:09)<RotateMe>this way the game speed doesn't vary
(07:48:46)<xGrue>this gonna be a 7drl or a real project?
(07:49:06)<RotateMe>dungeonhunter = real, roguearena 7drl
(07:49:28)<RotateMe>it's a bit stuffed, i know
(07:49:51)<xGrue>meh i have plans for a 7drl thats gonna be fairly tough to pull off in 7 days
(07:50:18)<RotateMe>i will try to learn to use jice's doryen library effectively, add some stuff here and there
(07:50:34)<RotateMe>but i want to do the rl related stuff in the 7 days
(07:50:50)<RotateMe>so no fov, dungeon generation or anything before that
(07:51:17)<xGrue>have any ideas of what youre gonna use?
(07:51:26)<xGrue>or will it be brainstormed up during the 7 days?
(07:52:53)<deveah>i want YOU"RE A PIRATE NOW!!!
(07:53:26)<xGrue>whats that?
(07:53:54)<RotateMe>like i said, i'm using jice's doryen library with c++
(07:54:04)<xGrue>never heard of it :P
(07:54:34)<purestrain>wah; c++ ugly :P
(07:55:02)<RotateMe>http://jice.nospam.googlepages.com/thedoryenlibrary
(07:55:13)<RotateMe>yeah or c, i don't know
(07:55:21)<RotateMe>there's a version for both
(07:56:07)<RotateMe>oh i just see that this already has fov support
(08:09:32)<RotateMe>joe6pack, have you been at the viennale?

(08:29:24)<joe6pack>i try to go every year 
(08:31:42)<joe6pack>i don't think i would like a real time rl
(08:31:59)<joe6pack>i like leaving the game open in the middle and going to do other things
(08:32:06)<joe6pack>like chat :)
(08:32:40)<joe6pack>and then coming back, play for a few turns, read something on the web, etc..
(08:32:55)<joe6pack>it is rarely the *only* thing i do at any given time

(08:41:53)<konijn_bed>'bestial side' -> There should be fear of fire
(08:42:20)<RotateMe>joe6pack, what and whom did you see?
(08:42:39)<RotateMe>my sister studies in vienna and she just told me she watched no country for old men there
(08:42:47)<joe6pack>ah
(08:42:50)<konijn_nyt>roll 5d6
(08:42:50)<null>12
(08:42:57)<joe6pack>i've wanted to watch that one
(08:42:59)<RotateMe>roll 1d0
(08:42:59)<null>1
(08:43:01)<joe6pack>but iwas too late
(08:43:02)<RotateMe>buuuug
(08:43:07)<konijn_nyt>yeah
(08:43:08)<joe6pack>was already sold out
(08:43:10)<konijn_nyt>bug is fixed
(08:43:12)<RotateMe>ah too bad
(08:43:14)<konijn_nyt>need to restart
(08:43:20)<RotateMe>k
(08:43:26)<RotateMe>and why doesn't that work:
(08:43:31)<RotateMe>roll 473d34
(08:43:37)<RotateMe>roll 473d3
(08:43:41)<RotateMe>roll 47d34

(08:44:13)<konijn_nyt>it does up to 2 numbers on dicecount, up to 3 for dicesides
(08:44:30)<RotateMe>okay
(08:44:41)<RotateMe>is this actual code?
(08:44:43)<konijn_nyt>should be useful in most rl situations
(08:44:46)<konijn_nyt>yes
(08:44:56)<RotateMe>yeah it's enough just wondered why
(08:45:07)<konijn_nyt>lets see if I get kicked ;)
(08:45:09)<RotateMe>i would have done it totally different
(08:45:14)<konijn_nyt>		} else if (message.startsWith("roll") ) {

(08:46:15)<joe6pack>konijn_nyt: why only 2 chars for the number? why not use '+'?
(08:46:20)<RotateMe>the "bug" is a philosphical problem
(08:46:42)<joe6pack>RotateMe: no it isn't. a D0 dice only has the value 0 
(08:46:52)<joe6pack>D1, on the other hand...
(08:47:32)<RotateMe>well there are no events with 0 possible outcomes
(08:47:56)<joe6pack>yes there are
(08:48:32)<joe6pack>(e.g. casting a D0 dice)
(08:48:40)<Numeron>a die with no sides can have no values.. 0 is a value
(08:49:07)<RotateMe>well that again is just a definition
(08:49:15)<joe6pack>so the answer should be NAN?
(08:49:20)<RotateMe>for the only possible outcome
(08:49:37)<RotateMe>you can see the problem that he had to treat this case differently
(08:51:18)<RotateMe>joe6pack, no i think Numeron is right, most people would define the result of a d0 as 0 and furthermore it's possible to have weapons in rl's that treat d0 damage
(08:51:38)<joe6pack>ok
(08:51:54)<Numeron>why would you want a weapon that deals d0 damage?
(08:52:07)<RotateMe>dammit i have unconnected sections in the dungeons i generate :(
(08:52:11)<xGrue>java!!
(08:52:16)<RotateMe>d0 + x
(08:52:17)<joe6pack>now *that* is a philosophical question 
(08:52:35)<Numeron>ah
(08:52:39)<joe6pack>RotateMe: in other words 'x'
(08:53:03)<xGrue>what about 100d0 + x
(08:53:06)<RotateMe>ys
(08:53:10)<joe6pack>x
(08:53:16)<xGrue>10000000d0 + x?
(08:53:18)<joe6pack>still x
(08:53:21)<RotateMe>lol :D
(08:53:26)<joe6pack>0*... = 0
(08:53:43)<xGrue>0*1/0   != 0
(08:53:51)<joe6pack>1/0 is not defined 
(08:54:04)<xGrue>which isnt zero
(08:54:23)<joe6pack>"not equal" != "not defined" 
(08:54:25)<Numeron>its remainder 1 ;)
(08:54:37)<RotateMe>btw, is the random seed somehow initialized
(08:54:44)<RotateMe>with the current time or s.th.?
(08:54:50)<xGrue>whats "not defined" in code?
(08:54:52)<xGrue>error?
(08:54:59)<joe6pack>i guess
(08:55:00)<Numeron>null?
(08:55:07)<RotateMe>""
(08:55:13)<joe6pack>it is like writing "x=yo!;" in c
(08:55:26)<xGrue>lol
(08:55:29)<joe6pack>it is somply not allowed 
(08:55:41)<RotateMe>yo!
(08:55:56)<joe6pack>int x=yo!;
(08:58:21)<RotateMe>any ideas on how to connect unconnected dungeon sections when the only information are the value 1=wall 0=nothing for each tile?
(08:58:36)<RotateMe>(so no extra stuff like an array with the rooms etc.)
(08:58:58)<joe6pack>draw a line of 0's between them?
(08:59:23)<RotateMe>well how do i know what are the sections?
(08:59:36)<joe6pack>do it during the dungeon digging, not afterwards
(08:59:47)<RotateMe>take pairs of points and try pathfinding?
(08:59:48)<joe6pack>every time you dig a room you have it's center 
(09:00:01)<joe6pack>that seems like a slow way of doing it
(09:00:59)<joe6pack>just make sure you rooms are connected to one another while you create them, don't go digging rooms willy nilly and then try to find unconnected ones 
(09:02:06)<Numeron>im not a big fan on dungeon levels where every room except 2 have 2 exits only
(09:02:37)<joe6pack>who says they only have to have 2 exits?
(09:03:22)<Numeron>if you arent storing the rooms as you create them, then arent you drilling a corridor, make a room, drill corridor make room etc? you cant go back to rooms and make more corridors
(09:03:28)<joe6pack>look at the way i did it here: http://code.google.com/p/cryptrover/source/browse/trunk/map.c
(09:03:40)<joe6pack>in dig_level()
(09:04:00)<joe6pack>i dig more than 1 corrdor every time 
(09:04:19)<joe6pack>i dig a random amount of corridors for from each room
(09:04:51)<Numeron>ah i see
(09:05:09)<joe6pack>                        int paths=1+rand()%PATHS;
(09:07:52)<konijn_nyt>google code rocks
(09:08:00)<konijn_nyt>I _love_ the new svn browse thing
(09:08:15)<xGrue>yeah i need to start using that
(09:08:15)<joe6pack>yea it's rockin'
(09:08:54)<joe6pack>i suggest you setup a page for the bot there
(09:10:11)<joe6pack>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/2/14/203728/938
(09:10:15)<konijn_nyt>I will !
(09:10:31)<konijn_nyt>brunch any minute now
(09:10:39)<konijn_nyt>that'll take a while ;)
(09:10:46)<konijn_nyt>then I set up a google code project
(09:10:49)<joe6pack>time
(09:10:49)<null>joe6pack: The time is now Sun Feb 17 09:10:49 EST 2008
(09:10:58)<joe6pack>brunch do early?
(09:11:10)<joe6pack>that's not even time for breakfast yet
(09:11:16)<konijn_nyt>we still need to get to the brunch place by car
(09:11:23)<joe6pack>oh
(09:11:29)<joe6pack>i thought you're having it at home 
(09:11:32)<konijn_nyt>and when you have kids, these schedules tend to change ;)
(09:13:50)<joe6pack>"A young woman named Esther Howland immigrated to the United States, dismayed at not having received a single Valentine during her 20 years in England. She established a small card company in Massachusetts, with cards tailored to both men and women. American consumers were thrilled at the possibility of marginalizing relationships to hollow slogans and meaningless gifts in exchange for greater copulation."
(09:17:10)<Numeron>i didnt give my gf a card on valentines.. i bought her a bunch of roses though :) then we sneaked a bottle of vodka into the movies
(09:17:18)<Numeron>good times
(09:17:57)<xGrue>vodka!
(09:18:32)<Numeron>what better way to celebrate a relationship than get totally trashed in the middle of the day in public
(09:18:51)<joe6pack>none whatsoever 
(09:18:58)<deveah>i hate valentines day
(09:19:06)<deveah>i hate it's celebrated in Romania
(09:19:38)<joe6pack>if i didn't have an internet connection i wouldn't have even known it's now
(09:19:50)<Numeron>how come u hate it?
(09:19:55)<joe6pack>it isn't really that visible over here 
(09:20:13)<konijn_nyt>I went to  a Belgian place and have a beer wit Ms konijn
(09:21:17)<deveah>NUmeron: i hate it because it's not Romanian - and those who brought non-romanian holidays here want Romania to split
(09:21:42)<deveah>like the filthy hungarians : they want Covasna and Harghita, together with all our resources
(09:21:46)<joe6pack>burn the evil foreigners! 
(09:22:23)<joe6pack>deveah: it is actually your precious bodily fluids they are after 
(09:22:31)<deveah>and in the 1700-1800's the hungarians took romanian people, mainly kids and pregnant women into barns which they burnt
(09:22:54)<konijn_nyt>ew
(09:23:05)<joe6pack>9/11/1701 NEVER FORGET 
(09:23:25)<Numeron>valenties day isnt hungarian either though...
(09:23:41)<deveah>yes, it's true - and because they have power - they made romanian people learn hungarian-ass language where they are a minority
(09:23:45)<joe6pack>Numeron: HUNGARIAN SYMPATHIZER!!!
(09:23:46)<konijn_nyt>valentine's day is Catholic from the start
(09:23:52)<deveah>and they treat us like shit in our own country
(09:24:01)<xGrue>DJGPP good for windows?
(09:24:07)<konijn_nyt>hmmm
(09:24:09)<konijn_nyt>old
(09:24:39)<deveah>and i'm all anti-hungarian anti-gipsy anti-valentinesday anti-hungarian AND anti-hungarian
(09:24:39)<xGrue>any other suggestions?
(09:24:50)<joe6pack>Numeron is a magyar enabler 
(09:24:58)<deveah>yarr arr
(09:25:11)<Numeron>the catholic holidays we have today are such bastardized versions of what they are supposed to be anyway... just look at santa clause and xmas trees and stuff.. where the f does that come from? to me valentines day is totally not religious, but is a day to recognise love and relationships
(09:25:37)<deveah>now, the ass-licking hunarians posted anti-romanian clips on the web because they want all our resources and to destroy us
(09:25:44)<deveah>clips=vids
(09:25:52)<joe6pack>a day to recognize the exchange of flowers&cards for sex
(09:26:07)<Numeron>who doesnt like sex?
(09:26:10)<Numeron>:P
(09:26:24)<deveah>hunagrians - they like calling us names

(10:02:37)<konijn_mac>yes
(10:02:42)<konijn_mac>you are added to the project ;)
(10:02:47)<Glowie>Were you ignoring queries a moment ago?
(10:02:57)<konijn_mac>My laptop died
(10:03:01)<Glowie>Oh.
(10:03:08)<konijn_mac>one of my kids had disconnected the power cable
(10:03:13)<Glowie>I tried to query you, but I can ask here too
(10:03:13)<Glowie>Haha
(10:03:26)<Glowie>Do you know where I could find Mac's platform dependent functions with documentation?
(10:03:33)<konijn_mac>oooh
(10:03:35)<konijn_mac>sure
(10:03:38)<konijn_mac>hold on
(10:03:40)<Glowie>Excellent :)
(10:03:42)<konijn_mac>it's heavy though
(10:03:47)<Glowie>No worries
(10:04:10)<Glowie>I'm trying to make things as easy as possible for the one who compiles my game for Mac
(10:04:13)<konijn_mac>C language right ?
(10:04:15)<Glowie>Yes
(10:04:21)<konijn_mac>uhm, curses ?
(10:04:33)<konijn_mac>or graphical ?
(10:04:48)<konijn_mac>if it is curses, it should compile just fine
(10:04:53)<konijn_mac>Mac -> BSD
(10:04:54)<Glowie>Curses
(10:05:02)<Glowie>But I use some platform dependent functions
(10:05:05)<konijn_mac>so you dont need any stinkin' documentation

(05:02:33)<jomiolto>hmm, jice doesn't irc here by any chance?
(05:06:59)<oeb>joe, that bot could get quickly hated, response to help should probably be over /msg
(05:10:19)<joe6pack>you tell konijn_mac that
(05:10:36)<joe6pack>he's developing it 
(05:13:17)<joe6pack>but i think that's a good idea
(05:13:53)<joe6pack>you should write it down here: http://code.google.com/p/rgrdbot/issues/entryhttp://code.google.com/p/rgrdbot/issues/entry
(05:14:48)<joe6pack>oeb: do you have a google account? like gmail for example?
(05:18:42)<oeb>yup
(05:19:01)<joe6pack>what's your gmail address? 
(05:19:21)<oeb>what.will.i.do.with.a.gig@gmail.com
(05:19:41)<joe6pack>good
(05:19:51)<joe6pack>now you can enter your bug report 
(05:20:29)<joe6pack>http://code.google.com/p/rgrdbot/issues/entry
(05:20:44)<joe6pack>i pasted it twice by mistake the 1st time 
(05:21:09)<jomiolto>nice, I didn't know google groups automagically cut long lines, so I did my own formatting and now the post came out all wonky :/
(05:22:09)<joe6pack>yea, just write it without thinking about new lines, it'll be ok
(05:22:37)<jomiolto>hmm, and I think it used my nick name too, instead of my real name
(05:22:43)<jomiolto>I wonder where I can change that?
(05:22:50)<jomiolto>nothing in the profile thingy...
(05:23:13)<joe6pack>https://www.google.com/accounts/EditUserInfo?hl=en

(05:23:39)<jomiolto>ah, thanks joe6pack 
(05:23:47)<joe6pack>:)
(05:23:49)<joe6pack>np
(05:25:04)<joe6pack>oeb: 1 step closer to haveing you take over bot development... 
(05:25:07)<jomiolto>hah, it didn't allow me to leave the nickname blank, so I entered my real name to it: bad google page design 0 - me 1 :)
(05:35:29)<oeb>Step 1: Raise Issue
(05:35:38)<oeb>Step 2: Re-Learn Java
(05:35:43)<oeb>Step 3: ???
(05:35:50)<oeb>Step 4: Profit!
(05:36:07)<joe6pack>you don't need to learn a lot of java. just look at the code already written 
(05:36:48)<oeb>Ok Step 3: is overcome my all consuming lazyness.
(05:36:52)<joe6pack>it shouldn't be difficult to modify the help command to append a "/msg nick" to the answer 
(05:38:15)<oeb>Got an interesting book yesterday, amongst other things it talks about writing a 3d maze application in javascript. Thinking about taking it and sticking a random maze generator in there.
(07:19:32)<RotateMe>:D great story (link of the day)
(07:22:30)<joe6pack>should change it to this one, for eyenot: http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/cursesix.html
(07:22:57)<joe6pack>he was complaining about the lack of a standard way to do all kinds of terminal handling 
(07:23:10)<joe6pack>but curses *is* a standard 
(07:23:28)<joe6pack>it is an offcial part of The Single UNIX Specification
(07:24:03)<joe6pack>so every conforming platform *must* provide a curses implementation 
(07:28:48)<joe6pack>quote curses, http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/cursesix.html

(07:43:35)<RotateMe>has the pircbot methods for sending files? it would be cool if he could send you the log.txt on request
(07:49:06)<joe6pack>not that i know of
(07:49:19)<joe6pack>but go ahead, add it to the list...

(07:51:50)<RotateMe>google code is just as slow as scourceforge, no?
(07:57:38)<RotateMe>well all the stuff from the todo and ideas section should go there
(07:57:51)<RotateMe>i think there are some points left but the botowner has to look at this

(08:48:07)<cakeboy>SNOW DAY
(08:48:10)<cakeboy>snow day today
(08:49:11)<joe6pack>haven't seen snow in a *long* while
(08:49:21)<joe6pack>it's 13C outside 
(08:56:19)<cakeboy>first snow day in my 4 semesters of college
(08:56:24)<cakeboy>(that i didn't declare myself)
(08:56:55)<RotateMe>i forgot how good crawl was... killed my third char today
(08:57:14)<RotateMe>two times by friggin sigmund
(08:57:31)<joe6pack>that sigmund is something, isn't he?
(08:57:47)<joe6pack>i also often get killed by ghosts of past players 
(09:00:27)<cakeboy>happens to me a lot too
(09:00:46)<cakeboy>i'm no good at crawl still  :(
(09:01:22)<joe6pack>jesus christ! 15c in February! 
(09:01:23)<RotateMe>are those tutorials new? they're awesome
(09:01:35)<RotateMe>in vienna?
(09:01:37)<joe6pack>which tutorials?
(09:01:46)<RotateMe>in crawl ss
(09:01:47)<joe6pack>yes
(09:01:58)<RotateMe>that's sure hot for vienna
(09:01:59)<joe6pack>(to the weather, not the tuts)
(09:02:09)<joe6pack>yes
(09:02:21)<joe6pack>last winter was warm as well, though 
(09:02:22)<RotateMe>tutorials: press T in the char slection screen
(09:02:35)<joe6pack>never seen them
(09:02:43)<joe6pack>will take a look next time
(09:02:59)<joe6pack>have to get back to learning... :|
(09:03:10)<RotateMe>kk
(09:03:32)<joe6pack>damn, and in such a nice day as well
(09:06:12)<cakeboy>man
(09:06:15)<cakeboy>github is the greatest
(09:06:24)<cakeboy>i wish i had some beta invites to hand out
(09:16:13)<RotateMe>ooops, a cursed rings ring of teleportation :D
(09:16:17)<RotateMe>that's gonna be fun
(09:16:32)<RotateMe>cakeboy, what's github?
(09:17:45)<RotateMe>killed sigmund :D, with elvish arrows of ice
(09:19:31)<cakeboy>git is a version control system, it's my favorite so far
(09:19:43)<cakeboy>and github is a beta service that lets you host as many projects as you want
(09:19:49)<cakeboy>except it is beta and invite only :(
(09:20:14)<RotateMe>ah, too bad
(09:20:29)<RotateMe>well i've never done version control anyways...
(09:20:49)<cakeboy>it's cool when you have a couple different computers and you want to sync your projects
(09:20:53)<cakeboy>that what i use it for, anyway
(09:20:58)<cakeboy>plus it lets everyone else have access to it
(09:21:04)<RotateMe>for some reason i never had problems but i can sure think of times when it would become handy
(09:21:16)<RotateMe>ah okay
(09:25:56)<cakeboy>i like how some games, just because i'm on linux, assume that i like the vi keys
(09:26:01)<cakeboy>i hate the vi keys
(09:37:55)<RotateMe>i don't like how i just got pwnd :(
(09:51:28)<deveah>hello all

(09:53:40)<deveah>oh, i've seen this on my mobile
(09:54:40)<joe6pack>deveah: why don't you take up the bot's development? i think konijn might have had enough of it 
(09:55:09)<deveah>in what language?
(09:55:13)<joe6pack>jasva
(09:55:14)<joe6pack>java]
(09:55:17)<joe6pack>java
(09:55:33)<joe6pack>but you don't need to know it before hand
(09:55:49)<joe6pack>just look at the code we have already written
(09:56:06)<deveah>hmmm.....
(09:56:11)<deveah>ok then
(09:56:16)<joe6pack>\o/
(09:57:27)<deveah>where's the download?
(09:57:45)<joe6pack>http://code.google.com/p/rgrdbot/source/checkout
(09:57:47)<joe6pack>but first
(09:58:11)<deveah>brb lunch
(09:58:28)<joe6pack>write konijn_mac and email and ask him to commit the changes (includeing the log) and turn it off on his computer
(09:58:49)<joe6pack>so that we get a consistent log

(11:02:53)<Aerton>hadn't you hear a story of a teacher who first turned the power off and then asked students to save their work?
(11:03:42)<Aerton>he was kind enough to turn it again on when they started to cry 
(11:03:52)<joe6pack_away>vim would let you do that anyway. you have to add a ! inorder to quit a file you've made changes to 
(11:04:07)<joe6pack_away>s/would/wouldn't 
(11:04:53)<Aerton>hush!
(11:04:54)<Aerton>I've told a whole story to hide my stupid typo!
(11:06:09)<Aerton>btw, after looking at your screenshot, I run vim alongside the irc on the same screen ^^
(11:06:32)<joe6pack_away>heh
(11:06:54)<joe6pack_away>i now run irssi on a second monitor 
(11:07:12)<deveah>what screenie?
(11:07:24)<joe6pack_away>should have thought about hooking it up to my laptop a long time ago

(11:08:23)<oeb>One of these days I will have the courage to install linux on my main desktop.
(11:08:45)<oeb>I can do all my work stuff on my laptop, and that runs ubuntu.
(11:08:53)<deveah>i think i'm gonna start a new rl - a med-sized one.
(12:27:23)<joe6pack>deveah: did you sent konijn an email?
(01:19:33)<deveah>reg
(01:19:51)<deveah>joe6pack no, busy with homework
(01:19:56)<joe6pack>ok
(01:20:07)<deveah>and i want to test something new now

(07:50:36)<RotateMe>whOOt! just started a char in crawl and equipped a cursed weapon... i wanted to throw him right away and start anew but i had still one scroll in my inventory
(07:51:04)<RotateMe>i read it for fun and "it [felt] like something [was] helping [me]"
(07:51:20)<RotateMe>the weapon was uncursed and the char can continue :D
(08:03:58)<RotateMe>hmm i think i will start to make an ascii mode for dungeonhunter
(08:55:57)<deveah_>i want a cave generator
(08:56:03)<deveah_>or a crypt generator
(08:56:06)<deveah_>or a map generator
(08:56:15)<deveah_>i don't care, i want it! :((
(09:01:08)<joe6pack>there are a ton of those in the internet 
(09:03:47)<Glowie>Write one yourself, it's a lot more fun
(09:04:37)<joe6pack>well yea, but he can get *inspired* by existing ones...
(09:05:09)<Glowie>Sure can
(09:05:34)<joe6pack>there is so much info about it that there's really no excuse not to do it
(09:09:52)<deveah_>i don't know where to start :/
(09:14:36)<joe6pack>you can start with this:
(09:14:46)<joe6pack>#include <curses.h>
(09:14:52)<joe6pack>int main(){
(09:14:54)<deveah>haha
(09:14:55)<deveah>lol
(09:15:07)<joe6pack>and at the end
(09:15:08)<joe6pack>}
(09:15:13)<joe6pack>now just fillup the gaps 
(09:15:25)<deveah>does curses.h have a generator?
(09:15:32)<joe6pack>for what?
(09:15:35)<joe6pack>for a map?
(09:15:38)<deveah>yes
(09:15:40)<joe6pack>no
(09:15:41)<deveah>if not then no
(09:15:52)<Glowie>I'd suggest reading the old roguelikedevelopment.org articles from RogueBasin
(09:15:56)<Glowie>Those gave me a good start
(09:16:01)<deveah>i'm going rogue.
(09:16:17)<deveah>rogue-style rooms
(09:16:22)<joe6pack>http://jice.nospam.googlepages.com/basicdungeongeneration
(09:16:45)<deveah>kind of like that
(09:17:02)<joe6pack>it explains exactly how to do it 
(09:28:12)<deveah>brb
(09:30:46)<Aerton>duh, just buy a pike from the general store and start to dig
(09:31:07)<Aerton>wands of stone to mud might be helpful, but the price bites
(09:38:09)<RotateMe>grumble... i have to prerender the ascii bitmaps to display them in different colors... what a crappy language :(
(09:42:18)<purestrain>encountered next bug in D :P
(10:25:57)<konijn_mac>I still prefer this one : http://kuoi.com/~kamikaze/GameDesign/art07_rogue_dungeon.php
(10:42:42)<joe6pack>i think the pics really help
(10:43:11)<joe6pack>makes it much easier to understand 
(10:46:58)<purestrain>and of course you can have a difficult passage, since the level is basically divided into two parts with one corridor
(10:47:09)<purestrain>puts lots of orcs there :-)
(10:47:30)<purestrain>and one goal on each side
(10:49:19)<konijn_mac>yeah, I dont know
(10:49:36)<konijn_mac>I guess I get my specs in textual format, so I can deal better with that ;)
(10:51:14)<purestrain>for the lazy ones http://dungeonmaker.sourceforge.net/
(10:53:00)<joe6pack>is that yours?
(10:53:15)<purestrain>no ;-)
(10:53:46)<joe6pack>the name sounds familiar 
(10:53:54)<joe6pack>but i don't remeber from where 
(10:54:45)<joe6pack>also
(10:54:50)<joe6pack>no screen shots 
(10:56:13)<purestrain>http://dungeonmaker.sourceforge.net/DM2_Manual/ <- here are some
(10:56:41)<joe6pack>oh yea
(01:53:58)<Nasareti1ainen>what the?
(01:54:09)<jomiolto>there
(01:54:31)<Glowie>Ate a few mushrooms, changed the name and forgot you did it?
(01:54:38)<jomiolto>I think I need to tweak my irssi settings :(
(01:54:57)<jomiolto>nah, it's just that I irc in two different networks, and irssi seems to default to the same nick in both of them
(01:56:12)<jomiolto>and, besides, you're making me sad, because it's winter and all the tasty 'shrooms are covered under a foot of snow :(
(01:56:33)<Glowie>I thought you had an in-door mushroom farm :b
(01:57:23)<jomiolto>nah, the one's grown by mother nature taste better (and given nicer hallucinations :)
(01:58:28)<jomiolto>sigh... 9pm already, and I was supposed to get some code done today :(
(01:58:50)<Glowie>I debugged one bastard of a bug for 2 hours ^_^
(01:59:03)<jomiolto>that's nice :)
(01:59:32)<Glowie>It wasn't that nice after 1,5 hours of debugging
(02:00:25)<jomiolto>well, at least for me it depends on what the bug if like; if it's something blindingly obvious that you should have noticed immediately, then it's not fun, but if it's something really obscure and difficult, then it's a great feeling to actually find the bug
(02:01:22)<Glowie>It was a great feeling, and it certainly wasn't obvious. Rather hard to reproduce too... The player had to be unarmed, paralyzed and use double strike special skill to make it appear :(
(02:01:40)<Glowie>(It was caused by overflowing message buffer when the player is paralyzed)
(02:01:48)<jomiolto>oh
(02:02:50)<jomiolto>it has sometimes taken me a week to find some similar bugs (although I didn't spend week doing just debugging, but also did some other stuff)
(02:03:12)<jomiolto>and, actually, I've once run into a bug in GCC, some years ago
(02:03:45)<jomiolto>that definitely wasn't fun when you spent a day debugging your code and found out that nothing was acutlly wrong...
(02:03:46)<Glowie>"And then I thought, ha! The bug must be in the compiler!" Something similar was someone's signature in RGRD :P
(02:04:13)<Glowie>Did you report that GCC's bug
(02:04:52)<jomiolto>nah, I didn't have a stable internet connection back then and I was actually using an old version
(02:05:16)<Glowie>Oh
(02:05:17)<jomiolto>I'm not sure I would have ever discovered the problem, had I not known assembler
(02:05:56)<Glowie>Nice, someone has benefited from knowing assembly :P
(02:06:01)<jomiolto>:D
(02:06:29)<Glowie>So, what's your next project now after Alan's success?
(02:06:31)<jomiolto>I actually like coding in assembler, but sadly it is about as far from portable as possible
(02:06:37)<Glowie>Hehe
(02:07:45)<jomiolto>Glowie: well, I'll continue working on my roguelike library, libexador, until it's ready for my next game, Dungeon of the Undead
(02:08:12)<jomiolto>DotU will also be quite small for a roguelike, something about the size of the original rogue, I reckon
(02:08:30)<Glowie>Will there be rotting flesh and yellowish bones?
(02:08:45)<jomiolto>perhaps in the tile graphics version :)
(02:09:19)<Glowie>Yay
(02:09:47)<jomiolto>DotU was actually my original distraction from the bigger roguelike I'm working on, Shadows of Exador
(02:10:24)<Glowie>The Exador screen I found seemed influenced by ADOM :P
(02:10:26)<jomiolto>... which in turn is something I want to get done before starting to really work on my dream roguelike :)
(02:10:33)<Glowie>Haha
(02:10:36)<Glowie>Vaporware after vaporware
(02:10:41)<jomiolto>Glowie: it is and very heavily so
(02:10:46)<jomiolto>at least in some respects
(02:12:23)<joe6pack>i haven't had a "dream roguelike"  in years
(02:13:11)<Glowie>You realized it's impossible to make it true?
(02:13:20)<joe6pack>yes
(02:13:23)<jomiolto>:(
(02:13:35)<joe6pack>at least it was at the time...
(02:13:38)<jomiolto>nanananana, I do not hear you, nanananana!
(02:13:43)<jomiolto>:)
(02:13:45)<joe6pack>i am a much better programmer now
(02:14:17)<joe6pack>but i think i prefer a series of 7drl's...
(02:14:40)<joe6pack>real life interfering with my game programming again
(02:15:00)<joe6pack>but i'm glad i did the 7drl this year. i think i will do another one next year
(02:17:59)<jomiolto>hmm, that cryptrover yours?
(02:18:09)<joe6pack>yes
(02:18:10)<jomiolto>seems interesting, I think I'll try it out
(02:18:19)<joe6pack>try the current versiopn
(02:18:47)<joe6pack>it has some fixes and extrsa features that the 7drl version didn't have 
(02:19:10)<jomiolto>well, I might try both of them actually
(02:19:36)<joe6pack>do you have svn installed?
(02:19:40)<jomiolto>but the 7day version is the one that interests me more (unless it has some crashing bugs?)
(02:19:46)<joe6pack>no,
(02:19:49)<jomiolto>yeah, I do
(02:19:53)<joe6pack>just minot bugs
(02:19:57)<joe6pack>"minor"
(02:20:04)<joe6pack>and 1 feature less
(02:20:13)<joe6pack>and is too easy :p
(02:20:39)<joe6pack>why is the 7drl version more interesting? 
(02:20:56)<joe6pack>current: svn checkout http://cryptrover.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cryptrover
(02:21:00)<jomiolto>because it's made in 7 days :P
(02:21:15)<joe6pack>7drl: http://code.google.com/p/cryptrover/downloads/list
(02:21:48)<jomiolto>yeah, I already have the code and I compiled the game, I just a bit distracted by the source
(02:22:08)<joe6pack>how come?
(02:22:20)<jomiolto>well, I don't know, I just had to see it :)
(02:22:42)<joe6pack>i think the 7drl source is probably easier to understand though 
(02:23:18)<joe6pack>"proper" keyboard handleing isn't that easy 
(02:25:51)<jomiolto>oops, I was surrounded by monsters when I started, didn't survive very long :(
(02:26:10)<joe6pack>that's another thing that's been corrected in the current version
(02:26:20)<joe6pack>i think i will release it as the 1.0 version
(02:26:46)<joe6pack>but i'll sit on it till may 1st, make it a round 3 months between the 7drl version and 1.0
(02:27:23)<joe6pack>even though i haven't developed it at all after about ~1.5 weeks after the 7drl version
(02:27:49)<joe6pack>just in case something pops up...
(02:28:00)<joe6pack>and then i will leave it be forever 
(02:28:00)<jomiolto>hmm, I like the idea and the game seems really nice
(02:28:09)<joe6pack>thank you 
(02:28:52)<jomiolto>I don't know about too easy, though, I guess I'm really lousy player, since I died again :P
(02:28:59)<jomiolto>ran out of air
(02:29:02)<joe6pack>in the 7drl version?
(02:29:05)<jomiolto>yeah
(02:29:30)<joe6pack>well some guys on rgrm said it was too easy, take what you will out of that ;0
(02:29:43)<joe6pack>that was meant to be a ;)
(02:30:13)<joe6pack>i don't think the people who frequent rgrm are "normal" palyers
(02:31:25)<joe6pack>hey
(02:31:34)<joe6pack>now that i look at the downloads section
(02:31:48)<jomiolto>agh, I don't seem to get past level 5
(02:32:19)<joe6pack>glowie's hall of fame screenshot is from only 8 days after the 7drl release, and that one had pretty much everything in it 
(02:32:39)<joe6pack>i thought it took longer than taht 
(02:33:44)<jomiolto>are the later release(s) more difficult than the 7drl version?
(02:33:57)<joe6pack>i think they might be a bit more difficult 
(02:34:04)<jomiolto>oh, no :P
(02:34:11)<joe6pack>but you can just give yourself a bit more hp and air
(02:34:19)<jomiolto>heh
(02:34:24)<joe6pack>there is a #define AIR ...
(02:34:26)<joe6pack>somewhere
(02:35:31)<joe6pack>look at items.h
(02:35:41)<joe6pack>and change these lines at the top:
(02:35:46)<joe6pack>#define MED_CHARGE 3
(02:35:46)<joe6pack>#define AIR_CHARGE 21
(02:35:46)<joe6pack>#define BATTERY_CHARGE 34

(02:35:46)<joe6pack>#define AIR_NUM 4
(02:35:49)<joe6pack>#define BATTERY_NUM 3
(02:36:15)<jomiolto>nah, I'll just try to beat it fairly :)
(02:36:22)<joe6pack>the first 3 control how much each pack gives you and the last 3 how many of them there are at each level

(04:24:04)<RotateMe>hi, joe6bot
(04:24:13)<RotateMe>randomquote
(04:24:13)<null>crack: <DaEezT> Cracks and Crevices sounds liek a porn movie
(04:24:26)<oeb>RotateMe, no, I drink =P
(04:25:04)<RotateMe>well than that's no difference to uni life (aside from the fact that there are very few real "pubs" in germany)
(04:25:15)<oeb>I skipped the whole uni thing and worked out fine. That being said I would be unlikely to hire someone without a degree, unless their portfolio really impressed me of course
(04:25:29)<oeb>RotateMe, Well I also get paid.
(04:25:37)<oeb>(Not for drinking)
(04:25:52)<RotateMe>striptease? =)
(04:26:01)<oeb>Something like that =P
(04:26:15)<joe6pack>RotateMe: what? there are a ton of pubs in germany 
(04:26:20)<oeb>I head up a PHP dev team in Ireland. I drink in my spare time.
(04:26:33)<RotateMe>it's called bars here
(04:26:39)<oeb>I know a few lads who went to germany for 6 months to study, and they did not leave the pub.
(04:26:42)<joe6pack>same thing
(04:26:43)<oeb>pub === bar
(04:27:00)<oeb>In ireland anyway the words are interchangable.
(04:27:26)<RotateMe>well we have pubs who especially address irish (and for some reason american and english) people
(04:27:52)<joe6pack>in canada a pub is where you'd go with other guys to watch a hockey match and a bar is where you'd go to find women
(04:27:53)<RotateMe>if it's the same thing, i agree, we have tons here
(04:28:15)<RotateMe>i live in heidelberg, it's got the most bars in one street in the whole friggin world
(04:28:21)<RotateMe>(unproven fact)
(04:28:44)<joe6pack>heh
(04:29:02)<joe6pack>i have heard this "fact" said about many, many cities
(04:29:06)<oeb>In Ireland a pub club bar or boozer is a place that serves alcohol, may serve food.
(04:29:14)<RotateMe>well it's also the longest pedestrian zone in europe so that's not such a great fact
(04:29:39)<oeb>You can pick up women anywhere, easier at night though rather than sunday afternoon when they are sitting down for lunch with their parents.
(04:29:41)<joe6pack>i would also take that one with a grain of salt 
(04:30:01)<RotateMe>what i hate is clubs
(04:30:20)<RotateMe>at least, again, the german definition of it
(04:30:36)<oeb>Most clubs here tend to have a bar at the front and a disco / nightclub at the back.
(04:30:44)<oeb>That's different in the cities though.
(04:30:54)<RotateMe>a place where you have to pay to get in, to get even more expensive drinks, get looked at because you're wearing a pullover instead of something stylish
(04:31:23)<RotateMe>and probably get thrown out when you drink too much
(04:31:24)<joe6pack>i have stopped going to clubs a long time ago
(04:32:02)<RotateMe>if i have to pay to get in and there's no good live musiv it's a no go area for me too
(04:32:12)<RotateMe>*music
(04:33:22)<RotateMe>and bars/pubs are not as good as they've been when you were allowed to smoke inside :(
(04:34:03)<joe6pack>hah
(04:34:12)<joe6pack>in vienna nobody gives a shit about that law
(04:34:41)<joe6pack>that's part of the reason i hate going out here. i always come back stinking of cigarette smoke
(04:34:52)<oeb>I don't pay to go into any clubs around here =P
(04:35:16)<oeb>(I worked as a doorman for a few years)
(04:37:10)<RotateMe>the prices for drinks suck in most clubs though
(04:37:15)<RotateMe>and the drinks themselves

(09:15:07)<ido>anyone know of a sort of tutorial on how to program telnet applications like crawl/nethack's public server?
(09:32:59)<oeb>Earthquakes in England last night. 4.5 on the scale!
(09:33:51)<joe6pack>4.5 is nothing 
(09:33:56)<DaEezT>i read something about 5.3
(09:34:11)<joe6pack>that's also not really noteworthy 
(09:35:09)<joe6pack>Earthquakes get interesting when buildings collapse and/or people are dieing 
(09:39:02)<oeb>It's something for England

(04:26:53)<joe6pack>what's up?
(04:28:32)<Aerton>ido> anyone know of a sort of tutorial on how to program telnet applications like crawl/nethack's public server?
(04:28:46)<Aerton>funny coicendence :)
(04:28:46)<joe6pack>Aerton: indeed
(04:28:50)<joe6pack>why?
(04:29:14)<joe6pack>i was thinking of posting the quesetion to the newsgroup 
(04:29:16)<Aerton>there is one in development for 2 days :)
(04:29:22)<joe6pack>by you?
(04:29:26)<Aerton>yes
(04:29:31)<joe6pack>:)
(04:29:50)<joe6pack>then maybe you can write a tutorial of sorts...
(04:30:03)<joe6pack>how's it going? easy? difficult?
(04:30:42)<Aerton>easier, if you are familiar with unix system programming
(04:30:49)<joe6pack>ok
(04:31:02)<joe6pack>which language are you developing it in?
(04:31:07)<Aerton>C
(04:31:11)<joe6pack>great
(04:31:29)<joe6pack>then maybe i can take a look at your system
(04:31:46)<joe6pack>(after i finish studying to all my exams) 
(04:31:59)<Aerton>:)
(04:32:09)<Aerton>is there a lot of them left?
(04:32:16)<joe6pack>yes :(
(04:32:25)<joe6pack>it will be a while
(04:32:51)<joe6pack>and i will also have quite a few courses in the coming semester
(04:33:01)<joe6pack>so until the summer i will not have a lot of free time
(04:33:26)<Aerton>I *hope* to get at least something of prototype-quality before 7DRL 2008
(04:33:37)<joe6pack>ok
(04:33:43)<joe6pack>good
(04:33:54)<joe6pack>i will now go back to learning 
(06:36:48)<deveah>hello
(06:43:42)<ido_>Aerton: ftp://ftp.alt.org/pub/dgamelaunch/
(06:44:11)<ido_>it can actually be used to start any game
(06:44:36)<ido_>there is nothing nethack specific there
(06:44:46)<ido_>or the README says
(06:48:04)<ido_studying>quote telnet, ftp://ftp.alt.org/pub/dgamelaunch/
(06:48:16)<ido_studying>getquote telnet
(06:48:16)<null>telnet(0):  ftp://ftp.alt.org/pub/dgamelaunch/
(07:03:06)<Glowie>Yeah it can, but it's not guaranteed to work with all games
(07:03:49)<Glowie>I spent one day fiddling with it with Napkin (he runs a Crawl server and wants to add more games), but we couldn't get watching to work with Frozen Depths. Most likely a ttyrec problem after a lot of experimenting
(07:03:57)<Glowie>Aerton is able to fix that :P
(07:06:51)<ido_studying>ttyrec?
(07:07:11)<Glowie>A program that records console
(07:07:17)<Glowie>For example roguelikes
(07:07:24)<joe6pack>oh ok
(07:07:35)<Glowie>DGameLaunch uses it to provide the watching feed for people
(07:08:17)<joe6pack>why would it work differently with fd? if it's just a normal curses program
(07:08:38)<Glowie>I have no idea
(07:09:06)<Glowie>It misdrew parts of the screen
(07:09:08)<Glowie>Very weird stuff
(07:09:22)<joe6pack>strange 
(07:12:21)<joe6pack>well dgl uses curses itself. maybe it setups some options in a way that fd didn't expect? 
(07:12:29)<Glowie>Perhaps Aerton's thingie will support all roguelikes
(07:12:42)<Glowie>But it's not DGL, it's ttyrec
(07:12:50)<Glowie>Playing the game worked fine
(07:12:52)<Epyon_>S*** telnet server lol
(07:12:52)<Glowie>But not watching
(07:13:19)<Glowie>We even tried with just ttyrec and it screwed the video too
(07:13:27)<joe6pack>hrm
(07:13:37)<joe6pack>so the problem isn't dgl
(07:13:50)<Glowie>Indirectly I'd say :P
(07:13:53)<Glowie>DGL uses ttyrec
(07:13:56)<Glowie>So it's both of their problem
(07:15:31)<joe6pack>he will have to write or find an alternative for ttyrec then
(07:16:00)<joe6pack>and if he does maybe the dgl can be used with that... oh well
(07:16:08)<joe6pack>we'll see what he comes up with
(07:16:43)<Glowie>He has written a watching telnet program once already
(07:16:55)<joe6pack>link?
(07:16:58)<Glowie>So he'll write an alternative, but most likely an integrated one so it can't be used with it
(07:17:14)<Glowie>Unfortunately it was only for our private use and isn't online
(07:17:21)<Glowie>The sources might be on Aerton's old computer still

(10:11:49)<joe6pack>just finished 3 games of warcraft 3. it's been quite some time since i've played that game regularly 
(10:11:58)<joe6pack>i won every match :)
(10:12:19)<kinnala>I used to play c&c:generals a lot
(10:12:24)<joe6pack>but i was palying against total novices 
(10:12:25)<kinnala>it was a fun game to play with friends
(10:12:38)<kinnala>got wc3 also
(10:13:01)<joe6pack>are you good at it?
(10:13:09)<kinnala>no :-D
(10:13:21)<joe6pack>did you play on battle.net?
(10:13:29)<kinnala>few times
(10:13:42)<joe6pack>it's not an easy game to master

(10:14:20)<kinnala>you lose much in the beginning

(10:14:43)<kinnala>just like every 1on1 game
(10:14:49)<joe6pack>i'm not that good at it either, but i am at least at a level where i don't lose all the time
(10:15:08)<joe6pack>you can play teams though, easier to learn i guess
(10:16:14)<joe6pack>and every race is also totally different; i can play alright with the humans, elves and orcs but i almost haven't played the undead at all

(05:30:36)<ido>i just sent an email to this girl, asking if she wants to watch the new coen brothers film
(05:30:43)<ido>i hope she does
(05:31:44)<ido>nothing motivates one to find a new girlfriend like finding out one's ex has a new boyfriend 
(05:38:50)<oeb>New Coen bros film kicks ass
(05:39:01)<ido>so i have heard
(05:39:08)<oeb>Although I took two girls to see it and neither one 'got' it. So beware.
(05:39:30)<jraregris>high five!
(05:39:46)<oeb>I ment the movie. They did get the other thing.
(05:39:52)<ido>well i think this one is different 
(05:40:05)<ido>she liked fight club 
(05:40:08)<oeb>It's quite abstract.
(05:40:18)<ido>i don't know any other girl who liked fight club
(05:41:40)<oeb>I know a couple.
(05:42:34)<ido>well we'll see 
(05:42:40)<oeb>Sitting in the cinema after the movie finished was funny though. Nearly every couple in there had one person going 'That was the best movie ever' and another going 'What the fuck was that about? That makes no bloody sense!'
(05:42:54)<ido>haha
(05:43:05)<ido>so it will also double as an iq test 
(05:43:07)<oeb>Read the book too. Cormac McCarthy is a good writer.
(05:43:22)<ido>to see if i should try to go any further with her
(05:43:22)<oeb>It's not IQ, it just requires kinda abstract thinking.
(05:43:46)<ido>the trailer didn't seem so abstract 
(05:43:57)<ido>just some guy going on a killing rampage 
(05:44:03)<oeb>It does not start off abstract.
(05:44:19)<oeb>It's the ending is a bit of a mind fuck. It's what the charachters represent.
(05:44:25)<ido>ok
(05:44:36)<oeb>It's the conclusion of the story that really sours it for people that did not get it.
(05:44:46)<ido>let's not talk about it anymore
(05:44:54)<oeb>Ohh no spoilers from me.
(05:45:04)<ido>:)
(05:45:18)<ido>i still rather be as surprised as possible 
(05:45:22)<oeb>Also, if you like reading, also try 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy. Very good book.

(06:01:51)<jraregris>are any of you aware of any form of documentation on jcurses (apart from the javadoc)?
(06:04:46)<RotateMe>sry can't help you there :(
(06:09:50)<jraregris>i think I'll move away from the `urge' to make my game dgamelaunch-compatible, at least for now, and rather do a pseudo-ascii thing like DF or something
(06:10:48)<Aerton>I think curses for java were discussed more the once on rgrd
(06:13:35)<ido>they were
(06:13:54)<ido>there isn't a really good platform independent way to do it
(06:15:45)<Aerton>:(
(06:16:28)<ido>i would write my own wrapper around curses and provide a windows and linux binary with the java classes
(06:27:13)<jraregris>that's pretty much what jcurses does, i guess. and i might come around to it some time, but just now I'd rather make a roguelike than a library wrapper iykwim
(06:27:33)<ido>yes
(06:27:52)<ido>i want to give swig a try some day
(06:28:00)<ido>but i never seem to get to ti

(06:37:43)<jraregris>yeah, swing has all the documentation jcurses doesn't have times a million
(06:39:32)<ido>yes, it seems to be very well documented and comes highly recommended 
(06:39:43)<ido>oh

(11:09:57)<ido>morning Numeron 
(11:15:07)<Numeron>heya
(11:18:03)<Numeron>im having trouble getting a return string from an array of mobiles(superclass for all npcs), looks like: town.mobile[x][y].name  returns nothing or crashes, whereas getting health or anything other than a string seems to work fine :S
(11:18:31)<joe6pack>are all the rest primitives?
(11:18:42)<joe6pack>like int or bool?
(11:19:09)<Numeron>yep.. there is one other string which is says, and returns a line of convo
(11:19:20)<Numeron>it doesnt work either
(11:19:23)<joe6pack>try allocation on the heap 
(11:19:29)<joe6pack>with malloc 
(11:20:36)<Numeron>never heard of this function..
(11:20:45)<joe6pack>are you programming in c?
(11:20:50)<Numeron>c++
(11:21:00)<joe6pack>it is called "new" in c++
(11:21:44)<Numeron>ive found it at www.cplusplus.com, give me 5m to play with it
(11:22:44)<joe6pack>i think malloc is supposidly not "good c++" or something.
(11:22:50)<joe6pack>but i don't know
(11:23:01)<joe6pack>i can tell you how i would have done it in c :)
(11:25:10)<Numeron>"good" or "bad" c++ doesnt worry me much... i cant seem to understand how it works anyway though :\ its used in my mobile class...?
(11:25:28)<joe6pack>how the "new" keyword works?
(11:25:39)<Numeron>oh i know how that works
(11:25:47)<Numeron>ahh i get you
(11:26:04)<Numeron>i thought you meant it was new to c++
(11:26:20)<joe6pack>:)
(11:26:50)<joe6pack>http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/dynamic.html
(11:34:26)<joe6pack>did you figure it out or is it still not working?
(11:35:14)<Numeron>havent been able to get it :(
(11:38:33)<joe6pack>paste the line where you define your string
(11:38:43)<joe6pack>and the line where you put something in it
(11:40:46)<Numeron>string name;//public global     name = "No name";//inside constructor
(11:41:13)<joe6pack>i guess "string" is from the STL or something?
(11:41:29)<Numeron>using namespace std yeah
(11:41:31)<joe6pack>because i haven't used that in a _long_ while...
(11:42:55)<joe6pack>i can tell you how i would do it with char*, which is the c wawy of doing it 
(11:43:09)<Numeron>do, ill try it
(11:43:21)<joe6pack>but maybe someone who knows c++ can help?
(11:45:36)<Numeron>...i might set up some accessor methods and see if i can pinpoint where the f up happens
(11:47:02)<joe6pack>it happens when you leave the function scope and the stack is trashed
(11:47:10)<joe6pack>give me a min i'll write an example
(11:50:39)<joe6pack>char ** some_function(){
(11:50:43)<joe6pack>	char** str= malloc(sizeof(char)*50 );
(11:50:43)<joe6pack>	*str="1234\n";
(11:50:43)<joe6pack>	return str;
(11:50:43)<joe6pack>}
(11:50:51)<joe6pack>main(){ printf(*some_function());
(11:50:52)<joe6pack>}
(11:51:33)<joe6pack>that way the content of the string is not trashed after you leave the function some_function()
(11:52:29)<Numeron>i cant define anything in the global scope without it being static though can i?
(11:52:43)<joe6pack>?
(11:53:10)<joe6pack>of course you can define pointers in the global scope
(11:53:48)<joe6pack>you just don't allocate the memory in the global scope
(11:54:55)<Numeron>hmm. ill see what i can do
(11:55:26)<joe6pack>char **str;
(11:55:26)<joe6pack>void some_function(){ str= malloc(sizeof(char)*50 ); *str="1234\n";
(11:55:32)<joe6pack>}
(11:55:57)<joe6pack>dammit why does it paste it in such a crappy way
(11:56:08)<joe6pack>char **str;
(11:56:10)<joe6pack>void some_function(){
(11:56:13)<joe6pack>    str= malloc(sizeof(char)*50 );
(11:56:17)<joe6pack>    *str="1234\n";
(11:56:20)<joe6pack>}
(11:56:26)<joe6pack>main(){
(11:56:28)<joe6pack>    some_function();
(11:56:30)<joe6pack>    printf(*str);
(11:56:34)<joe6pack>}
(11:56:48)<joe6pack>in that case str is in the global scope
(11:58:06)<Numeron>i see
(11:58:59)<Numeron>i have:
(11:59:08)<Numeron>uh hang on
(11:59:19)<joe6pack>maybe give a link instead
(12:00:20)<Numeron>name = malloc(sizeof(char)*50 );
(12:00:26)<Numeron>*name = "Default";
(12:00:42)<joe6pack>yes
(12:00:45)<Numeron>gives compiler error: 
(12:00:46)<Numeron>ambiguous overload for 'operator=' in '((Mobile*)this)->Mobile::name = malloc(50u)' 
(12:01:10)<joe6pack>what is the type of name?
(12:01:24)<joe6pack>should be "char **name;"
(12:01:46)<Numeron>ah
(12:02:15)<joe6pack>again, this is the c way of doing things. if you want to use the stl this is not the way to go
(12:02:36)<Numeron>name = malloc(sizeof(char)*50 ); is invalid conversion from void* to char** :(
(12:03:45)<joe6pack>oh yea
(12:04:04)<Numeron>i think i might jsut continue to shotgun program it for a while... ahh something so seemingly trivial after the awesomeness of getting walls in lit rooms to light up when viewed from the lit side but stay dark otherwise :(
(12:04:20)<joe6pack>there was a bug in my code
(12:05:59)<joe6pack>try with 1 star
(12:06:05)<joe6pack>char *str;
(12:06:08)<joe6pack>void some_function(){
(12:06:12)<joe6pack>    str= malloc(sizeof(char)*50 );
(12:06:17)<joe6pack>    *str="1234\n";
(12:06:21)<joe6pack>}
(12:06:52)<joe6pack>anyway
(12:07:24)<joe6pack> you should find out how to do this with new and and string, since this is the way it probably should be done in c++
(12:08:16)<Numeron>invalid from void* to char*, i will try to get it with new
(12:08:29)<joe6pack>oh wait what am i writing...
(12:13:12)<joe6pack>char *str;
(12:13:15)<joe6pack>void some_function(){
(12:13:19)<joe6pack>    str= malloc(sizeof(char)*50 );
(12:13:22)<joe6pack>    strcpy(str,"1234\n");
(12:13:25)<joe6pack>}
(12:14:19)<joe6pack>damn have to start studying :(
(12:14:25)<joe6pack>have a nice day
(12:14:28)<joe6pack>and good luck
(12:16:51)<Numeron>i think i jsut got it... by pure fluke while looking into something else i discovered that in my game.h i have Map town; and also have in the constructor Game(){ town = Map();  ...
(12:17:43)<Numeron>so it initialised town twice, making it funky for whatever reason
(12:18:11)<joe6pack>i hope you are freeing all that dynamic memory at some point ;)
(12:18:53)<joe6pack>i try to use the stack as much as possible, since it's sometimes such a pain in the ass, what with memory leaks and all
(12:19:57)<joe6pack>i am sure that if you don't know why it works now and why it didn't work before that you are doing something wrong and it will come up again in the future 
(12:20:12)<joe6pack>ideally you should understand what your program is doing 
(12:20:14)<joe6pack>which is
(12:20:20)<joe6pack>incedentally 
(12:20:27)<joe6pack>the reason why i don't program in c++ :)
(12:20:36)<Numeron>you are absoluetly correct. thanks for your help though, 'tis appreciated
(12:20:44)<joe6pack>no problem
(12:20:56)<Numeron>i got a job yesterday with fujitsu working with java, so i wont have that problem anyway
(12:21:10)<Numeron>im excited. first job of my career
(12:21:14)<joe6pack>with all that buggy code i pasted here, wasn't that helpfull...
(12:21:34)<joe6pack>is it a c++ job?
(12:21:55)<Numeron>java and the oh so not sexy plsql
(12:22:18)<joe6pack>well you will at least not have these problems in java :0
(12:22:37)<Numeron>yeah i know, go team garbage collector :P
(12:22:38)<joe6pack>everything is on the heap anyway 
(12:22:51)<joe6pack>oh yea, and you don't have to free it yourself...
(12:24:01)<joe6pack>i blame my problems with memory allocation to the fact that almost all of my experience comes from using java and python 
(12:24:08)<joe6pack>that's why i started getting into c,
(12:24:35)<joe6pack>you have to learn these things sometime. and you won't learn it from java, python or scheme
(12:24:36)<Numeron>c is pretty hard edge with memory hey?
(12:24:55)<joe6pack>same as c++, as far as i can tell
(12:25:12)<joe6pack>in c++ you just use new and delete instead of malloc and free
(12:26:17)<Numeron>at uni i was taught java, and half way through my course everything switched over to c++ and i had to learn it on the fly while being taught advanced programming techniques... so most things to do with memory are pretty much beyond me
(12:26:19)<joe6pack>i think cryptrover was the 2nd "real" c program that i've written 
(12:26:55)<joe6pack>yea it was the same way for me. but since cs is not my major i only did c and c++ in 1 course
(12:27:23)<joe6pack>so i try to learn it myself by programming rougelikes in c :)
(12:27:56)<Numeron>its a good way, especially with small disposable rls like the 7day ones
(12:28:02)<joe6pack>yes
(12:28:20)<Numeron>are you still working on cryptrover btw?
(12:28:36)<joe6pack>as basic as my c skills are now, they are leaps and bounds better developed than they were before i did cryptrover 
(12:28:39)<joe6pack>no
(12:28:46)<joe6pack>haven't touched it in a while
(12:29:08)<Numeron>fair enough.
(12:29:39)<joe6pack>i think i'll leave it as it is. simple and small
(12:31:30)<Numeron>aye. ive not touched crown, but then again im working on a large scale version atm anyway lol
(12:32:28)<joe6pack_studyi>hoping the nick will make me actually start studying for my exam :O
(12:32:41)<hopbot>PEOPLE
(12:33:01)<hopbot>oh man
(12:33:08)<hopbot>semester starts in 2 days
(12:33:52)<hopbot>I have to find my bag and pencil case, get supplies, find out about the buses, buy text and course books, pay the fees, start waking up 5 hours earlier, etc, etc :(
(12:34:37)<Numeron>you'll be right, first week is all plaigarism statements and "this is what you're going to learn" and rubbish like that
(12:34:55)<hopbot>not in my experience
(12:35:10)<hopbot>normally they do that for between 5 minutes and one lecture
(12:36:27)<Numeron>i guess. im usually pretty lax during my first week :P
(12:36:40)<hopbot>well me too
(12:37:04)<hopbot>but I haven't prepared in the slightest, and I'm busy with things this weekend

(05:01:22)<jomiolto>so, I guess I'll just drink as usual (not that I'm already drunk...)
(05:02:02)<oeb>It's ok, I only sobered up about 4 hours ago. And I have been at work for 7.
(05:02:24)<jomiolto>I've been drinkin almost the whole day, and I'm only getting drunk just now ;)
(05:02:38)<jomiolto>j√§germeister is a good medicin for sore throat
(05:02:40)<oeb>What time zone are you in?
(05:02:41)<jomiolto>:)
(05:02:56)<jomiolto>oeb: Finland
(05:03:04)<oeb>What's that? GMT+2?
(05:03:07)<jomiolto>UTC+2 or +3, don't remember :/
(05:03:15)<DaEezT>too drunk already :D
(05:03:17)<oeb>It's 16.11 here now.
(05:03:24)<DaEezT>17:09 here
(05:03:30)<jomiolto>18:11 here now
(05:03:38)<oeb>Ohh ok, 2 ahead.
(05:03:55)<oeb>I wanna go on the beer again tonight! I'll have to wait till tomorrow though.
(05:04:09)<oeb>Guess I'll have to go back to fucking around with SVG tonight.
(05:04:09)<jomiolto>why?
(05:04:22)<oeb>I have my son on Friday nights.
(05:04:35)<jomiolto>SVG=vector gra√•hics, or something else?
(05:04:44)<oeb>Vector Graphics.
(05:04:47)<jomiolto>ok
(05:05:04)<oeb>Writing a graphing / Charting thing with PHP / Javascript.
(05:05:30)<jomiolto>:/
(05:05:38)<jomiolto>work or something else?
(05:06:10)<jomiolto>I'm personlly setting up Gentoo system for my home server ;)
(05:06:24)<oeb>Doing it for the hell of it.
(05:06:33)<oeb>Never used SVG with Javascript before.
(05:06:33)<jomiolto>hah :)
(05:06:47)<oeb>I'll probably find something to do with it for work though.
(05:08:09)<DaEezT>gentoo for home servers 4t2 \o/
(05:08:12)<DaEezT>4tw
(05:08:13)<DaEezT>D:
(05:08:14)<jomiolto>hmm, I should work on my roguelike library, but I think I'm too drunk :(
(05:09:35)<jomiolto>btw, anyone using source management system with their roguelikes/other projects?
(05:09:55)<DaEezT>we use svn at work
(05:09:56)<jomiolto>t I'm asking because I just set up git on my home server :)
(05:10:09)<jomiolto>never use any system before...
(05:10:13)<DaEezT>used to use cvs at uni
(05:10:21)<cakeboy>i use git a lot
(05:10:22)<jomiolto>always done backups, etc. by myself...
(05:10:27)<cakeboy>git is super
(05:10:36)<oeb>I dont use any source control or backups. I walk on the wild side.
(05:10:37)<jomiolto>git seems nice from the little I've used it
(05:10:39)<cakeboy>and actually really easy to use
(05:10:51)<oeb>Vodka and Pocket Protectors Baby!
(05:11:08)<jomiolto>It was even quite easy to set up, once I got past the initial difficulties
(05:11:24)<jomiolto>now I'll just see if it actually works fpr me
(05:12:05)<oeb>Does Git have decent windows clients? I have been meaning to set up source control on the ubuntu server at my feet for ages
(05:12:26)<jomiolto>the problem with doing the backups by myself is the fact that I might require different versions for different applications (for example Alan's Journey will require one that has exactly the same interface as the current version)
(05:12:49)<jomiolto>oeb: I don't know about windows clients rally, since I use Linux only :/
(05:13:00)<jomiolto>but I think there is supposed to be a windows port
(05:13:15)<oeb>Main work machines are windows =(
(05:13:50)<jomiolto>:(
(05:14:08)<cakeboy>oeb: yes
(05:14:24)<cakeboy>to actually push and pull with it might be hard, because you need an rsa keygen
(05:14:34)<cakeboy>and for some reason my windows one wouldn't generate proper keys
(05:14:51)<cakeboy>but it's real easy to check out and all that
(05:15:23)<jomiolto>well, I have a ssh thing setup already, so the rsa stuff is already setup ;)
(05:15:40)<jomiolto>All I need for a push is passwd/username
(05:41:59)<DaEezT>oeb really knows how to kill a conversation
(05:42:06)<DaEezT>arg
(05:42:07)<DaEezT>lol

(12:07:02)<jraregris>Yeah, that's close enough
(12:07:06)<jraregris>o/
(12:13:58)<Glowie>What's up? :P
(12:20:50)<jraregris>never mind me. I'm just over tired as we say in norwegian
(12:21:13)<Glowie>Okay
(12:21:46)<jraregris>I've had all week to lay out a magazine in InDesign, and i never really get started until its almost too late
(12:22:20)<jraregris>I've got procrastination problems
(12:23:08)<jraregris>so now I've been marking up word-documents and laying up for 14 hours straight
(12:24:16)<Glowie>:P
(12:27:14)<jraregris>it's usually when I've got something important work hovering over me that i get productive on all the 'everyday projects' I always intend on doing, but never seem to get around to
(12:28:17)<jraregris>like last night me and a friend made a php-script that helps you out on an ethical level
(12:29:24)<Glowie>Substitute work to replace the real work you'd have to do?
(12:29:29)<jraregris>if you're at a party and appear to be getting lucky with a girl, but she seems a bit young, and you're not all certain on if it's morally 'right' to have sexing with her
(12:29:35)<jraregris>yeah
(12:30:00)<jraregris>anyways, you enter your age and her age, and the script tells you to go ahead or let her be
(12:30:18)<jraregris>it works for girls too
(12:31:07)<Glowie>Haha
(12:31:12)<Glowie>And if the girl lies her age?
(12:31:57)<jraregris>our php has no way of telling lies from truth at this moment
(12:32:21)<Glowie>:P
(12:32:32)<jraregris>maybe we could add a credit card check up or something
(12:33:24)<jraregris>maybe we ought to implement a quiz to determine the age (like in leisure suit larry)
(12:33:54)<Glowie>Haha
(12:34:05)<Glowie>I remember guessing the questions when I was a kid
(12:39:59)<jraregris>me too
(12:40:44)<jraregris>and whene me and a mate played cannon fodder, we knew one of the possible key words (from the manual) and started the game about 50 times to get through

(11:30:48)<joe6pack>me neither 
(11:30:54)<joe6pack>but i liked it
(11:32:04)<joe6pack>anyone played Mines of Elderlore ?
(11:32:08)<deveah>nah
(11:33:55)<joe6pack>not providing an executable or requiring anything but standard gnu built tools to build seems like the best way to have no one play your game
(11:35:13)<joe6pack>oh i see he has an executable there now
(11:36:04)<joe6pack>heh readme.txt is the only file flaged as a binary... 
(11:37:18)<joe6pack>bugs
(11:37:31)<joe6pack>i get &/ as the player
(11:37:51)<joe6pack>and all the other tiles/chars are also 2 chars wide
(11:37:53)<TeeEmCee>what's wrong with only requiring standard gnu tools?
(11:38:02)<joe6pack>nothing
(11:38:03)<TeeEmCee>oh, I think I misread
(11:38:39)<TeeEmCee>what else did the author require?
(11:38:50)<joe6pack>actually requiring python is also ok. but numeric is normally not installed by default
(11:39:10)<joe6pack>i mean it's not that bad, it's the only thing i had to install
(11:40:41)<joe6pack>but he also didn't flag the right files as executables. had he not needed numeric, added a correct shebang and flaged moe.py as executable i wouldn't have even needed to know it's a python program
(11:40:46)<TeeEmCee>numeric is required by pygame, isn't it
(11:40:53)<joe6pack>would have just run it as a normal program
(11:40:57)<joe6pack>yes
(11:41:02)<joe6pack>but he didn't use pygame 
(11:41:16)<joe6pack>that's not required, just numeric 
(11:41:26)<joe6pack>which again, is not that terrible 
(11:41:57)<joe6pack>but i'm just saying, have as few barriers to compilation as possible 
(11:42:37)<joe6pack>a lot of times i wouldn't even bother twice with a game requiring anything more than "make" or "./configure && make"
(11:42:48)<joe6pack>unless i know in advance it's worth it
(11:43:40)<TeeEmCee>yikse!
(11:43:52)<TeeEmCee>I screwed up my timetabler
(11:44:01)<TeeEmCee>*timetablle
(11:44:04)<TeeEmCee>damn cat
(11:44:08)<joe6pack>:)
(11:44:40)<joe6pack>i really liked tinypy 
(11:44:53)<joe6pack>the vm is so small you can bundle it with your game
(11:45:19)<joe6pack>and really only be dependent on a c compiler and standard libs 
(11:48:16)<TeeEmCee>tinypy?
(11:48:37)<TeeEmCee>stripped down version of python, or a reimplementation?
(11:48:44)<TeeEmCee>I need sleep and stuff
(11:48:55)<joe6pack>reimplementation
(11:48:59)<TeeEmCee>I'll sort out my timetable mishap some other day
(11:49:02)<TeeEmCee>oh really?
(11:49:11)<joe6pack>yea
(11:49:14)<joe6pack>very small
(11:49:17)<TeeEmCee>interesting, I didn't know there was more than one python implementation
(11:49:26)<joe6pack>there are a lot of themn
(11:49:42)<joe6pack>jython, pypy, cpython...
(11:49:49)<TeeEmCee>besides wacky python-to-java-bytecode ones?
(11:49:59)<joe6pack>that would be jython 
(11:50:17)<TeeEmCee>(cheating)
(11:50:22)<joe6pack>i only used the standard c implementation till now 
(11:50:31)<joe6pack>why is that cheating? 
(11:50:38)<TeeEmCee>hehe
(11:50:40)<TeeEmCee>night
(11:59:35)<joe6pack>i'm off to
(11:59:40)<joe6pack>have t ostudy

(02:58:31)<Snarius>there could still be some artifact, but there could be a lot more to explore
(03:01:18)<_df_>well people complain with really big maps.. i dont know if players would like infinite sized maps.
(03:02:12)<_df_>people like constrained maps, fixed size type things that they can explore. they dont like.. infinite :)
(03:02:51)<Snarius>I just had an idea a while ago for a 'staff of passage'
(03:03:12)<Snarius>it would make a tunnel or portal to a different dungeon branch
(03:03:26)<Snarius>is it just me, or does that sound really neat?
(03:27:56)<_df_>code it and see if its good to play
(07:19:05)<TeeEmCee>hello
(07:19:12)<TeeEmCee>RL DEVELOPER POLL
(07:19:24)<TeeEmCee>does a game need permadeath to be a RL?
(07:19:50)<TeeEmCee>I think it's not totally necessary
(07:20:38)<TeeEmCee>there are often rl's on At Play with some sort of 'continue from last town with lost equipment' feature
(07:52:13)<Numeron>i dont think so. for me a roguelike is simply rogue-like. if its like rogue in some way then it passes the bar, but it doesnt have to be in every way
(07:52:52)<Numeron>permadeath is a good idea though
(07:53:04)<TeeEmCee>normally
(07:53:20)<TeeEmCee>well, for a traditional roguelike anyway
(07:53:21)<TeeEmCee>f
(07:53:37)<TeeEmCee>don't know if you count crown of the forest as a rl
(07:54:06)<Numeron>i count it as one. it has rpg features in a turn based ascii environment
(07:54:27)<TeeEmCee>but such a game shows permadeath can be replaced with other gameplay
(07:56:18)<Numeron>it does, but does that then exclude it from being a rl? my definition of a rl is very very loose
(07:56:53)<Numeron>is a rl without potions a rl?
(07:57:12)<TeeEmCee>definitely
(07:57:29)<TeeEmCee>that's easy
(07:57:45)<Numeron>then why is a rl without permadeath not a rl? permadeath is a feature jsut like potions are a feature, removing one doesnt make it any less rl
(07:57:56)<TeeEmCee>but it's possible to stray waaaay away from rogue, and still present the game the same
(07:58:16)<TeeEmCee>it seems like people care more about presentation than gameplay in their definitions
(07:58:56)<TeeEmCee>like you mentioned ascii
(08:00:28)<Numeron>well in crown, you run around, turnbased inside cells (ascii isnt important, since there are rls with tiles) casting spells, buying potions pwning other creatures, thats pretty much what a rl is: it jsut doesnt have down stairs and a different win condition
(08:01:39)<Numeron>and thats all gameplay
(08:01:58)<TeeEmCee>yeah, crown is still fairly close to rogue despite being a totally different idea
(08:02:10)<Numeron>therefore it is rogue-like
(08:02:17)<Numeron>:)
(08:02:23)<TeeEmCee>yep
(11:18:48)<ido>oeb: where you the one who told me about "no country for old men"?
(11:20:12)<oeb>Yup
(11:20:14)<oeb>Like it?
(11:20:20)<ido>it was pretty good 
(11:20:34)<ido>didn't see what was so "abstract" about it, though
(11:20:55)<oeb>Well the whole thing about yer man representing death rather than an actual villian
(11:21:12)<oeb>Especially important to see it that way to find meaning from the final scene.
(11:21:37)<oeb>Without that insight it seems like people saw no need for the crash at the end, and thought it left the movie without meaning or a clear end.
(11:22:26)<ido>do you Chigurh or Llewelyn?
(11:22:29)<oeb>People also seemed to think the movie was about the cowboy or the villian, when infact it was almost soley about the sherrif.
(11:22:43)<ido>huh
(11:22:50)<oeb>Chigurh is the villian llewelyn is the cowboy
(11:22:56)<ido>i didn't read so much meaning into it 
(11:23:01)<ido>yes i know,
(11:23:08)<ido>i asked which of them represented death
(11:23:13)<oeb>I just could not remember names.
(11:23:16)<ido>i guessed Chigurh
(11:23:19)<oeb>Yes.
(11:23:33)<oeb>The final scene shows how unstopable it is.
(11:24:07)<oeb>As in the cops could not take him, assasins could not take him, men could not take him. The car crash represents God or faith trying to stop him.
(11:24:10)<ido>i don't know. i think you are over analyzing it
(11:24:40)<oeb>I don't believe so. I think the movie has deeper meaning that it seems to have on the surface.
(11:24:56)<ido>maybe.
(11:25:00)<oeb>Speaking of movies, the new rambo movie is pretty nuts in a mindless action movie kinda way.
(11:25:37)<ido>i liked "there will be blood" much better than "no country for old men"
(11:25:48)<oeb>Don't expect an amazing story, but it's full of cool explosions, big gun fights and people getting their arms chopped off. Wrapped in enough of a story to make it watchable
(11:26:06)<ido>i don't think i'll go watch it
(11:26:34)<ido>i have been going to the cinema quite often in the past few weeks 
(11:26:40)<oeb>I have not seen there will be blood.
(11:26:42)<ido>think i've had enough for a while
(11:26:48)<ido>it's good
(11:27:03)<oeb>I go through phases of seeing movies. Had not been in about 6 months but saw 5 or six since xmas.
(11:27:17)<ido>yea i know what you mean
(11:27:40)<oeb>I Am Legend was quite good, it strayed a bit too much from the book though. By too much I mean it missed the point completley.
(11:27:43)<ido>although i don't think i often go 6 months between films
(11:27:52)<ido>it was ok
(11:28:02)<ido>didn't read the book though
(11:28:20)<oeb>Want me to spoil it? Or do you think you will read it?
(11:28:23)<ido>what was the point in the book?
(11:28:27)<ido>no i fon't 
(11:28:51)<oeb>Ok, first off in the book they were vampires rather than zombies.
(11:28:58)<ido>i have too many books in my queue to make room for a zombie apocalypse 
(11:29:23)<ido>does that make much of a difference? 
(11:29:28)<oeb>They came in two types, living vampires (Those who were alive when they got the illness) and dead ones (The already dead who rose)
(11:29:43)<oeb>Living vampires could speak and would taunt him.
(11:32:10)<oeb>In the book he was not a scientist, but an army vet who was bitten by a vampire bat many years before, hence his immunity
(11:32:35)<oeb>He went out every day and killed as many as he could, and holed up at night.
(11:33:12)<oeb>One day he finds this dog, there is a couple of chapters about his interaction with it. Very moving stuff. The dog dies.
(11:33:23)<oeb>Later he finds this woman, takes her home.
(11:33:49)<oeb>She claims to be a survivor, turns out apon a blood test that she is infected.
(11:34:45)<oeb>She reveals to him that she is part of a community of the 'living dead' people who are infected but have developed drugs to hold off the illness. They have no need to drink blood, they may go outside during the day for short periods etc.
(11:35:12)<oeb>He is a monster to them, he is the fearsome beast who kills them while they sleep.
(11:35:21)<ido>so in the book the living vampires are just normall people who need to drink blood?
(11:36:27)<oeb>There are two types, those who have succumed (They are insane etc, but can speak and show intelligence at a lower level) and the ones who are medicated who function as normall humans except for the need to sleep for at least part of the day.
(11:37:03)<oeb>When he discovers what he is and is captured by the new society, they imprision him and set him up for execution.
(11:37:07)<ido>and how do so many of them survive without the pray of normal people?
(11:37:35)<ido>do they eat one another?
(11:37:38)<oeb>The woman gives him the oppertunity to commit suicide with poision he takes them up on it.
(11:37:45)<oeb>Yes, they eat one another.
(11:38:09)<oeb>It's not explained in too much detail, but from time to time he sees them preying on one another.
(11:38:15)<oeb>Typically if one is injured.
(11:38:16)<ido>so actually their society is doomed regardless of what he does
(11:38:37)<oeb>Not really, the new society is very effeciant at killing vampires.
(11:38:57)<oeb>They do it at night when the vampires are out. He does it at day when they are asleep.
(11:38:58)<ido>newe society == the medicated vampires? 
(11:39:01)<oeb>yes
(11:39:32)<ido>but the vampires don't breed and have a limited supply of food
(11:39:39)<ido>eventually they will run out
(11:39:45)<oeb>For example when he is captured a group of 8 armed with pikes and guns easilly wipe out all the vampires outside the house.
(11:40:09)<oeb>That's not explained in too much detail, the book is set many many years after the outbreak though.
(11:40:50)<oeb>It's a short enough book, maybe 150 pages. You could read it in an afternoon easy. Well worth a read too.
(11:41:00)<ido>and can he tell the difference beteween the medicated vampires and the succmbed ones when they sleep?
(11:41:04)<oeb>No
(11:41:16)<oeb>The first he finds out about it is from the woman.
(11:42:38)<oeb>The only way he can tell if someone is infected or not is if they are out during the day. And the woman is the first one he sees outside (He does not know about the medication untill the very end).
(11:43:11)<oeb>So movie == he is a legend for curing it, book == he is a legend because he is the monster, when he thought he was the savior
(11:43:22)<ido>ok
(11:43:29)<oeb>So like I say, totally different point =P
(11:43:41)<ido>yea not really the same
(11:44:03)<oeb>It is a good book though, and like I say, nice and short, I would advise picking it up.
(11:44:35)<oeb>It's one of those 'One more chapter before I go to sleep book, Ohh shit, it's 2am already'
(11:44:43)<ido>why do people bother basing films on books when they don't keep the same story?
(11:45:22)<oeb>Well I think the Omega man, which was inspired by the book was closer to what was presented in the latest movie. Maybe it was based more on that.
(11:46:19)<oeb>There has been like 4 movie adaptations of this book. 'The last man on earth' was more faithful to the book apparently (Or so wikipedia tells me, not seen it myself)
(11:48:06)<ido>i have to go back to studying now :(
(06:18:57)<RotateMe>hey, could anybody point me to a decent c++ development enviroment for windows?
(06:27:46)<helge_>tried code blocks?
(06:29:35)<RotateMe>nope, will have a look, thx
(06:30:16)<RotateMe>looks cool
(06:30:34)<RotateMe>any experience/comparison to dev-c++ (that's the only one i know so far)
(06:36:41)<FledRebel>I use Microsoft Visual Studio for c++ dev on Windows
(06:39:26)<Glowie>Anything that compiles > Dev-Cpp
(06:39:39)<Glowie>As far as I know Dev-Cpp is outdated and.. Bad :P
(06:40:24)<Glowie>I use Visual Studio as well and haven't tried Code Blocks, but I'd try it first if I didn't have Visual Studio
(07:39:06)<RotateMe_away>k thx, Code::Blocks seems fine
(07:39:52)<RotateMe_away>can't get the doryen lib compiled there too but that might very well be because of my non existant c/++ skills
(07:55:59)<RotateMe>fuck that i managed to compile it!
(07:57:52)<Glowie>Yay for you :P

(05:03:27)<joe6pack>my parents are 63 and 67
(05:03:56)<RotateMe>that's still a few years difference that's right
(05:04:37)<RotateMe>tried to make some money by giving courses to elderly people showing them how to use pcs
(05:05:21)<joe6pack>did it work?
(05:05:29)<RotateMe>i made quite some money but most of them couldn't use it afterwards which was kind of depressing so i didn't do it once more
(05:05:42)<RotateMe>i felt a little bad even though i did everything i could
(05:05:58)<joe6pack>you should have advised them to take notes
(05:06:20)<joe6pack>or photocopy a page or 2 with the instructions you were teaching them
(05:06:41)<joe6pack>so that they will have a reference 
(05:07:20)<RotateMe>i did that but if there's the slightest difference on the paper compared to what they see on screen, they had problems
(05:07:39)<joe6pack>hmm
(05:07:43)<joe6pack>yea that sucks
(05:07:48)<joe6pack>i know what you mean
(05:08:02)<RotateMe>you can't really cover everything
(05:08:08)<joe6pack>i probably wouldn't want to do that either
(05:08:23)<joe6pack>maybe children, but not the elderly  
(05:08:35)<RotateMe>but i think there are techniques to teach them stuff like that but you need some real good tricks
(05:08:37)<joe6pack>children learn really fast 
(05:08:40)<RotateMe>yeah
(05:08:53)<joe6pack>you also need to invest a lot of time 
(05:09:06)<RotateMe>i also did the programming group at our school
(05:09:11)<RotateMe>that was fun
(05:09:31)<RotateMe>it was 20 people at the beginning and 18 were there every single time
(05:09:40)<RotateMe>even though it was voluntarily
(05:09:52)<joe6pack>nice
(05:09:58)<joe6pack>what did you teach them?
(05:10:14)<RotateMe>basic, they were all 5th graders
(05:10:30)<RotateMe>qbasic back then :D
(05:11:00)<RotateMe>quite a few started to do their own stuff, and i think most of them continued to get more knowledge
(05:11:05)<joe6pack>i was thought that in junior high
(05:11:15)<joe6pack>"taught" 
(05:11:24)<RotateMe>hmm junior high is from when to when again?
(05:11:35)<joe6pack>but i think i already knew everything the teacher was trying to teacj
(05:11:51)<joe6pack>7th-9th
(05:12:02)<RotateMe>:D that's often the case
(05:12:21)<joe6pack>i was taught logo in 4th grade though 
(05:13:04)<joe6pack>i think the primary school i went to was really quite good
(05:13:34)<RotateMe>my earliest "in-school" programming experience was in 9th grade, that's why i decided to teach (or rather help) some 5th graders
(05:13:38)<joe6pack>we were using email in '93 or '92
(05:14:00)<joe6pack>which was really not common at the time
(05:14:15)<RotateMe>wow, i don't think i even knew what internet was at that time :D
(05:14:19)<joe6pack>at least not in primary schools  
(05:14:43)<joe6pack>i don't think i knew either... i just know how to write and read emails
(05:14:57)<joe6pack>and play games when the teacher wasn't looking :p
(05:15:28)<joe6pack>i remember there were 2 computer classes
(05:15:44)<joe6pack>the good one with brand spanking new 386s
(05:15:51)<RotateMe>it's funny how i grew up when the internet grew up, but the first time i realized it, it was in a "finnished" state
(05:15:55)<joe6pack>and the old one with apple ]['s
(05:16:15)<joe6pack>i think you mean the web
(05:16:25)<joe6pack>the internet is quite a bit older than that
(05:16:33)<RotateMe>yeah
(05:16:38)<joe6pack>the web started in 91 or 92 iirc
(05:17:24)<joe6pack>were they apple]['s or c64's?
(05:17:26)<joe6pack>hrm
(05:17:30)<joe6pack>i'm not sure
(05:18:00)<RotateMe>i just remember my 386 i got in 1999 ^^
(05:18:16)<joe6pack>that's a bit late for a 386...
(05:18:30)<RotateMe>quite late, but without it i wouldn't have used qbasic probably
(05:18:43)<RotateMe>i couldn't play the games i wanted so i tried to make them myself
(05:18:55)<joe6pack>was the same for me
(05:19:05)<joe6pack>i had to use an old pc xt till 95 or so
(05:19:13)<RotateMe>didn't work and i kept being jealous of my friends with ther friggin pentiums playing diablo 
(05:19:38)<joe6pack>yea... only for it was the 386's and 486's playing dune 2
(05:19:46)<oeb>How I got into basic was those magazines that you used to be able to buy. 6 pages of the magazine was basicly a code listing for something like snake =P
(05:20:08)<RotateMe>cool, never saw those in shops...
(05:20:21)<joe6pack>a freind of mine from school hooked me on it
(05:20:38)<oeb>This was back in the 80s mind.
(05:20:48)<joe6pack>RotateMe: those were mostly to be found during the 8 bit era 
(05:20:54)<oeb>I must have been about 8 or 9 I think.
(05:20:58)<RotateMe>k that's a bit too early for me
(05:21:16)<RotateMe>a little bit ^^
(05:21:21)<joe6pack>for me too, i only started programming in the early 90's
(05:21:41)<RotateMe>i think basic is quite good to start with
(05:21:41)<joe6pack>and mostly in the mid 90's
(05:21:49)<joe6pack>yea i guess so
(05:21:54)<joe6pack>logo as well
(05:22:04)<joe6pack>they are both good for teaching you the basics
(05:22:12)<oeb>The first thing I properly wrote from scratch was a poor IF game in Pascal
(05:22:25)<joe6pack>and they suck enough so that you'd eventually have to learn another language 
(05:22:40)<oeb>It sucked though, I had a few pre-programmed accecptable responses, no real parser or anything.
(05:22:55)<joe6pack>heh
(05:23:08)<joe6pack>i was an IF fiend, only book form IF :)
(05:23:22)<RotateMe>i started with graphics right away... a tank wars (or better: gorrillas) rip-of
(05:23:35)<joe6pack>you know the books where it say "turn to page 69 if you want to fight the dragon"
(05:23:44)<RotateMe>ah i had some of those
(05:23:50)<oeb>Ohh yes, Choose your own adventure
(05:23:53)<joe6pack>i was addicted to them
(05:24:00)<joe6pack>yea that's what it's called 
(05:24:00)<RotateMe>they were pretty hard at times
(05:24:04)<oeb>By Jackson and that other guy, I must have had about 30 of them
(05:24:26)<RotateMe>there was a pretty cool series "Lone Wolf"
(05:24:42)<RotateMe>it must have had 30 books with a continuing story and a continuing hero
(05:24:47)<joe6pack>i think i read that one...
(05:24:59)<joe6pack>the name sounds really familiar 
(05:25:15)<oeb>I remember a great one that had spells and everything. You would be told a spell, for example FLURT might be fireball. Later on when the opertunity arose to use to use it you would get 4 or 5 words and would need to remember what each spell did.
(05:25:27)<oeb>I think there was a manticore on the cover.
(05:25:41)<joe6pack>it didn't take me long to go from that to d&d
(05:25:52)<RotateMe>some book had a troll skiing on the cover :D
(05:26:21)<joe6pack>i was also really obsessed with [a]d&d all through junior high and high school 
(05:26:51)<joe6pack>it's amazing how much time me and my friends spent on that crap
(05:27:31)<RotateMe>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_from_the_Dark
(05:27:47)<RotateMe>awesome, there's a wiki page for every single book he made :D
(05:28:09)<joe6pack>heh
(05:28:09)<RotateMe>i hope they aren't worth much, i sold all of them long ago for nothing
(05:29:45)<RotateMe>makes me want to play them again :D

(05:30:28)<RotateMe>the german covers are different it seams
(05:30:30)<RotateMe>:D
(05:30:35)<joe6pack>i never owned any. got them all from the local library 
(05:31:45)<joe6pack>which i've heard is being closed down 
(05:32:12)<joe6pack>it was a really small neighbourhood library 
(05:32:47)<joe6pack>the city is is supposidely trying to merge them all into 1 big library in the center of town
(07:03:03)<RotateMe>anyone knows a good and fast c++ tutorial?
(07:03:33)<RotateMe>given i know some c, c# and very little java
(07:09:01)<purestrain>uh, if you know c and c# there should be no problem
(07:10:00)<purestrain>encapsulate everything as objects and you're fine
(07:15:26)<Glowie>Just basically teach yourself how classes, strings and STL work
(07:17:21)<joe6pack>i was an IF fiend, only book form IF :)aren't strings already part of the stl?
(07:17:28)<joe6pack>damn
(07:17:37)<joe6pack>ignore the 1st part of the sentence 
(07:17:55)<joe6pack>i pressed the up arrow a couple of times apparently 
(07:18:43)<purestrain>they are
(07:20:44)<RotateMe>well there was emphasis on "some" ^^
(07:21:19)<RotateMe>basically i need to refresh everything since the last thing i made dates back 3 years and after looking through the doryen lib codes i realized that there's not too much left
(07:22:00)<RotateMe>but the tutorials i found are far too long, i need something compressed
(07:22:43)<Glowie>I just wanted to add more emphasis on strings by separating them from STL :P
(07:23:30)<joe6pack>RotateMe_wDog: just program in c + the bits of c++ you already know 
(08:14:22)<purestrain>hmmm
(08:15:13)<purestrain>should attaching weapons in hand be 'real' action s?
(08:19:06)<purestrain>hmm... i think they should
(10:16:39)<purestrain>i wonder if inventories in other roguelikes are more or less a 'sideeffect' or are really coded as an inventory
(10:18:22)<purestrain>perhaps i should study the source of some games
(10:21:04)<ido>what do you mean?
(10:27:10)<purestrain>i mean, do most roguelikes keep a list of inventory items for a character? for each item? or do they use a tree?
(10:27:48)<ido>what matter does it make if the underlying data structure is a tree or a linked list?
(10:28:47)<purestrain>i think a tree is easier to handle ;-)
(10:29:12)<purestrain>and its sideeffect is a inventory system
(10:29:28)<ido>i don't see how, but more importantly i  don't see why that matters
(10:29:53)<ido>and i think we are not talking about the same thing
(10:30:01)<purestrain>i was just asking what the traditionally way is
(10:31:04)<ido>tree as in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure
(10:31:06)<ido>?
(10:31:13)<purestrain>yes
(10:31:27)<ido>what are the nodes in such a tree? for example 
(10:31:41)<purestrain>player, weapon, portion and so on
(10:32:20)<ido>i think you have formulated your question very poorly  
(10:32:55)<purestrain>perhaps i could formulate it better, if i were more used in english language ;-)
(10:33:09)<ido>by "tree" did you mean to ask if the inventory is part of the player description?
(10:33:15)<ido>it has nothing to do with english
(10:33:36)<ido>you assume we all know the structure of your design 
(10:33:40)<ido>we do not :)
(10:34:27)<purestrain>well, with tree i mean that each entity is basically a node; if they are carried or not is describes by the parent
(10:34:35)<purestrain>the root in my example would be the world
(10:34:46)<ido>ok
(10:34:53)<ido>now i understand
(10:35:31)<ido>i don't know about a "traditional" way of doing it, but:
(10:35:35)<ido>1. my games
(10:35:39)<ido>2. angband
(10:35:46)<ido>3. advanced rogue
(10:35:53)<ido>do not do it that wawy
(10:36:09)<ido>(i think, i haven't looked at all the sources of 2&3)
(10:36:34)<ido>i.e. an inventory is implemented as an inventory 
(10:36:46)<purestrain>so how do they handle relations between objects? just a linked list as inventory ?
(10:37:00)<ido>i don't know
(10:37:55)<ido>(doesn't have to be a linked list btw, that is an implementation detail) 
(10:38:16)<purestrain>of course, i mean a seperate collection/array/whatever
(10:39:53)<ido>i don't know, but i can guess that a "combined" object (like dagger + poison) is transformed to a new object (poisoned dagger) in the inventory
(10:40:21)<purestrain>ah, ok
(10:40:22)<ido>and "ingredients" (dagger, poison) are then deleted 
(10:43:25)<ido>http://www.theonion.com/content/video/in_the_know_how_can_we_make_the
(11:35:21)<ido>can any of you access ted.com?
(11:38:40)<ido>gary gygax is dead
(11:41:02)<jraregris>wow
(11:41:08)<jraregris>just now?

(04:56:44)<oeb>My dad is going through his mid life crisis atm, he bought a mazda 6 a few months back. Lovely car to drive
(04:57:35)<ido>supposidly subarus are as well
(04:57:53)<oeb>Yes, I prefer the mazdas though.
(04:58:17)<oeb>One of his friends (Also going through a mid life crisis) bought a subaru.
(04:58:22)<ido>i don't even have a driver's licence 
(04:58:28)<oeb>Although worst of all his friends is Bernard.
(04:58:34)<ido>porsche?
(04:58:43)<oeb>Bernard bought a porsche in November.
(04:58:48)<ido>hah
(04:58:57)<oeb>I have no idea what model it was, all I know is VRT was 150,000
(04:59:07)<ido>the worst ones always go for the porsche
(04:59:26)<oeb>In Ireland VRT has to be paid on all cars imported into the country. It's 25% of the cars current market value.
(04:59:41)<oeb>That means he paid AT LEAST 750,000 euro on the car.
(04:59:48)<ido>vrt? is that like value added tax?
(04:59:59)<oeb>No, Vehicle Registration Tax
(05:00:06)<oeb>It's paid when you import a car.
(05:00:24)<oeb>Can you imagine having so much money you can spend three quaters of a million on a car?
(05:00:25)<ido>so how much are all the taxes on a car combined? 
(05:00:43)<oeb>I dont think you pay VAT on an imported car.
(05:00:55)<oeb>VRT is just Irelands excuse to make some money out of it.
(05:01:01)<ido>you mean self imported? 
(05:01:04)<oeb>You pay VAT on a new car (21%)
(05:01:07)<oeb>Yes.
(05:01:12)<ido>so that's not too bad
(05:01:21)<ido>only 4% more than normal
(05:01:32)<oeb>Not really, because it's charged on the current market value too.
(05:01:42)<ido>unless you have to pay the vat in the country you bought it in as well...
(05:01:47)<ido>so that's 21% more 
(05:02:23)<oeb>For example if you bring a car that would have oridginally been worth 10,000 , but has had 20,000 worth of work done to it, you only pay the VRT off the base price. So that would be 2,500 euro
(05:02:32)<oeb>Even though you could sell it for 30,000
(05:03:11)<oeb>Alot of people import cars to Ireland. It is cheaper than buying them here mostly. The UK is much cheaper for second hand cars than Ireland.
(05:04:12)<ido>but that tax rate isn't too bad. a lot of countries (especially in continental europe) have much higher taxes on cars
(05:05:01)<ido>750,000 euros for a car is still insane 
(05:05:15)<ido>i didn't even know you could pay so much for a car
(05:05:46)<ido>unless it's some antique Rolls Royce or something 
(05:06:16)<oeb>Heh, there are more expensive cars =P
(05:06:18)<ido>i thought a new porsche is maybe 200,000 euro
(05:06:36)<oeb>Ohh some are, but this would be nearly top of the line porsche
(05:06:48)<ido>crazy
(05:07:14)<oeb>There might be three or four models of porsche available at each time, one will normally be 'cheap' at about the 100,000 mark.
(05:08:27)<ido>that makes your father's mazda seem down right frugal
(05:09:34)<oeb>Yup
(05:09:47)<oeb>I think a new mazda 6 is about 20,000
(05:10:02)<oeb>A new RX-8 is 35-40 I think
(05:10:17)<oeb>Actually a new mazda-6 would be closer to 30
(05:10:22)<oeb>(I think)

(07:00:35)<RotateMe>the woodmachine is awesome ^^
(07:00:57)<RotateMe>just sent a mail to one of my teachers, forcing him to build this for our next class

(01:26:39)<Polaris>hello
(01:28:51)<Polaris>do someone have sometimes for noobish question about rogue like world?
(01:34:22)<makke>depends on the question :)
(01:37:19)<makke>I am not really a roguelike veteran myself
(01:41:50)<RotateMe_away>just ask ^^
(01:56:44)<Polaris>is the news group about roguelike dev and other is not online anymore?
(01:57:48)<Polaris>mean when i retrieve the mail from the news group with my thunderbird the message date stop in 2006...
(01:58:07)<Polaris>and sorry for my bad english i am french...
(02:02:22)<RotateMe>no the rgrd newsgroup is still on and very active
(02:02:39)<RotateMe>i think the provider you get your news from doesn't have the group somehow anymore
(02:03:03)<RotateMe>you can use google groups if you are fine with it
(02:03:15)<RotateMe>http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.development/topics
(02:03:22)<RotateMe>hope this helped i got to go
(02:03:33)<RotateMe>hope you will check by more often!
(02:11:16)<Polaris>ok rotate to late for thanks but thanks anyway
(02:45:27)<Polaris>good night people!

(09:16:54)<deveah>Moldova = 80% romanian ; 20% russian
(09:20:23)<TMC>cool
(10:32:30)<TMC>can anyone name any games with random floor plans?
(10:32:40)<TMC>I mean, random maps without space between rooms
(10:33:01)<TMC>seems harder to create

(01:17:32)<RotateMe>hi joe/ido
(01:17:36)<joe6pack>hi RotateMe 
(01:17:39)<RotateMe>who's running the bot atm?
(01:17:42)<joe6pack>i am
(01:17:54)<RotateMe>could you send me the current logfile?
(01:17:55)<joe6pack>but i am not developing it 
(01:18:02)<joe6pack>i will commit it to svn
(01:18:16)<RotateMe>k
(01:18:19)<joe6pack>should i stop it?
(01:18:25)<joe6pack>do you want to run it?
(01:18:54)<RotateMe>no not really, just want the logs
(01:19:02)<joe6pack>k
(01:19:33)<joe6pack>you can take it from http://yehieli.info/rgrd/log.txt
(01:19:54)<joe6pack>it is updated automatically 
(01:20:09)<joe6pack>i run the bot on the same computer as the web serve 
(01:20:10)<joe6pack>r
(01:20:51)<RotateMe>that's pretty cool actually
(01:21:26)<joe6pack>i try to keep that computer on as often as possible 
(01:22:51)<joe6pack>but sometimes the noise from the fan drives me insane when it's otherwise really quiet
(01:23:25)<RotateMe>yeah i know that problem
(01:23:29)<joe6pack>so it is not online 100% of the time 
(01:23:43)<RotateMe>my laptop is VERY quiet but my external hd is loud as shit compared to that
(01:25:16)<joe6pack>deveah's mp3 sounds more alien than horror-esque 
(01:25:26)<RotateMe>i like it somehow
(01:25:31)<joe6pack>yes it's nice
(01:25:53)<RotateMe>the beginning sounds very snes final fantasy like
(01:26:00)<joe6pack>i should try to make a living out of indie game development 
(01:26:09)<joe6pack>i woukld need graphics for that though
(01:26:31)<joe6pack>maybe sell it through something like steam 
(01:26:33)<RotateMe>after that it reminds me of the tune of seizure dome: http://cactusquid.proboards99.com/index.cgi?board=games&action=display&thread=20
(01:27:02)<RotateMe>well the good olde graphics problem...
(01:27:10)<joe6pack>and sound as well
(01:27:30)<joe6pack>i will have to pay someone to create gfx and another one to create sfx/music
(01:27:44)<RotateMe>sound is not as much of a problem
(01:27:44)<joe6pack>but i think it is doable 
(01:27:53)<joe6pack>only not very profitable...
(01:27:55)<RotateMe>sfx can be created by cool freeware progs
(01:28:08)<RotateMe>for music you just have to know some people
(01:28:14)<joe6pack>gfx as well, but if you want good quality it's something else
(01:28:27)<joe6pack>you can say the same about gfx
(01:28:53)<RotateMe>yeah but gfx people that make graphics that can be taken for games are rare
(01:29:23)<joe6pack>and you think people that'll create good music for free aren't?
(01:29:31)<joe6pack>seems the same to me 
(01:29:48)<joe6pack>especially if you want to sell the game
(01:29:58)<RotateMe>hmm i have three real friends who make electronical music that could be included in games
(01:30:08)<joe6pack>hrm
(01:30:29)<RotateMe>look through myspace or some mod archives
(01:30:55)<RotateMe>ask the people if it's okay if their music will be included in your game if you pay them like a few percent
(01:31:19)<RotateMe>the problem with graphics is, that they are created FOR a game, and after used once they loose their integrity
(01:32:15)<RotateMe>btw if you have a game that is in need of music i can provide you some tracks
(01:32:16)<joe6pack>yea
(01:32:30)<RotateMe>depending on the style of your game of course
(01:32:47)<joe6pack>anyway
(01:32:58)<joe6pack>i won't do anything commercial anytime soon
(01:33:02)<joe6pack>if at all
(01:33:24)<joe6pack>i think the chances of actually maki ng enough money to live off of it are slim
(01:33:33)<RotateMe>yeah very slim
(01:33:45)<RotateMe>but depends on in which country you are living
(01:34:00)<joe6pack>maybe i can save up some money and try it sometime for a year or so
(01:34:02)<joe6pack>austria
(01:34:25)<joe6pack>and sometimes in israel, which is not much cheaper than austria 
(01:34:59)<joe6pack>i would say the cost of living in israel is maybe somewhere between western germany and eastern germany 
(01:35:06)<joe6pack>maybe a bit closer to eastern germany
(01:35:27)<joe6pack>but it is getting more expensive all the time
(01:35:45)<joe6pack>i think soon it will be as expensive as everywhere in western europe 
(01:35:56)<RotateMe>yeah i'm moving to eastern germany because of that :D
(01:36:08)<RotateMe>well the main reason is that there's a good university for math
(01:36:26)<joe6pack>i've heard berlin is an awsome city to be a student in
(01:36:40)<joe6pack>cheap & a lot of culture and stuff to do
(01:36:46)<RotateMe>that's where i'm going :D
(01:36:48)<RotateMe>eastern part
(01:36:58)<RotateMe>or better northern part which is in east germany
(01:37:12)<joe6pack>yea that should be considerably cheaper than where you are now 
(01:37:17)<RotateMe>there's not this division anymore of course but there still are price differences
(01:37:23)<RotateMe>yes
(01:37:33)<joe6pack>there is a very big price difference, i would say
(01:37:57)<joe6pack>Munich and Frankfurt are more expensive than Vienna 
(01:38:17)<RotateMe>and munich sucks on top of that ;)
(01:38:19)<RotateMe>http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/tracks/
(01:38:33)<joe6pack>really? i was there once as a turist and it seemed ok
(01:38:33)<RotateMe>uploaded three tracks a friend made for an arena shooter i wanted to do
(01:38:43)<joe6pack>just a normal city 
(01:39:05)<RotateMe>yeah just some not-so-nice things happened there, i think it's okay in the end
(01:39:08)<joe6pack>i've found Munich to very similar to Vienna 
(01:39:15)<RotateMe>i was there at the october fest
(01:40:19)<joe6pack>if you mean the nazis, that's everywhere in germany and austria. i don't think that today you would find more neo nazis in munich than the rest of germany 
(01:41:15)<joe6pack>everywhere else in Bavaria, maybe... but Munich is fairly liberal from what i've seen 
(01:41:22)<RotateMe>yeah but it's a whole other mentality towards them in different parts of the country
(01:41:57)<joe6pack>Munich and Vienna are islands of liberalism in the vast sea of conservatism that is Bavaria and Austria 
(01:42:39)<RotateMe>yeah that was my impression too... i have been in whole other parts of bavaria
(01:42:59)<RotateMe>but that was more funny than dangerous or sad :D
(01:43:18)<joe6pack>yes but these 2 cities in particular are good. they are totally different than their surroundings 
(01:43:20)<RotateMe>some stereotypes are just closer to reality then one might think ;)
(01:43:40)<joe6pack>:)
(01:43:53)<joe6pack>stereotypes are there for a reason ;0
(01:44:02)<joe6pack>often they are at least partially true 
(01:48:05)<RotateMe>i have been messing around with the doryen engine recently and i have to say it's pretty awesome
(01:48:27)<RotateMe>i will use this for my 7drl
(01:48:30)<RotateMe>oh btw
(01:48:32)<RotateMe>wtf
(01:48:36)<RotateMe>it started :D
(01:48:51)<joe6pack>:0
(01:48:54)<joe6pack>good luck
(01:48:54)<RotateMe>well i will not start before 20th of march but gotta look at rgrd
(01:49:07)<joe6pack>i gotta study for my exam
(01:49:15)<joe6pack>differential equations...
(01:49:37)<joe6pack>at least it's easier than universal algebra or measure theory :p
(01:49:50)<joe6pack>i think i will actually do ok in this one
(01:49:54)<joe6pack>bye
(01:51:02)<RotateMe>whoot that's more 7drls than i tought...
(02:00:10)<TMC>variable width AND height bitmapped font?
(02:00:12)<TMC>wtf?
(02:00:42)<RotateMe>wat
(02:00:59)<RotateMe>libtcod?
(02:01:04)<TMC>no
(02:01:33)<RotateMe>hmm... what else then?
(02:01:45)<TMC>reading the patch instructions (mentions the obstacles they encountered) for Shiren the Wanderer
(02:02:04)<TMC>psst
(02:02:08)<TMC>[22:39] <TMC> can anyone name any games with random floor plans?
(02:02:08)<TMC>[22:39] <TMC> I mean, random maps without space between rooms
(02:02:08)<TMC>[22:39] <TMC> seems harder to create
(02:03:00)<TMC>I'm thinking of starting by generating the building shape, then dividing that into different areas
(02:03:56)<TMC>eg, if it's a castle maybe sleeping quarters, kitchen, halls, living areas, battlements
(02:04:14)<RotateMe>hmmm you could do it like this: http://jice.nospam.googlepages.com/basicdungeongeneration
(02:04:22)<TMC>and then somehow dividing those areas into rooms
(02:04:39)<TMC>.nospam. ?
(02:04:47)<RotateMe>just like that...
(02:04:52)<RotateMe>dunno :D
(02:05:09)<TMC>ah thanks
(02:05:14)<TMC>that is appropriate
(02:05:14)<RotateMe>Shiren is a great game btw
(02:05:21)<TMC>which one?
(02:05:28)<TMC>I understand it's a series
(02:05:41)<RotateMe>yeah, just the last few steps are different if you want to have no space between the rooms
(02:05:55)<RotateMe>the second i guess? don't really know... "the wanderer"
(02:05:56)<RotateMe>for snes
(02:06:16)<RotateMe>when you die you keep stuff in a warehouse and triggered events keep being triggered
(02:06:19)<RotateMe>very cool idea
(02:06:32)<TMC>triggered events?
(02:06:47)<TMC>you mean, one time events reoccur after you've died?
(02:07:27)<RotateMe>things happen in the town and if you come there another time (after dieing once) those things continue instead of repead
(02:08:16)<TMC>ah
(04:54:49)<joe6pack>hi
(04:55:25)<joe6pack>anyone remember that small proof of concept rl with the maps that have no floors?
(04:55:47)<joe6pack>you would go from higher levels to lower ones in a continuous way 
(04:55:56)<joe6pack>i don't know how i can describe it any better
(04:57:48)<Glowie>I do
(04:57:59)<joe6pack>it was really neat
(04:58:04)<Glowie>Yup
(04:59:57)<joe6pack>do you havwe a link?
(05:02:11)<joe6pack>found it 
(05:02:20)<joe6pack>http://sourceforge.net/projects/yakamura-legacy
(05:02:25)<joe6pack>think it was this one
(05:02:26)<Glowie>Yep
(05:02:28)<joe6pack>it's a good idea
(05:02:34)<joe6pack>maybe i should use it next time
(05:03:45)<joe6pack>i've gathered a couple of these cute ideas that i might one day implement in a small game
(05:04:51)<joe6pack>another one is the facing-los/stealth idea i implemented in caverover a year and a half ago
(05:05:33)<joe6pack>when i think about it, caverover was actually more feature complete than cryprover, but it was further from being a full game
(05:05:51)<joe6pack>the core concept was not as small as cryptrover's
(05:06:48)<joe6pack>what else? hmm
(05:07:11)<joe6pack>there was another idea i remember wanting to steal from a 7drl i played recently 
(05:18:39)<RotateMe>:( linux only
(07:10:17)<purestrain>i'm not very motivated in actually programming today :-(
(07:30:38)<RotateMe>when i am like this but something needs to be done, i just start and after some time i get so into some pieces of code that motivation comes from itself
(07:36:22)<Glowie>Woah I'm not the only one who does that o_o
(07:36:31)<Glowie>Though most of the time when I don't feel like coding I just play something
(07:47:00)<ido>Glowie: not wanting to code is the best motivation to learn for an exam :p
(07:47:13)<Glowie>Haha
(07:47:49)<ido>that's why doing a lot programming for a few weeks before the exams start is a good thing
(07:48:50)<Glowie>I can find motivation for studying at any time though
(07:48:58)<ido>really?
(07:49:09)<ido>that's good
(07:50:23)<purestrain>30 minutes to go... i think i'll read some roguebasin articles :-)
(07:50:26)<ido>i think it helps if you're studying for something easy. buty studying for a sunbject you know nothing about and having to go through a really painful learning experience at the beginning is really difficult 
(07:50:37)<Glowie>Yup, I guess it's a bit strange as 99% of people I know can't do this :P
(07:50:57)<ido>of course, 
(07:51:11)<ido>it also helps if you are interested in the subject at hand
(07:51:12)<ido>;)
(07:51:40)<ido>after many years of studying i am only continuing because i want to finish it, not because of interest 
(07:51:48)<Glowie>Hehe
(07:51:51)<Glowie>Works too
(07:51:55)<Glowie>What are you studying?
(07:52:08)<ido>M.Sc. in mathematics 
(07:52:37)<Glowie>Maths for the win \o/
(07:53:00)<ido>i kind of got sucked into the master's program before finishing the bachelor's 
(07:53:14)<Glowie>How?
(07:53:35)<ido>until recently in austria there was just a 5 year program, at the end of which you get an M.Sc.
(07:54:06)<ido>the seperation of a 3 years B.Sc. program + 2 years M.Sc. is realatively new here
(07:54:19)<ido>and i am still in the old program
(07:54:40)<ido>and if i switch now i will lose all the progress i've made after the bachelor's part
(07:54:49)<ido>so i just keep on going.
(07:55:07)<ido>hopefully soon enough i will be done with all the courses
(07:55:09)<Glowie>Ah, that sucks for people who would be satisfied with bachelor's :(
(07:55:26)<ido>then i will only have to write my thesis 
(07:55:27)<ido>yes
(07:55:39)<Glowie>Write about calculus, calculus rocks \o/
(07:55:46)<Glowie>Integrals and derivatives for the win
(07:56:11)<ido>on the other hand, it motivates you to continue studying. otherwise you would get nothing, no bachelor's and no master's 
(07:56:24)<ido>not really my area of interest 
(07:56:37)<ido>i like game theory. number theory is also neat
(07:56:47)<Glowie>Game theory in maths?
(07:56:50)<ido>yes
(07:56:55)<Glowie>Didn't know that was a part of maths
(07:56:55)<ido>that's where it came from
(07:57:00)<Glowie>Neat
(07:57:15)<ido>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory
(07:57:28)<Glowie>(I love calculus and analytic geometry)
(07:57:30)<ido>"Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics which is used in the social sciences..."
(07:57:47)<ido>it's in the very 1st sentence :p
(07:58:18)<ido>i've had enough of it all. i want to get it over with
(07:58:33)<ido>and then do nothing. although i will probably need to fins a job again
(07:58:34)<Glowie>Hehe
(07:58:35)<ido>:(
(07:58:42)<Glowie>That's life
(07:59:35)<ido>at least i will have a nice diploma for my mother to be proud of 
(07:59:53)<Glowie>Hehe
(08:00:39)<ido>my parents are going to china!
(08:00:48)<ido>decided just like that
(08:00:53)<ido>told me about it yesterday
(08:01:17)<Glowie>On a vacation? Or to live there?
(08:01:21)<ido>vacation 
(08:01:32)<ido>they are not that adventures 
(08:01:34)<Glowie>I'd rather go to Japan :P
(08:01:44)<Glowie>Or perhaps South Korea
(08:01:49)<ido>they have been to japan several times already 
(08:01:59)<Glowie>Oh
(08:02:01)<Glowie>Veterans :P
(08:02:04)<ido>as well as hong kong and tailand 
(08:02:14)<ido>but never to mainland china
(08:02:41)<ido>my father has also been to Taiwan 
(08:03:15)<ido>what would you do in south korea?
(08:03:18)<ido>play starcraft?
(08:03:35)<Glowie>Yup ^_^
(08:03:41)<Glowie>And watch it there
(08:03:48)<ido>all of the korean girls i've met have been really cute
(08:03:54)<Glowie>Haha

(02:43:13)<RotateMe>gngiht!
(09:28:31)<deveah>what happened to ido?
(11:06:54)<purestrain>i'm proud of my zombies... they are so dumb that they block each other
(11:08:27)<deveah>my zombies get over each other making a big spit on the screen
(11:08:42)<deveah>if zombiex<playerx then zombiex+=1 ...
(11:11:56)<deveah>how do you move in japaneselegacy?
(03:10:31)<deveah>how dumb can you be to byt a psp when there aren't any games for it????
(03:26:20)<RotateMe>what are you talking about
(03:26:52)<RotateMe>aside from millions of snes, psone, nes, whatnot perfectly emulated games there are lots of good games especially for psp
(03:27:05)<RotateMe>and then there's nethack, angband and POWDER
(03:28:19)<deveah>yes, but not in Romania
(03:36:02)<RotateMe>well you can get them everywhere via bit torrent :D
(03:36:19)<RotateMe>but therefore you'd need a 1.5 firmware or some custom firmware
(03:40:42)<Aerton>add zx-spectrum emulator and dosbox
(04:07:31)<deveah>the kid i'm talking about is a darn retard
(04:20:34)<jraregris>because he bought a psp?
(04:20:39)<deveah>RotateMe, you can get them, but how do you put them on the real machine?
(04:21:09)<deveah>no, because he buys all the shit and then realises he shouldn't have bought it
(04:32:10)<RotateMe>deveah, usb connection?
(04:32:35)<RotateMe>my memory card is capable of about 8 games at a time and lots of other stuff
(04:34:27)<deveah>oh
(04:34:29)<deveah>greaty then
(04:34:41)<deveah>how much does the battery last? do you have Flash on it?
(04:35:00)<deveah>adobe flash ofcourse
(04:35:14)<RotateMe>don't know, but i don't think so
(04:35:25)<RotateMe>battery lasts about 4 hours or so
(04:35:40)<deveah>0.o too little - i want an n-gage now
(04:35:40)<RotateMe>i rarely play without being able to reload

(04:38:59)<RotateMe>i didn't try it ... but it's nice to have it :D
(04:39:08)<RotateMe>gotta get back to financial accounting
(04:39:17)<RotateMe>will be a hell of an exam tomorrow :(
(04:39:18)<deveah>but how about the nds? does it have usb cables?
(04:40:07)<RotateMe>i believe not but it sure has some hot games
(04:40:16)<RotateMe>izuna sounds like a good rl
(04:40:23)<RotateMe>bit like shiren

(05:38:54)<RotateMe>90% of my log consists of you joining, quitting and renaming ^^
(05:46:04)<ido>a lot of activity in the newsgruop in the past couple of days
(05:46:13)<ido>more 7drl's than i expected
(05:46:35)<deveah>idoooo!
(05:46:42)<ido>i think there are 17?
(05:46:45)<ido>hi deveah 
(05:47:09)<ido>nice song, btw
(05:47:23)<deveah>i wish they would all make it
(05:47:24)<ido>although i thought it sounded more alien than horror 
(05:47:39)<ido>if half of them will it will be good
(05:47:47)<deveah>thanks - 8bit lo-fi tracked
(05:48:09)<ido>i have to go back to learning for my exam in 2 days
(05:48:17)<ido>have a nice weekend 
(05:48:19)<deveah>exam for...
(05:48:30)<ido>differential equations 
(05:48:40)<deveah>maths then
(05:48:44)<ido>yes
(05:48:46)<deveah>i never learned anything for maths
(05:48:55)<ido>all of my exams are in mathematics 
(05:49:03)<RotateMe>17!? that's awesome
(05:49:09)<RotateMe>is anyone in here doing one?
(05:49:17)<ido>from what i've counted anyway
(05:49:28)<deveah>i never learn for romanian language and yet, i get 9 and 10 marks!
(05:49:43)<ido>these were the number of posts with 7drl in the subject line fromn the past couple of days
(05:50:03)<ido>well wait until university, is all i've got to say ;)
(05:50:22)<ido>i never learned for exams when i was your age either
(05:51:09)<deveah>cya, got homework
(06:16:34)<purestrain>yehaw, random map generation works !
(09:13:46)<joe6pack>makke, what's up?
(09:13:59)<joe6pack>why do you keep leaving and rejoining? 
(09:14:08)<makke>coz my sound system is fubared
(10:16:09)<RotateMe>EezT/DaEezT is doing that the whole day so it's okay makke ^^
(10:28:27)<purestrain>ah, today was a great day
(10:28:40)<joe6pack>in what respect? 
(10:28:47)<purestrain>coding
(10:28:57)<joe6pack>:)
(10:29:04)<purestrain>the drawback is, everything gets more and more spaghetti like
(10:29:11)<joe6pack>huh
(10:29:16)<joe6pack>how much code do you have?
(10:29:21)<joe6pack>in terms of loc
(10:29:43)<purestrain>don't know, i have no tool to count lines
(10:29:55)<joe6pack>sclc 
(10:30:03)<joe6pack>and a ton of other free ones
(10:30:34)<joe6pack>you have to actively try to write less code. 
(10:30:46)<joe6pack>a small code base doesn't happen by itself
(10:31:31)<joe6pack>there's a lot of code i could have written in half the time or less if i didn't care about writing as little as possible 
(10:32:17)<joe6pack>but it helps you later on in maintenance or if you want to reuse some of your code
(10:32:20)<purestrain>yeah; but i want to get finished, so i'm ending in many hacks :-(
(10:32:29)<joe6pack>fair enough
(10:34:09)<joe6pack>Je n'ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n'ai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus courte.
(10:34:15)<purestrain>and for the first day i got really far i think. Actions/Movement, Map generation  (almost, some minor glitches) and a simple combat system works
(10:34:18)<joe6pack>--Blaise Pascal
(10:34:33)<joe6pack>good :)
(10:34:37)<joe6pack>keep going 
(10:35:32)<joe6pack>"I have made this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to make it shorter."
(10:36:06)<joe6pack>one of my favorite quotes; i can really identify with it 
(10:36:45)<purestrain>should slow moving monsters react to nearby enemies? i've currently the problem that a very slow moving monster does not react if i'm dancing around it
(10:37:25)<joe6pack>what doese speed have to do with it
(10:37:27)<joe6pack>?
(10:38:01)<purestrain>because if a movement from one tile to another takes 200 turns, and my movement takes 20 turns, i can walk around it
(10:38:16)<purestrain>and its only thinking after the movement
(10:38:36)<joe6pack>so it doesn't get the chance to move?
(10:38:48)<joe6pack>because you are already away by the time it does?
(10:39:13)<purestrain>yes.. my monster is walking up to me for 200 turns and react only if the movement is finished
(10:39:50)<joe6pack>i thogut moving to you is its reaction 
(10:40:31)<purestrain>yes, but for the next 200 time units. So i can turn around it if i'm much faster without any damage
(10:40:52)<purestrain>nice english i am talking, yoda like
(10:41:08)<joe6pack>but isn't that what's it's supposed to be like?
(10:41:50)<purestrain>perhaps.... but why should i fear a really powerfull slow moving monster, if i can chase, make a hit, and leave without any reactions ?
(10:41:55)<joe6pack>i think yoda-like would be "so around it to turn, i can"
(10:42:24)<joe6pack>then make the monster faster ;)
(10:43:07)<joe6pack>any change you make would effectively make the mosnter faster, if i understood you correctly 
(10:43:51)<purestrain>but if i make it faster, its no more the 'slow moving deady creature from hell'
(10:44:27)<joe6pack>moving 50% slower than you are is already very slow
(10:44:47)<purestrain>uh; i made it almost 10% :-)
(10:45:03)<joe6pack>that's what i am saying. it sounds way too exaggerated 
(10:45:17)<purestrain>yeah; i'm thinking about it
(10:46:07)<joe6pack>look at existing games. in crawl i think the slowest monster is that worm one, which is i think still a bit more than 50% the player's speed
(10:46:55)<joe6pack>i know from my expereince, that making the arachnids in cryptrover 66% the speed of the player made them very noticebly slower 
(10:49:12)<joe6pack>i would say, don't worry about it now; finish a preliminary version of the game, and if it's too slow or too fast the players will tell you about it very quickly 
(10:49:34)<joe6pack>balance can come after all the basics are done
(10:49:52)<purestrain>you're right.. it would be to time consuming if i check every bit for balance
(10:50:11)<purestrain>perhaps it doesn't even make fun and time was wasted for balance ;-)
(10:50:20)<joe6pack>right
(10:50:50)<joe6pack>or maybe the game would still be too difficult and you end up undoing these balance changes 
(10:51:17)<joe6pack>you can't tell if it's too difficult or too easy before it's playable 
(11:24:24)<purestrain>almost midnight

(08:05:40)<purestrain>hua; nice bug... i can take doors
(08:06:05)<purestrain>thats makes the game a little bit strategic.. picking up doors and placing them anywhere
(08:07:00)<joe6pack>hey,
(08:07:04)<purestrain>huh.... that also means i can pick monsters
(08:07:10)<joe6pack>that's actually not a bad idea

(08:07:38)<Gamer2k4>7DRL discussion?
(08:07:41)<purestrain>yeah, thats what i intended... but not monsters and doors :-)
(08:08:01)<joe6pack>you can do something like that boulder pushing game
(08:08:04)<joe6pack>what's it called
(08:08:07)<purestrain>pushing obstacles, carrying chairs in front of a door
(08:08:19)<Gamer2k4>sokoban?
(08:08:23)<joe6pack>yes
(08:09:12)<joe6pack>or boulder dash
(08:11:55)<RotateMe>can you only pickup doors while they are opened?
(08:12:15)<RotateMe>and how do you pickup monsters, or can you somehow move on the same field they are?
(08:12:21)<purestrain>i can take them all the time.. but that was not intended
(08:12:37)<RotateMe>but damn... picking up monsters that's a great idea!!!
(08:12:38)<purestrain>pressing P ? after that i show a popup with all entities in range
(08:12:50)<RotateMe>oh damn it's already done ... pokemon :(
(08:12:55)<RotateMe>ah okay
(08:13:12)<RotateMe>thought it was the classical g pickup
(08:13:27)<purestrain>uh... g; p... whatever ;-)
(08:13:38)<Glowie>, is the pick up key
(08:13:39)<Glowie>Always :<
(08:15:01)<Gamer2k4>I thought it would be nifty to treat unconscious monsters as items in my main project

(08:16:17)<Gamer2k4>treated as in your pack, with get and drop and all
(08:16:24)<joe6pack>i was wondering what happens when your hobbit rogue tries to out that unconscious mutalisk in his back pack 
(08:16:38)<Gamer2k4>heh
(08:17:11)<joe6pack>speaking of mutalisks 
(08:17:20)<Gamer2k4>it would be a sort of quest thing..."take the -foo- prisoner" or something

(08:19:21)<joe6pack>your code is starting to spaghettyfy? 
(08:19:27)<purestrain>instead of asking "what can i do with you, entity" i'm hardcoding (if class=door then action=open )

(08:20:13)<Gamer2k4>what project are you working on?
(08:20:24)<joe6pack>his 7drl iirc

(08:47:31)<RotateMe>and now it is already there
(08:47:37)<RotateMe>pretty cool story
(09:02:19)<joe6pack>RotateMe: actually it's already off...
(09:02:32)<joe6pack>there is a new lotd

(09:46:08)<joe6pack>nice!
(09:46:58)<Epyon|BURNOUT>This looks like AliensRL graphical version O.o
(09:47:45)<purestrain>mainly because the corridor cross? ;-0
(09:47:59)<Epyon|BURNOUT>hmm, I guess
(09:48:29)<purestrain>yeah; but that cross is rather random... i divided the map into 6x6 parts, and made corridors randomly around the parts
(09:48:48)<purestrain>itself the rooms use subdividing, just like aliens rl
(09:51:36)<purestrain>http://retroforge.de/%7Emd/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/map.png <- here is an example map

(05:09:27)<RotateMe>why are there so many articles on erlang in the last few dasy?
(05:09:30)<RotateMe>*days
(05:09:43)<joe6pack>days?
(05:09:50)<joe6pack>i would say months
(05:10:32)<joe6pack>erlang&haskell are the cool languages atm
(05:12:08)<RotateMe>hm and erlang is really the thing the wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29) is about?
(05:12:14)<RotateMe>doesn't sound cool at all :D
(05:12:20)<joe6pack>they have been replacing ruby and python as the fashionable languages for maybe a year already
(05:12:55)<joe6pack>i don't know, i have programmed in neither erlang nor haskell
(05:13:01)<RotateMe>k
(05:13:12)<RotateMe>abap is teh coolest anyway :P
(05:22:03)<RotateMe>this looks pretty nice http://www.jjj.de/fxt/#fxtbook
(05:22:13)<RotateMe>(the book at near bottom)
(05:24:57)<joe6pack>oh man
(05:25:04)<joe6pack>the new firefox is nice 
(05:25:19)<joe6pack>first time i try ff3
(05:29:34)<RotateMe>dling right now
(05:36:01)<deveah>hello
(05:36:32)<deveah>what's the rl-in-the-challenge status?
(05:36:50)<joe6pack>you mean how many?
(05:49:46)<joe6pack>should i show the last known position of unseen enemies?
(05:50:26)<joe6pack>figured i'll take another look at the cryptrover source after now that  my exams are over
(05:54:59)<deveah>oh, did you get the results yet?
(05:55:11)<joe6pack>i just took it now
(05:55:25)<deveah>was it *hard* ?
(05:55:34)<joe6pack>it will take several weeks, knowing how this professor is
(05:55:52)<joe6pack>yes, somewhat hard
(05:56:16)<deveah>i'll remake the RoRLE for fast console-output
(05:56:42)<deveah>it'll refresh everything on the fov only
(05:56:51)<deveah>oh bad idea
(05:57:49)<deveah>http://www.isitchristmas.com/
(06:06:26)<joe6pack>what's up purestrain?
(06:08:56)<purestrain>i need more time :P
(06:09:54)<joe6pack>for the 7drl?
(06:09:59)<purestrain>yes
(06:10:08)<joe6pack>then what are you doing here? go code!
(06:10:11)<joe6pack>:p
(06:18:44)<deveah>i have to give to get
(06:21:40)<purestrain>go code is nice to say... i'm doomed, i'm currently more often playing my game instead of coding
(06:28:41)<joe6pack>that's a good sign :)
(06:28:45)<joe6pack>it means it's fun
(06:29:27)<deveah>or buggy
(06:29:36)<deveah>cya
(06:33:54)<purestrain>3 minium todos today: 1. make zombies a little more intelligent, 2. proper line-of-sight, 3. proper field-of-view
(07:35:10)<purestrain>the walking dead is now quite challenging :-)
(08:50:17)<purestrain>so what fov system should i use?
(08:50:28)<purestrain>something which can get implemented in almost 2 hours please :-)
(08:58:00)<purestrain>i think one must reside anywhere on my hdd
(08:58:04)<purestrain>but i don't find it
(08:58:47)<purestrain>oh... there it was :-) an old abandoned c++ project
(09:36:36)<RotateMe>just normal raycasting
(09:37:03)<RotateMe>if you want you can ehance it by lighting up certain walltiles
(09:37:15)<RotateMe>:D just found a bug in the new firefox
(09:37:44)<purestrain>http://www.geocities.com/temerra/los_rays.html <- i've implemented this one, but it doesn't seem to work
(09:37:48)<purestrain>or i made a mistake
(09:39:51)<RotateMe>i tried this once but it's not easy imo
(09:40:19)<RotateMe>some passages are not written too well if i remember right
(09:41:46)<purestrain>it works quite... but i can see one tile behind walls
(09:44:28)<purestrain>and its not compatible with bresenham for shooting :-(
(09:46:07)<RotateMe>there's no reason to not use classic raycasting at the borders of your fov
(09:46:24)<RotateMe>you can minimize errors with real easy techniques
(09:50:43)<purestrain>right... making the 3rd fow implementation; i've nothing else to do
(10:01:42)<RotateMe>purestrain, found the bug?
(10:02:01)<purestrain>no... i'm doing now plain raycasting
(10:02:33)<ido>what's up?
(10:03:01)<joe6pack>hey cakeboy. haven't seen you in a while
(10:03:05)<joe6pack>i *think*
(10:04:37)<joe6pack>btw, anyone interesting in taking over cryptrover?
(10:04:52)<joe6pack>s/interesting/interested 
(10:05:22)<RotateMe>you don't want to finish it yourelf?
(10:05:27)<joe6pack>surprsingly enough, there are still people downloading it everyday
(10:05:47)<joe6pack>it was finished after the first 7 days, as far as i am concerned 
(10:06:03)<joe6pack>all the core features are implemented, no major bugs
(10:06:27)<joe6pack>no it's just adding fluff and candy 
(10:06:33)<joe6pack>s/no/now
(10:06:42)<purestrain>raycasting sucks
(10:06:50)<purestrain>i want my z buffer :P
(10:06:56)<joe6pack>:|
(10:07:32)<purestrain>everything worked fine for now, except field of view
(10:07:44)<joe6pack>i was toying with adding all kind of stuff like bolld splatter and that sort of things
(10:07:49)<joe6pack>maybe new kinds of enemies 
(10:07:58)<joe6pack>or a couple of new items 
(10:08:27)<joe6pack>but really, i can't think of anything major i'd change 
(10:09:09)<RotateMe>well if not you, who else?
(10:09:09)<purestrain>4th algorithm.... now i try breshenham until the max radius cells
(10:09:26)<joe6pack>that was the 1st one i tried
(10:09:27)<RotateMe>isn't that raycasting?
(10:10:26)<purestrain>i tried it with real casts instead of breshenham
(10:10:41)<joe6pack>RotateMe: i'm just saying, if anyone wants it, it's there for the taking 
(10:11:59)<RotateMe>joe, you should post that on your website, i think everyone here is busy with his own projects
(10:12:44)<joe6pack>i think i'll hold on to it for a while longer then...
(10:14:16)<purestrain>whats an easy way to eleminate artifacts? i would say: if a tile is visible, the surrounding walls are visible too
(10:14:57)<joe6pack>i never needed to eliminate anything. plain ol' check if every cell is in the los works perfectly for me 
(10:14:59)<RotateMe>if a tile is visible make all tiles in the opposite direction of the player visible
(10:15:32)<joe6pack>if a tile is visible make all the tiles on the map visible 
(10:15:51)<RotateMe>so if a lit tile is above and left of the player make the tile left of it, the tile above it and the tile left-above it visible
(10:16:19)<RotateMe>replace left-above with the correct english term and you're done :D
(10:21:49)<RotateMe>have a look at this if you still have problems
(10:21:52)<RotateMe>http://jice.nospam.googlepages.com/visibilitydetermination
(10:22:03)<RotateMe>i got to get some sleep i got my 5th exam tomorrow
(10:22:12)<joe6pack>good luck

(06:24:25)<purestrain>good evening
(07:49:13)<joe6pack>that Space Marine 7drl makes me want to do a curses version of warcraft 1 :)
(07:49:37)<joe6pack>anyone knows of a site listing all the war1 units & their attributes?
(07:59:14)<purestrain>warcraft1... that was the _real_ warcraft
(07:59:59)<purestrain>i remember playing it against a friend over serial cable
(08:01:29)<joe6pack>i have found it on an abandonware site
(08:01:55)<joe6pack> but i would rather not got through it and document how many hitpoints etc each unit has...
(08:02:22)<joe6pack>i remember playing it at a friend's house when iit was newe
(08:22:31)<purestrain>i think after the next weekend i will stay on realtime instead of turnbased
(08:24:24)<purestrain>and i'll use opengl instead of plain sdl
(08:25:36)<purestrain>since that i won't even be a roguelike anymore
(08:28:03)<joe6pack>i think accelerated graphicsc are pretty much universally available these days
(08:28:16)<joe6pack>i'd use opengl regardless 
(08:28:45)<purestrain>my former target system was a handheld without opengl; but i don't get d running on it :-(

(09:12:36)<purestrain>i would like to make a remake of z, quite another interesting rts
(09:21:29)<joe6pack>i remember some game named z
(09:21:41)<joe6pack>iirc you didn't have to build buildings?
(09:21:59)<joe6pack>i just remember it was a bit different than dune 2/c&c/warcraft
(09:26:40)<purestrain>yes
(09:27:35)<joe6pack>mi didn't play it much at all
(09:28:12)<joe6pack>the ones i played a ton of were war2/c&c-red alert and i think total annihilation 
(09:28:24)<joe6pack>was that the one with the mechs?
(09:28:40)<joe6pack>anyway some game from 96 or 97
(09:28:51)<joe6pack>i was an rts fiend at that time
(09:31:40)<purestrain>up until the rts got more and more without the actual strategy ?
(09:48:30)<joe6pack>hrm? starcraft and warcraft 3 both contain quite a bit of strategy 
(09:48:36)<purestrain>uah... today i've got lots of map errors
(09:48:42)<purestrain>something is going wrong today
(09:49:23)<joe6pack>but yea, somewhere around that time there were ~3 years were rts's were very poplar and a lot of generic crappy ones were produced 
(09:55:39)<purestrain>is it within the 7drl rules if someone tests the game before finish ?
(09:55:51)<joe6pack>sure why not
(09:56:40)<purestrain>i would like to get a first opinion, do you mind and have a windows system running ?
(09:56:54)<joe6pack>i can use virtualbox
(09:57:15)<joe6pack>link?
(09:57:24)<joe6pack>or you can also email me
(09:57:34)<joe6pack>ido.yehieli@gmail.com
(09:58:00)<purestrain>i hope its fast enough ;-)
(09:58:20)<joe6pack>we will see :)
(09:58:27)<joe6pack>are you emailing me it?
(09:59:13)<purestrain>i'd better use a link, it will be faster
(09:59:33)<joe6pack>does it matter? i assume it is onlt a few kb
(09:59:44)<purestrain>2,7mb
(09:59:51)<joe6pack>ok
(10:00:06)<joe6pack> you can /msg me the link if you want
(10:00:13)<joe6pack>or post it publicly 
(10:00:16)<joe6pack>your choice 
(10:01:00)<joe6pack>oh finally, all the unit statistics for war1
(11:09:53)<joe6pack>anyone played this game: www.globulation2.org

(10:38:25)<oeb>They closed down a Space Hulk computer game last week
(10:38:42)<oeb>A few months ago they closed down a fan film that has been in development for years
(10:55:27)<cakeboy>way to alienate your fan base
(10:56:43)<TMC>a fan film?
(10:56:49)<TMC>any details about it?
(11:00:05)<oeb>Damantus or something it was called
(11:00:32)<oeb>If you search fan film or german in rec.games.minitures.warhammer something will probably show up
(11:01:12)<oeb>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnatus
(11:12:47)<oeb>cakeboy, yup. The fan film really was overkill though. The producers asked GW Germany, and they said 'Ya, sure no problem'. When the film was ready for release GW HQ said 'Hold on, germany can't approve that! KILL KILL KILL'
(11:19:37)<joe6pack>hi everyone 
(11:21:42)<TMC>hi
(11:21:43)<TMC>hmm
(11:21:54)<TMC>someone left the CIA bot running in #rln :P
(11:22:02)<joe6pack>i think i need to learn sdl
(11:22:11)<joe6pack>the time has come
(11:22:19)<joe6pack>for graphic game
(11:22:22)<joe6pack>s
(11:22:50)<TMC>it's easy but complex
(11:23:03)<TMC>portable but slightly inflexible
(11:23:07)<joe6pack>i think i will try to clone warcraft 1. it's as simple an rts i can think of that is still fun to play
(11:23:16)<joe6pack>what's complex about it?
(11:23:33)<TMC>well, I'm thinking of the video functions
(11:24:15)<TMC>which can be hard to match up correctly
(11:24:37)<TMC>SDL will let you blit anything to anything, but a mismatch can kill your fps
(11:24:47)<joe6pack>do you know of a better gfx lib?
(11:24:48)<TMC>also, the custom scancodes were a pain for me
(11:25:04)<TMC>no, haven't looked either
(11:25:10)<joe6pack>Keyboard scancodes?
(11:25:17)<TMC>you should be good enough for you
(11:25:18)<TMC>actually!
(11:25:23)<TMC>I can name a better one
(11:25:26)<TMC>pygame :P
(11:25:38)<joe6pack>pygame is an sdl wrapper...
(11:26:24)<TMC>I know
(11:26:27)<TMC>it's better
(11:26:45)<joe6pack>i rather program in c actually. that way i don't have to worry about performance. i can code most/all things in a naive way and it's usually fast enough
(11:26:50)<TMC>the goodness of python, plus extenstions
(11:26:59)<joe6pack>i remember trying an rl in python
(11:27:06)<joe6pack>maybe 4 years ago or so
(11:27:08)<joe6pack>maybe more
(11:27:21)<joe6pack>it started getting slow with pathfinding or fov 
(11:27:24)<TMC>naive approaches don't always work out when when dealing with graphics
(11:27:25)<joe6pack>or something like that
(11:27:41)<TMC>C doesn't help
(11:27:44)<joe6pack>well the graphic part will be quite small
(11:27:57)<joe6pack>i mean naive approches to stuff like pathfinding/ai/map generation/etc
(11:28:13)<joe6pack>worked for me till now,
(11:28:15)<joe6pack>of course
(11:28:24)<joe6pack>i have only been doing turn based games....
(11:28:31)<joe6pack>but anyway i like c
(11:28:35)<joe6pack>that's the main reason
(11:29:10)<joe6pack>what was particularly slow with sdl?
(11:29:11)<TMC>yeah
(11:29:54)<TMC>well I had to struggle to get a fullscreen app to run at above 20fps on a friends computer
(11:30:05)<TMC>all it did was paint approx 200 tiles to screen
(11:30:13)<joe6pack>huh
(11:30:16)<TMC>I finally got it to 60Hz
(11:30:26)<joe6pack>60fps is goodf 
(11:30:31)<TMC>but only at 16bpp and who knows what else
(11:30:39)<TMC>yeah
(11:30:58)<TMC>but most video options I tried ran at 15 or 5 fps :P
(11:31:15)<TMC>anyway
(11:31:32)<TMC>its definitely suitable
(11:31:46)<joe6pack>i don't care about that. for a war 1 clone i will be satisfied with 8 bit gfx, ~200 tiles which will not be updated every frame (only on screen scroll) and maybe 10-15 fps
(11:31:48)<TMC>I hate graphics programming
(11:31:58)<TMC>I always think I'm not doing it right
(11:32:04)<joe6pack>what was the resolution you tried?
(11:32:19)<TMC>640x480 I think
(11:32:32)<joe6pack>really? and it had problems displaying that?
(11:32:32)<TMC>or 800x600 probably
(11:32:38)<joe6pack>wierd 
(11:32:45)<TMC>well
(11:32:49)<joe6pack>did you use hardware acceleration? 
(11:32:54)<TMC>people make fast paced games with SDL
(11:33:07)<joe6pack>that's why i'm surprised 
(11:33:10)<TMC>and video players and all sorts of stuff
(11:33:21)<TMC>no, this was on a friends computer
(11:33:28)<TMC>I think it was an old one
(11:33:34)<TMC>I mean, it was
(11:33:47)<TMC>but I'd rather make games that play on old computers
(11:33:50)<joe6pack>it sounds like painting 200 tiles @ 800x600 should work fine even on a pentium II
(11:33:57)<TMC>I had no video card on this 8 year old computer
(11:34:04)<TMC>and my other one has a TNT2
(11:34:09)<joe6pack>huh
(11:34:10)<TMC>*have no
(11:34:19)<joe6pack>what kind of computer was that again?
(11:34:23)<joe6pack>more or less
(11:34:23)<TMC>was what
(11:34:28)<TMC>can't remember
(11:34:30)<TMC>wasn't mine
(11:34:32)<joe6pack>the one that ran too slow
(11:34:36)<TMC>about the same as this one
(11:34:50)<joe6pack>pentium? pentium2?
(11:34:52)<TMC>I don't think I managed to get 60Hz on this one
(11:36:26)<TMC>python can't be that slow if they're using it for the XO :P
(11:36:50)<joe6pack>just to get the order of magnitude, you said that 800x600/200 tiles/16bpp/60hz/software rendering on an ~8 years old computer worked?
(11:37:01)<joe6pack>the xo is very slow
(11:37:14)<joe6pack>i couldn't handle using it for more than a couple of minutes
(11:37:27)<joe6pack>everything takes forever. even the basic gui

(09:27:43)<joe6pack>so you are the stepfather, then?
(09:28:21)<purestrain>yep
(09:31:38)<joe6pack>nothing like looking for info on old games to make you realise there was once a time when the web was not obiquous

(03:22:06)<Glowie>For a roguelike?
(03:22:20)<ido>actually for my warcraft 1 clone :)
(03:22:40)<ido>but i think the setting is similar enough to be able to use the same tiles
(03:22:47)<Glowie>Oh :)
(03:23:00)<ido>do you know of any others?
(03:23:06)<ido>other than the ones i've listed?
(03:23:19)<Glowie>At least not any decent ones (in my opinion) :P
(03:23:30)<Glowie>I'm not into tiled roguelikes so I'm not up to date with tiles
(03:24:25)<ido>yea, me neither. the problem is, when i show anything i've made to people who don't play roguelikes adding graphics is often the 1st thing they ask about
(03:25:14)<ido>the good thing is that they've often also not seen the common rl tiles yet
(03:25:36)<ido>so i can use those and most people wouldn't know they're extremely overused :)
(03:26:37)<Glowie>Hehe
(03:26:40)<ido>graphics make a huge difference for a lot of casual (and none casual) players. sad but true 
(03:26:57)<ido>i like the 2d ones from crawl
(03:27:05)<Glowie>They do, but I just think it's their loss if they can't see the Beauty of the ASCII :P
(03:27:55)<ido>yes, but i am toying with the idea of try to get into the indie game making business eventually. 
(03:28:50)<ido>i know it isn't a very profitable market, but if i can scrape by for some time doing game development i'll be content 
(03:29:22)<Glowie>That's not an easy path I can assure you. An internet friend of mine released a new game (indie, small team, but well polished game with a price not too high) just a week ago and it was cracked+keygen'ed in LESS THAN A DAY :(
(03:29:37)<ido>heh
(03:29:45)<Glowie>I bet they weren't 'heh'
(03:30:01)<ido>well the people who pirate games aren't the same people who buy them
(03:30:15)<Glowie>True too
(03:31:04)<ido>i read something about that by the makers of "sins of a solar empire"
(03:31:10)<ido>let me try and find it 
(03:31:40)<jraregris>Chris Delay had an interesting piece on how to add value to actually buying the product over pirating it (example: WoW: you can pirate it and play single player, but not play on the servers))

(03:32:35)<ido>Glowie: link to the game?

(03:33:41)<Glowie>They're planning to lower the price and they might get to Steam too..
(03:34:31)<ido>oh wow
(03:34:34)<ido>looks very cool
(03:34:53)<ido>looks professional 
(03:35:26)<ido>is it any good?
(03:35:40)<Glowie>I've beta tested it and yes, it's addicting :P
(03:35:52)<ido>looks complicated
(03:36:05)<Glowie>The replay value of the game depends on the player really, not everyone like tower defense style games
(03:36:25)<Glowie>Not that complicated when you know how it works
(03:36:54)<ido>will you buy it?
(03:37:19)<Glowie>Not at least yet
(03:37:24)<ido>why not?
(03:37:58)<Glowie>I have enough things to do and games to play already (and I beta tested it so part of the replay value has already gone)
(03:38:11)<Glowie>Plus, if I'm going to buy it, it's going to be after the probable price reduction :P
(03:39:06)<RotateMe>psp?
(03:39:06)<ido>some friend you are ;)
(03:39:19)<RotateMe>(hi btw)
(03:39:31)<Glowie>An internet friend :b
(03:39:38)<Glowie>Hello at RotateMe
(03:39:54)<RotateMe>Glowie, you want to buy a psp or what?
(03:39:59)<Glowie>Nope
(03:40:21)<ido>RotateMe: http://www.oxeyegames.com/harvest/
(03:40:23)<Glowie>We were talking about indie games, and a game made by my friend when you came in
(03:40:29)<ido>that's what we were talking about
(03:40:53)<RotateMe>oh, i misread "probable price reduction :P"
(03:41:10)<RotateMe>just had a math exam and are still a bit weird :D
(03:41:31)<ido>it looks like a serious company 
(03:41:36)<ido>not a one man show
(03:41:55)<Glowie>Quite small but indeed very professional looking indie group
(03:42:07)<ido>how many people are they?
(03:43:14)<Glowie>Uhm.. Actually I'm not sure about the exact number, about 4-7 I think
(03:43:15)<RotateMe>looks cool, gonna try the demo
(03:43:22)<RotateMe>did you try it?
(03:43:24)<ido>hmm
(03:43:30)<Glowie>I've beta tested it
(03:43:42)<joe6pack>they are looking for a programmer 
(03:43:47)<joe6pack>http://www.oxeyegames.com/jobs/
(03:43:53)<Glowie>In Sweden
(03:44:08)<joe6pack>minor issue 
(03:44:33)<joe6pack>if i would have found a company i wanted to work for i would have gladely relocated 
(03:44:45)<joe6pack>i mean it depends to where, of course
(03:45:05)<RotateMe>http://www.fierz.ch/strategy.htm -> worth the link of the day?
(03:45:05)<joe6pack>but i would have no problem relocating to anywhere in the eu or north america
(03:45:30)<joe6pack>RotateMe: if you think it is, then it is :)
(03:46:18)<joe6pack>as far as i am concerned, if the current lotd is ~1 day old or more, you could replace it with whatever non-spam link you wish
(03:46:53)<joe6pack>if it is bad, someone else would just change it to something better
(03:47:03)<joe6pack>that's why everyone can change the subject on the channel 
(03:48:19)<joe6pack>interesting that they require a "# Portfolio of past game project that you have developed" from an intern 
(03:48:42)<RotateMe>why from an intern?
(03:48:49)<RotateMe>isn't it an open job description?
(03:48:49)<joe6pack>how many interns would actually have a portfolio to show? 
(03:49:01)<joe6pack>it says "Programmer Intern"
(03:49:29)<RotateMe>well maybe they suggest you did some more stuff in your freetime
(03:49:35)<Glowie>They are still new at being a company. I guess they really mean if the applicant has made games as a hobby and can show those
(03:49:40)<Glowie>Exactly
(03:49:43)<joe6pack>the whole point of being an "intern" and not just a "programmer"is that you have no experience 
(03:50:12)<joe6pack>what does that friend of your think of roguelikes? ;)
(03:50:36)<RotateMe>o||o? he couldn't concentrate long enough to play one
(03:50:53)<RotateMe>well he slashed his way through diablo 1 a few times now that i think about it
(03:51:16)<joe6pack>RotateMe: i was asking Glowie, i have no idea which friend you are talking about :)
(03:51:31)<RotateMe>sry
(03:51:36)<joe6pack>no problem
(03:51:41)<RotateMe>mp3 of the weak composer
(03:51:56)<Glowie>He knows the genre, has tried FD, but isn't a fan of the genre :P
(03:51:57)<RotateMe>i just posted it and you asked that's why i thought you meant him
(03:52:05)<joe6pack>ok
(03:52:24)<joe6pack>i didn't even see that you've changed that as well
(03:52:30)<RotateMe>k
(03:52:40)<joe6pack>will give it a go
(03:53:05)<RotateMe>man this job description sounds cool
(03:54:02)<joe6pack>is dungeonhunter your game?
(03:54:59)<RotateMe>yep
(03:55:14)<joe6pack>where did you take the tiles from?
(03:55:18)<RotateMe>it's not featuring that music or any music :D
(03:55:29)<RotateMe>rm2k chipsets
(03:55:46)<RotateMe>but most of them has been changed enough to be legal for a beta ^^
(03:56:02)<RotateMe>damn the graphics of dawn of daria look awesome
(03:56:08)<joe6pack>rm2k?
(03:57:27)<RotateMe>rpg maker 2000
(03:57:58)<RotateMe>well most of the tiles are from custom tilesets anyway and they again ripped it mostly from snes games
(03:59:03)<RotateMe>i'm currently working on ascii support
(03:59:15)<joe6pack>oh ok
(03:59:37)<RotateMe>it's nearly finished but i didn't work on my game the last few days (weaks?) hence the exams
(03:59:46)<joe6pack>RotateMe: i was searching for sources of free tiles
(03:59:52)<joe6pack>getquote tiles
(03:59:52)<null>tiles(0):  http://www.reinerstileset.4players.de:1059/englisch.htm
(03:59:52)<null>tiles(1):  http://pousse.rapiere.free.fr/tome/

(03:59:52)<null>tiles(3):  http://wiki.allegro.cc/Graphics_Depot
(03:59:53)<RotateMe>and of all my 9 hated subject i think i just fucked up maths, the only subject i liked
(04:00:06)<joe6pack>i ahve an exam on teusday 
(04:00:25)<joe6pack>and then hopfully some peace of mind due to Easter 
(04:00:42)<joe6pack>but this subject is a nice one
(04:00:51)<joe6pack>so i don't mind learning for that much
(04:00:56)<RotateMe>yep I'll have 3 exams to go (6 are over) which will be in monday, tuesday and wednesday
(04:01:18)<RotateMe>then i will get drunk enough to sleep 2 more days and then i have freetime for about 2 weaks
(04:01:25)<joe6pack>:)
(04:01:26)<RotateMe>in which i will do my 7drl
(04:01:41)<joe6pack>you sure know how to party ;)
(04:02:32)<RotateMe>... which lead to a photo of me throwing up at a party finding its way to my boss
(04:02:50)<joe6pack>so do you have any tiles link other than the 4 that are already there?
(04:02:59)<RotateMe>i'm just looking
(04:03:04)<joe6pack>i am sure he doesn't give a shit
(04:03:14)<joe6pack>if he is anything like any boss i've had 
(04:03:28)<RotateMe>well he can't do anything so i don't give a shit ;)
(04:03:44)<RotateMe>besides as i said i'm quitting and study maths in about juli
(04:03:51)<joe6pack>oh ok
(04:03:54)<joe6pack>good luck
(04:04:21)<joe6pack>but doesn't uni only begin at october?
(04:05:26)<RotateMe>problem is in order to apply for university i must not study at another university
(04:05:40)<RotateMe>applying starts in juli so i have to quit then
(04:06:07)<joe6pack>that's weird 
(04:06:08)<RotateMe>sadly i can't just quit uni and continue to work until my maths study starts
(04:06:20)<RotateMe>why?
(04:06:20)<joe6pack>in austria you can study in more than 1 uni at any given time
(04:06:36)<RotateMe>nope it's not possible here
(04:06:39)<joe6pack>i know a few people who study in both tuwien and uni wien
(04:06:45)<RotateMe>maybe it depends on the uni
(04:07:15)<joe6pack>so are you also moving to berlin in july? 
(04:07:23)<RotateMe>yep about then
(04:07:27)<joe6pack>cool
(04:07:51)<RotateMe>i can live at a friend's and from there i can find a living community (if that's what it's called)
(04:07:56)<RotateMe>wohngemeinschaft ;)
(04:08:10)<joe6pack>apartment? ;)
(04:08:23)<RotateMe>yeah an apartment where other students live
(04:08:40)<RotateMe>so you share a flat and share the costs
(04:08:50)<joe6pack>yes i know
(04:08:54)<joe6pack>i live in one atm
(04:08:59)<joe6pack>have been since i was 19
(04:09:11)<RotateMe>i guess it's much better then living alone
(04:09:22)<RotateMe>well you can have bad luck but i doubt that happens
(04:09:37)<RotateMe>seems most of the rm2k chipsets are rips from commercial games :(
(04:09:46)<joe6pack>i would have preferred living alone i think, but i can't afford it 
(04:10:02)<joe6pack>i know live with 1 other guy
(04:10:20)<joe6pack>but he works ~60 hours a week so it's not really a problem
(04:10:22)<deveah>hello
(04:10:28)<joe6pack>i barely notice he's here
(04:10:31)<joe6pack>hi deveah 
(04:10:40)<deveah>are the 1drls ready?

(04:11:47)<RotateMe>lazy people :P
(04:11:56)<joe6pack>or at least didn't get a lot of publicity yet :)
(04:11:59)<RotateMe>wow 60 hours a weak what does he do?
(04:12:16)<joe6pack>programmer in a very small start up company 
(04:12:27)<joe6pack>it's just him and i think 2 or 3 other guys
(04:12:42)<joe6pack>he often works on the weekend as well
(04:13:55)<RotateMe>does it go well?
(04:14:02)<joe6pack>i think so
(04:14:15)<RotateMe>so join them already :D
(04:14:17)<joe6pack>they have customers that are waiting for them to finish off development 
(04:14:26)<joe6pack>no thanks... 
(04:14:42)<joe6pack>i have neither the will nor the time to work that many hours 
(04:16:01)<RotateMe>yeah i'm already doing it and i'm quitting so i can understand why not doing so
(04:16:21)<joe6pack>and i want to finally finish off my studies as well
(04:16:24)<RotateMe>time in university is the peaceful time with 45 hours/weak and 9 exams
(04:16:36)<joe6pack>exactly :)
(04:16:43)<RotateMe>going to try this harvest game now
(05:03:30)<RotateMe>heh
(05:03:40)<RotateMe>got to wave 32 which is pretty bad i think#
(05:03:42)<RotateMe>was fun though
(05:05:18)<joe6pack>maybe i could contact some pixel artist who's work i liked and ask them how much they'd charge for some tiles & sprites
(05:11:08)<RotateMe>do you have something in mind?
(05:13:18)<joe6pack>you mean for the art? or what i want to use it for?
(05:13:53)<joe6pack>i was thinking pretty standard 32x32 tiles,
(05:14:24)<joe6pack>characters/grass/water/items/etc..
(05:17:45)<joe6pack>maybe i could get david e gervais ;)
(05:33:50)<deveah>beware of my dos gui :p
(05:38:02)<deveah>omg it's a lot of work...
(05:45:09)<deveah>simply addbutton, drawform, button properties, getbutton, getclicked
(06:47:17)<RotateMe>joe6pack, i meant what you want the tiles for?
(06:48:20)<joe6pack>RotateMe: a warcraft 1-like rts game
(06:56:34)<RotateMe>last time you wanted to do it in ascii
(06:57:24)<joe6pack>people don't give ascii the love it deserves :(
(06:57:42)<purestrain>you want to game a rts ?
(06:57:43)<RotateMe>yeah... but you think a wc1 like game would sell?
(06:57:59)<joe6pack>no, but it would get more people playng it
(06:58:16)<joe6pack>i will start off with fake ascii
(06:58:25)<joe6pack>i.e. sdl with ascii tiles
(06:58:50)<RotateMe>ah okay thought you'd want to sell it because you said maybe you'd pay for the pixel art
(06:59:12)<joe6pack>maybe i will...
(06:59:16)<joe6pack>pay that is
(06:59:18)<joe6pack>for good art
(06:59:30)<joe6pack>but that doesn't mean it will be sellable 
(06:59:43)<purestrain>donate game
(06:59:55)<joe6pack>the question is expensive the art would be 
(06:59:55)<purestrain>could be possible... i already donated to several games which i played frquently
(07:00:44)<joe6pack>purestrain: yea, if it turns out alright i might go that way, but i don't think it will actually bring in any significat revenue 
(07:00:52)<joe6pack>i do it for the experience 
(07:01:00)<joe6pack>and for fun
(07:01:03)<purestrain>right
(07:02:00)<purestrain>i'll start of with a new game too; but i don't want to make it in seven days ;-)

(07:02:32)<purestrain>id either thought about something like alien breed or something like Z
(07:02:43)<RotateMe>you can look through these and kindly ask the people who did this if you can use their graphics
(07:02:59)<RotateMe>the answer might be yes if you have something to show them
(07:03:21)<joe6pack>ok
(07:03:22)<joe6pack>thanks
(07:04:36)<joe6pack>http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/18998.htm
(07:04:41)<joe6pack>that's a good one :)
(07:04:51)<RotateMe>heh i liked that too
(07:04:53)<joe6pack>"brutus"...
(07:05:15)<RotateMe>brute is right in this case
(07:06:28)<RotateMe>oh sry it doesn't say that :D
(07:08:08)<RotateMe>http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/11203.htm
(07:08:14)<joe6pack>something like this one would be right:
(07:08:14)<joe6pack>http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/11203.htm
(07:08:16)<RotateMe>i think they might fit well
(07:08:21)<RotateMe>LOL!
(07:08:24)<joe6pack>:)
(07:08:34)<joe6pack>great minds think alike...
(07:08:50)<RotateMe>yep... ask that guy after you got some ascii stuff done
(07:09:00)<joe6pack>yea
(07:09:02)<RotateMe>i guess he'd even provide more stuff
(07:09:08)<joe6pack>that's a good idea
(07:09:42)<joe6pack>has practically all of the terrain, only needs more units 
(07:09:58)<joe6pack>and i guess a bit of movement animation
(07:10:17)<joe6pack>(and buildings)
(07:13:51)<joe6pack>http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/21609.htm
(07:15:35)<RotateMe>if this weren't cows and the enemies weren't chicken this could make a good game :D

(07:50:13)<purestrain>uah... if someone of these people at pixeljoin could help me for the roguelike :-)
(07:50:41)<joe6pack>the one i liked the most had no contact info :(
(07:53:12)<RotateMe_away>doesn't it have a pm system?
(07:53:51)<RotateMe_away>or comment on one of his pics
(07:53:54)<RotateMe_away>you might be lucky
(07:55:28)<joe6pack>when the time comes...
(07:55:41)<joe6pack>but his last post is from 2006, so i am not optimistic
(08:21:26)<joe6pack>hi there Aerton 
(08:23:29)<Aerton>hi there
(08:23:32)<Glowie>Evening Aerton
(08:23:55)<Glowie>Or perhaps early morning for you >_<
(08:24:10)<Glowie>Have you been crunching at work lately?
(08:24:13)<Aerton>midway from evening to morning ^^
(08:24:18)<Glowie>Hehe
(08:24:33)<Aerton>not today
(08:24:50)<Glowie>But the past week?
(08:25:06)<Aerton>yeah, I missed 7drl because of that :/
(08:25:44)<Glowie>I thought so :<
(08:26:20)<deveah>who needs commandprompt guis?
(08:26:33)<Glowie>What is a commandprompt gui?
(08:26:46)<Glowie>Command prompt + graphical user interface don't meet in my head
(08:28:45)<deveah>i *can* do that, but with basic-speed it would probably suck
(08:29:00)<deveah>textbox,label,button
(08:29:29)<Glowie>That's just weird :P
(08:29:48)<deveah>well visual basic for dos has those and looks kewl
(08:35:02)<joe6pack>there is also some curses based library (cdt?)  that does something like that
(08:35:43)<Aerton>there was borland turbo vision
(08:36:09)<Aerton>it's not command-prompt at all
(08:36:22)<Aerton>just a gui
(08:36:56)<joe6pack>yea, just implemented with ascii 
(09:33:23)<jomiolto>hello beautiful people :)
(09:44:12)<purestrain>hello
(09:45:52)<jomiolto>finally got around to making a roguebasin page for Alan's Psychedelic Journey
(09:51:27)<jomiolto>hmm, there's going to be a lot of fresh roguelikes to try out if the 7drl contest has a good success rate
(09:51:56)<purestrain>try my aborted one and tell me if it runs at least ;-) if you have windows, of course
(09:52:36)<jomiolto>hmm, well, I do have Vista, but I'm too lazy to boot to it right now, but I'll try it again later (if i remember, that is)
(09:52:58)<jomiolto>which one is it?
(09:53:20)<purestrain>http://retroforge.de/%7Emd/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/residentevil.png <- this one, the zombie roguelike
(09:54:47)<jomiolto>okay, I downloaded it and I'll try it when I boot to windows
(09:55:36)<purestrain>its very well balanced... i actually finished the game with only one enemy encounter
(09:55:43)<purestrain>zombies take far to long for reanimation
(09:56:07)<purestrain>and i forgot to make the clip size smaller... 150 shots / clip was for debugging only :-)
(09:56:47)<jomiolto>it looks quite interesting :)

(10:57:28)<joe6pack>and now 5 :)
(10:57:31)<RotateMe>they are hawt
(10:57:55)<RotateMe>thought you had added the tiles you might use for your wc1-like
(10:58:27)<joe6pack>these weren't really tiles though, just some sketches 
(10:58:47)<joe6pack>i mean they were not in a format you could just drop in a game
(11:00:02)<RotateMe>not?
(11:00:21)<joe6pack>not the ones from that pixel art website at least 
(11:00:28)<RotateMe>the second file with the pink-ish background
(11:00:38)<RotateMe>i would use them like this to add them to a game
(11:00:41)<joe6pack>yea, but these were very few tiles
(11:00:50)<joe6pack>only a couple of units
(11:00:54)<deveah>i think numbers si a great 7drl
(11:01:20)<joe6pack>anyway you can it if you'd like
(11:01:28)<joe6pack>"can add it"
(11:10:27)<RotateMe>shouldn't most of the 7drls be finished today or when did they all start?

(11:26:38)<RotateMe>the 7drls are finished \o/
(11:26:44)<joe6pack>yay
(11:26:45)<RotateMe>many failures and runaways though
(11:26:53)<joe6pack>that's ok
(11:27:01)<joe6pack>which have you played?
(11:27:06)<joe6pack>i had time for none

(11:47:19)<joe6pack>not enough of them
(11:47:32)<joe6pack>a complete game would need a few more

(11:49:15)<RotateMe>i'm going to pretend to be that guy and steal your money
(11:49:22)<RotateMe>did i say that aloud?
(11:49:36)<joe6pack>if you provide the tile i wouldn't mind ;)
(11:50:11)<joe6pack>that's why you don't pay all the money up front in these things :)
(11:50:36)<RotateMe>sure :(
(11:51:30)<joe6pack>i really like his work. these are some of the best tiles i've seen
(11:51:46)<joe6pack>at least as good as geravis'
(11:52:00)<joe6pack>or "gervais" 
(11:52:07)<joe6pack>or however you spell his name
(11:52:10)<RotateMe>yeah his tiles are very cool
(11:53:22)<joe6pack>hrm
(11:53:34)<joe6pack>i wonder how would warcraft feel like as a turn based game
(11:54:04)<joe6pack>kind of like an action oreinted civilisation, i guess
(11:54:34)<MadCacti>oh, 7drl!
(11:57:13)<RotateMe>well the maps would need to be much smaller and things like resource collecting should be done automatically
(11:57:27)<joe6pack>why?
(11:57:30)<RotateMe>(just say how many % should go for woods/gold)
(11:57:56)<RotateMe>if you would have to say them every turn: advance one step, hack this would some more etc. it would be no fun
(11:58:09)<joe6pack>i meant turn based like fallout, where each turn a unit can make several steps
(11:58:29)<RotateMe>well but what are your options for peons...
(11:58:54)<RotateMe>especially in wc1 they did nothing but collecting or fleeing if i remember right
(11:58:58)<joe6pack>the interface would be the same as it is now. in warcraft you don't tell them to advance 1 step. you tell them to harverst lumber and they do it themselves
(11:59:12)<joe6pack>ok, maybe the ai can a bit smarter
(11:59:20)<joe6pack>but in principle
(11:59:28)<RotateMe>so the game just pauses after a few steps and then the enemies move?
(11:59:40)<joe6pack>did you plat fallout?
(11:59:44)<RotateMe>yep
(11:59:46)<joe6pack>same
(11:59:49)<RotateMe>k
(12:00:16)<joe6pack>you will have action points to each unit
(12:00:19)<RotateMe>does the ai in fallout continue commands on its own?
(12:00:36)<RotateMe>like going for wood?
(12:00:41)<RotateMe>that's what i meant
(12:00:51)<joe6pack>in fallout you only ctrl one character
(12:01:24)<joe6pack>but in a turn based warcraft i will think it should; just like it does in the real warcraft
(12:01:48)<RotateMe>k that's what i thought, it would get nasty to tell them the same stuff every turn
(12:02:15)<joe6pack>yes. there is no reason to do it that way.
(12:02:28)<RotateMe>and maybe you could do this even more by automatically assigning a new unit to get wood / gold depending on some ratio the user has set
(12:02:57)<joe6pack>why? if anything you have more time to handle this things that in a rts
(12:03:39)<joe6pack>in war|starcraft it is part of the difficulty, to manage the base and not just the army 
(12:03:43)<RotateMe>i never get why this doesn't exist in rts, so i want YOU to add it :)
(12:03:53)<joe6pack>:)
(12:04:13)<joe6pack>there is at least 1 rts that does it the way you want it to
(12:04:20)<joe6pack>or at least somehow
(12:04:30)<joe6pack>don't remember the name; but it is open source
(12:04:37)<RotateMe>quake 3
(12:04:40)<RotateMe>:D
(12:05:06)<RotateMe>well if not there should be some interesting stuff for resources
(12:05:15)<joe6pack>i think a solution to that would be to make things cheaper so that you don't need to have more than 4-5 peons
(12:05:21)<RotateMe>not just, oh no wood there anymore, so go there
(12:05:55)<joe6pack>yes, but that's the difference between civ and war/starcraft - you handle the micro not only the macro
(12:06:31)<joe6pack>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulation_2
(12:06:40)<RotateMe>well no macro stuff, just burning woods or mining accidents or sth.
(12:06:47)<joe6pack>"Globulation 2 is a real-time strategy game which minimizes the amount of micromanagement present in the game by automatically assigning tasks to units."
(12:06:59)<RotateMe>insta-win
(12:07:31)<RotateMe>aside from the unit graphics it looks cool
(12:07:39)<RotateMe>letters would have been a better choice
(12:07:51)<joe6pack>i don't know. it looks cute
(12:08:52)<joe6pack>my problem is that it's not obvious what each unit is doing by it's apperance. if you see a guy with a sword and a guy with an axe chopping wood it's quite apperant that the 1st is a melle warrior and the 2nd a worker
(12:09:15)<joe6pack>and a gut with a bow is a ranged warrior 
(12:09:17)<joe6pack>etc.
(12:09:21)<joe6pack>s/gut/guy
(12:10:55)<RotateMe>i think they only have current tasks, no set jobs
(12:11:03)<joe6pack>try it
(12:11:22)<RotateMe>last exam tomorrow, then there's time for stuff like this
(12:11:34)<joe6pack>i don't know. but i know their goal is to minimize micromanagment, which is what you were talking about
(12:11:38)<joe6pack>:)
(12:11:51)<RotateMe>bookmarked
(12:12:45)<RotateMe>http://www.dobbschallenge.com/?cid=banner_game found this yesterday
(12:13:05)<RotateMe>as i said, it's m$ but still, you can win 10.000 friggin dollars
(12:13:23)<RotateMe>and the idea itself is not bad i think
(12:14:04)<joe6pack>interesting 
(12:14:20)<RotateMe>well anyways, back to business economics
(12:14:26)<joe6pack>have fun

(04:43:12)<sinoth>aye
(04:43:41)<joe6pack>do you post under another nick on the newes group?
(04:44:30)<sinoth>nope just sinoth

(04:46:06)<joe6pack>chrysalis
(04:46:33)<joe6pack>haven't tried it yet 
(04:46:37)<joe6pack>too many exams 
(04:47:37)<sinoth>was fun to do, my first roguelike xD
(04:48:28)<sinoth>definitely got me better equipped for the next 7drl
(04:48:37)<joe6pack>never tried pair programming a rl
(04:48:43)<joe6pack>or any game, for that matter
(04:48:53)<joe6pack>only at work, when i had to...
(04:49:44)<joe6pack>btw
(04:49:51)<joe6pack>you forgot to chmod +x the bin
(04:49:53)<sinoth>it's fun, but programming a lot at work can take away from it
(04:50:00)<sinoth>whoops :o
(04:50:00)<joe6pack>and you are also buzy waiting :(
(04:50:23)<joe6pack>anyway the startup screen is taking 100% cpu...
(04:50:25)<sinoth>yep, i love eating those CPU cycles
(04:50:46)<sinoth>i'll keep that in mind for the next entry though, forgot to add in some sleeps
(04:50:58)<joe6pack>i don't appreciate it, since my laptop scales down the cpu frequency (and therefor the fan)
(04:51:14)<joe6pack>not that big of a deal though
(04:52:25)<joe6pack>looks nice
(04:52:50)<sinoth>thanks :) unfortunately there is not a ton of gameplay, it is more of a tech demo
(04:52:55)<joe6pack>but a bit difficult to understand 
(04:53:34)<joe6pack>for instance, what allocating each point  will do
(04:53:46)<sinoth>yea, i really should have packaged a readme
(04:54:06)<sinoth>although i did want the player to have to experiment to see what body part does what
(04:54:30)<joe6pack>also
(04:54:38)<joe6pack>how do i know how many hp i have
(04:55:01)<joe6pack>and what are the green 'z's?
(04:55:18)<sinoth>you can hit 'x' to look at things
(04:55:43)<sinoth>and for now you have to hit 'i' to see HP... very bad, i know, but i couldn't think of a clever, unobtrusive way to show HP
(04:55:49)<joe6pack>would also be nice if the world generation would work faster
(04:56:13)<joe6pack>just a normal label somewhere, like all other games 
(04:56:32)<sinoth>i liked that the main game screen had no UI on it though
(04:56:52)<sinoth>maybe a HP display that only pops up when you are hurt
(04:57:40)<joe6pack>what do the different tile colors represent? 
(04:57:50)<sinoth>different terrain
(04:57:57)<sinoth>you can hit 'x' to see what kind of terrain it is
(04:58:07)<sinoth>grass, rock, sand, etc
(04:58:24)<joe6pack>ok
(04:58:53)<joe6pack>nice, but needs to be more of an actuall game to hold my interest any further :)
(04:59:21)<sinoth>i understand :) next 7DRL i will concentrate more on gameplay, less on tech
(04:59:36)<sinoth>i was just happy to get something working
(04:59:53)<joe6pack>yes that's a good start
(05:02:04)<joe6pack>i'm toying with the idea of making a simplified turn based warcraft-like clone 
(05:02:39)<joe6pack>but i don't think i really have time for it this semester... i should really spend a bit more time on uni
(05:03:06)<sinoth>i am thinking of the same thing, i think it would be fun
(05:03:16)<sinoth>just hard to execute well
(05:03:29)<sinoth>the interface will be a big issue
(05:03:31)<joe6pack>yea, but that would be quite a bit more complex than a rl
(05:03:45)<joe6pack>no, i think for the interface i can just copy warcraft's
(05:04:02)<joe6pack>ai is what i worry about
(05:04:59)<sinoth>wouldn't the pathing be very similar to existing RL pathfinding?
(05:05:58)<joe6pack>in a strategy game pathfinding is only one part of the ai
(05:06:21)<joe6pack>there is also resource allocation/gathering, when to attack, how to attack, when to defend...
(05:06:26)<joe6pack>etc,etc...
(05:06:42)<joe6pack>i think pathfinding will not be the biggest hurdle 
(06:26:05)<joe6pack>the zerg trail;er is awesome 
(06:26:13)<joe6pack>http://www.starcraft2.com/movies.xml
(06:28:24)<purestrain>crap... downloading a downloader to download a movie ...
(06:28:38)<joe6pack>yea i don't like that part either
(06:28:49)<joe6pack>it's a peer-to-peer thing
(06:33:24)<purestrain>hmmm.... i think i need a second harddrive
(06:33:30)<purestrain>i would like to install ubuntu
(06:33:56)<RotateMe_away>wtf why doesn't the zerg trailer appear in the dls for me?
(06:33:58)<joe6pack>why do you need a 2nd drive for that?
(06:34:08)<joe6pack>just make a new partition 
(06:34:32)<joe6pack>RotateMe_away: it's called "Zerg Reveal Trailer"
(06:34:32)<purestrain>i have not much free diskspace
(06:34:38)<joe6pack>in the movies section
(06:34:58)<RotateMe_away>it's not there plus everything is in german :(
(06:35:02)<RotateMe_away>which might be the reason
(06:35:09)<joe6pack>maybe :)
(06:35:10)<RotateMe_away>protos terrans
(06:35:14)<RotateMe_away>cinematic
(06:35:16)<joe6pack>change ot english
(06:35:25)<joe6pack>there is a thingy at the top right corner
(06:36:02)<RotateMe_away>theeeere it is
(06:36:41)<RotateMe>fast is something else :(
(06:36:54)<joe6pack>i hope that by the time sc2 come out i will have enough money to buy a new computer that could run it 
(06:37:08)<joe6pack>yea it takes a while
(06:37:10)<RotateMe>i hope the movie dls will be finished by then
(06:37:13)<joe6pack>mine says 50 mins
(06:37:28)<RotateMe>just watched the end of there will be blood
(06:37:36)<RotateMe>pretty awesome movie
(06:37:39)<joe6pack>only the end?
(06:37:53)<RotateMe>no i couldn't watch the whole movie the first time
(06:37:53)<joe6pack>yea it's a good one
(06:38:24)<RotateMe>it's weird how fast things change when the movie is near the end
(06:38:44)<joe6pack>yes
(06:39:04)<RotateMe>son learns to speak, son leaves, daniel kills eli in three scenes
(06:39:36)<joe6pack>the setting also turns from wild west to modern pretty quickly 
(06:40:32)<joe6pack>i mean you don't realy expect cowboys and those sorts to have milkshakes and bowling...
(06:48:03)<RotateMe>heh ^^
(06:48:09)<RotateMe>wonder what the book is like
(06:48:20)<RotateMe>maybe i will read it but i guess it's olde
(06:51:32)<RotateMe>which means it might be hard to get
(06:53:10)<joe6pack>the usually do reprints of books who were recently made into block busters
(06:54:30)<purestrain>well, it looks good, but it will be a 0815 rts
(06:54:46)<joe6pack>0815?
(06:55:25)<joe6pack>what does 8 translate into in 1337 again?
(06:55:38)<purestrain>ehm... its a german idiom for 'average'
(06:56:05)<joe6pack>i highly doubt starcraft 2 will be average 
(06:56:28)<joe6pack>i expect it to be the best rts around, just like it's predecessors 
(06:56:44)<purestrain>its just another clickfest
(06:56:53)<purestrain>nothing strategic beside total war
(06:57:12)<purestrain>no politics, espionage... no diplomacy
(06:57:40)<purestrain>button sitting :-)
(06:57:56)<joe6pack>well that's not that kind of game. it's like complaining that simcity doesn't have grenade lunchers 
(06:58:18)<purestrain>yeah, so its just another 0815 rts
(06:58:26)<joe6pack>and if you've ever played starcraft or warcraft 3 you'd know there's a lot of skill in it
(06:58:28)<purestrain>with better graphics of course
(06:58:37)<purestrain>i own starcraft :-)
(06:58:38)<joe6pack>you have to think fast
(06:58:49)<joe6pack>act fast, and not panic
(06:58:49)<purestrain>and click even faster
(06:59:01)<joe6pack>yes that's part of it, but not the only part
(06:59:01)<Glowie>RTSes aren't really about strategy. The genre's name is misleading
(06:59:11)<Glowie>But that doesn't make it any less fun
(06:59:12)<purestrain>i'm more in love of 'hearts of iron 2'
(06:59:18)<joe6pack>real time tactics 
(06:59:28)<Glowie>Diplomacy is for turn based games
(06:59:39)<Glowie>RTT is a genre of its own I think
(06:59:54)<purestrain>hoi2 is realtime, but features also diplomacy
(07:00:11)<Glowie>I know, but diplomacy doesn't really fit in real time environment
(07:00:20)<joe6pack>well it does have some strategy, but it's mostly tactics in the sense that micro is much more dominant that macro
(07:00:26)<Glowie>Real time cuts the strategic thinking of diplomacy
(07:00:40)<Glowie>Yep, ido
(07:01:33)<purestrain>so we all agree, and thats what i say: average rts
(07:01:44)<Glowie>Nope.
(07:01:47)<purestrain>or is there any feature which has not yet implemented in any other rts?
(07:01:53)<Glowie>You don't seem to know what an RTS is if you call it average
(07:02:21)<Glowie>Are new features a must to be better than average?
(07:02:22)<joe6pack>purestrain: how can we know if it isn't out yet?
(07:02:34)<purestrain>glowie, so what makes it superior ?
(07:03:05)<Glowie>The excellent balance, the amount of skill one needs to be really good, the fun gameplay and replay value thanks to 3 distinct races for example?
(07:03:14)<Glowie>And the overall excellence of a Blizzard product
(07:03:32)<purestrain>same as starcraft 1 i think ?
(07:03:40)<Glowie>Pretty much
(07:03:42)<Glowie>Does that make it worse?
(07:03:51)<purestrain>does that make it better ?
(07:04:09)<Glowie>Not necessarily, but I'd be surprised if it was better than the best RTS world has seen
(07:04:12)<joe6pack>as i see it blizzard isn't about inovation, it's about taking an existing genre and polishing it to perfection 
(07:04:23)<Glowie>Works well for them
(07:04:29)<joe6pack>you mean if it wasn't
(07:04:42)<Glowie>Nope, I mean if it was
(07:04:49)<Glowie>Starcraft is near to the perfect RTS
(07:04:49)<joe6pack>purestrain: i expect it to be a big incremental improvement 
(07:04:54)<purestrain>so polishing consisted only in graphics, if its almost the same as starcraft 1
(07:05:08)<joe6pack>purestrain: no
(07:05:13)<Glowie>Different game mechanics makes it a different game
(07:05:17)<Glowie>You sound very ignorant.
(07:05:23)<purestrain>i call z the perfect rts (if we talk about the clickfest rts ) ;-)
(07:05:33)<joe6pack>and you are talking out of you ass, because the game is not out yet so none of us have any idea what it doese and doesn't do
(07:05:58)<purestrain>i didn't start this discussion, i only told its an average rts
(07:06:29)<joe6pack>i think you are confusing the words "average" and "ordinary" 
(07:06:49)<Glowie>It's not even ordinary if its balance is better than 99% of other RTSes
(07:06:56)<purestrain>yeah perhaps... average was just a fast selfmade translation of 0815
(07:07:33)<joe6pack>average == durchschnittlich
(07:08:55)<purestrain>hmm... generic, normal, orinarily, plain, standard, usual ;-)
(07:09:24)<purestrain>if starcraft would feature supply lines, or some sort of push/retreat combat mechanics, i would call it superior
(07:09:30)<Glowie>Not any of those overall. Some features maybe, but even 3 distinct races isn't ordinary for an RTS
(07:09:44)<purestrain>dawn of war has 7 iirc
(07:09:52)<Glowie>And look at the balance :)
(07:09:56)<Glowie>It's a horrible mess
(07:10:07)<Glowie>Sorry, 3 well balanced races*
(07:10:35)<purestrain>balance is such a terrible term... what is balanced? if i could buy 100 soldiers for 1 tank at the same price, and they would equally kill each other ?
(07:10:55)<joe6pack>anyway, i agree that most if not all of blizzard's games are not revolutionary, but being the best through incremental improvment and attention to detail is importnat as well
(07:10:57)<Glowie>It's not as simple as that
(07:11:13)<Glowie>Balance is that nothing is overpowered or underpowered
(07:11:26)<purestrain>i know thats not that simple... but take into account that starcraft 1 is years old, and i took years to make it balanced
(07:11:27)<joe6pack>purestrain: take 2 given people of the same level, one plays one race the other another.
(07:11:49)<joe6pack>in a balandced game both will have the same chance of winning
(07:12:30)<joe6pack>purestrain: starcraft came out in 98. in 99 it was already perfectly balanced or very close to it
(07:13:05)<purestrain>huh? i noticed years after the community complaining about gameplay issues
(07:13:22)<joe6pack>the always complain. i am sure they still complain to this day
(07:14:18)<Epyon|Hungover>purestrain, still the current StarCraft's champion race of choice is... "Random" :P
(07:15:16)<joe6pack>they do the same in warcraft 3
(07:15:21)<purestrain>of course my favourite race in warcraft3 is random too
(07:15:22)<joe6pack>OMG human IMBA!!!!!!
(07:15:27)<joe6pack>or whatever
(07:15:56)<purestrain>in dawn of war i usually use the space marines or necrons, since i love them :-)
(07:16:09)<Glowie>Death to the false Emperor!
(07:16:26)<Epyon|Hungover>Death to alcohol!
(07:16:35)<Glowie>:P
(07:17:04)<purestrain>so, of course i think sc2 will be a very successfull game, but i stay at my opinion that the game is nothing new, nothing really superior compared to others
(07:18:02)<Glowie>For you a game needs something new to be better than average?
(07:18:30)<joe6pack>i think this is a good time to leave this conversation behind... 
(07:18:45)<Glowie>The roof isn't burning yet :<
(07:19:23)<sinoth>wow, spirited conversation xD
(07:19:35)<Glowie>Not really, just a conversation :)
(07:19:47)<Glowie>I like debating
(07:20:13)<sinoth>i think sc2 will be a badass game, but i see where purestrain is coming from with "nothing new".  it may be the best RTS, but it doesn't change the genre much
(07:20:43)<Glowie>That isn't Blizzard's goal, but it's true
(07:21:13)<sinoth>right.. they don't need to make anything new
(07:21:21)<sinoth>gamers are content with new eyecandy 
(07:21:34)<joe6pack>it's not just eyecandy :p
(07:21:48)<joe6pack>it's evolution 
(07:21:49)<Glowie>You make it sound like it's just a copy of the original with new graphics. There's still new game mechanics with new units etc
(07:21:56)<sinoth>sc2 does look more massive in nature
(07:22:01)<sinoth>more units on screen, etc
(07:22:02)<Glowie>Just not that many new revolutionary features
(07:22:16)<sinoth>zerg video was so awesome.  i love me some zerg
(07:22:47)<joe6pack>blizzard are like the toyota of the game industry 
(07:23:02)<joe6pack>"continuous improvements" and all that 
(07:23:11)<purestrain>new units, new graphics... but i would really like to see supply lines, better combat mechanics (instead of i shoot you and you shoot me), a of course another goal as just 'total war' as the only strategic decision.... but yeah, better stop now
(07:23:38)<sinoth>i agree about supply lines and combat, but i'm not sure what you mean about "another goal"
(07:23:40)<Glowie>I can't see why it's better stop now, we aren't insulting each other or anything :)
(07:24:13)<sinoth>what do you see as alternate goals?  i mean AoE had stuff like, build a wonder, but i never liked that mode :P
(07:24:17)<joe6pack>diplomacy does make sense in an rts. an rts is about combat 
(07:24:27)<Glowie>Those ideas you mentioned might not work with Starcraft
(07:24:29)<joe6pack>s/does/doesn't
(07:24:35)<purestrain>rts in the term as it is evolved today
(07:25:02)<joe6pack>rts as it always was, all the way back to its foundations in dune 2 
(07:25:24)<Glowie>Agree. Gotta love Dune 2
(07:25:40)<purestrain>there were others, but not really successfull... like enemy nations or rise of nations
(07:25:43)<joe6pack>every rts we see now still has dune 2 at it's core
(07:25:55)<Glowie>But diplomacy works A LOT better in long turn based and preferably pbem games
(07:26:03)<purestrain>dune1 was a strategy game too
(07:26:14)<purestrain>with some rpg/adventure elements :-)
(07:26:16)<joe6pack>dune 1 was not an rts
(07:26:53)<joe6pack>it's like saying tetris sucks because it's only about falling blocks. falling blocks are the essence of tetris
(07:27:15)<joe6pack>if you want macro, play a master of orion or civ
(07:27:42)<purestrain>joe6packs, it would not be about tetris... it would be about tetris2 which i say it sucks, if it has only 3d graphcis
(07:28:04)<joe6pack>but sc2 will be more than just sc with pretty gfx
(07:28:25)<purestrain>perhaps... but in this conversation i got no point which makes it unique
(07:28:54)<joe6pack>but we already agreed that "unique" isn't blizzards goal 
(07:29:05)<purestrain>yes
(07:29:08)<Glowie>To me near perfect balance is unique :P
(07:29:12)<purestrain>and thats what i say its ordinary
(07:29:42)<joe6pack>that was not the point of contention; the point of contention is that you imply it means it is not worth while
(07:31:01)<joe6pack>i don't expect my 2008 toyota (if i had one) to be unique realtive to a 2001 toyta either. i'll be happy if it gets better milage and is more comfortable to drive 
(07:31:12)<purestrain>for me its true... for every game who likes polished up established games its ok... i'll never understand why someone bought fifa, fifa95, fifa96, fifa97, fifa2008
(07:32:07)<purestrain>Joe6bot, thats a different thing, isn't it? games are more about creativity
(07:32:23)<joe6pack>me neither, but that's because generally fifa n+1 really is just fifa n with better gfx. notice that new blizzard rts's don't come evrey year but every 5 years
(07:32:40)<joe6pack>purestrain: Joe6bot hasn't achived sentience as of yet
(07:32:51)<joe6pack>and no, they aren't 
(07:32:55)<joe6pack>they're about fun
(07:33:27)<joe6pack>of course it's nice if it's also creative 
(07:33:34)<Aerton>new fifa are basically the database updates
(07:34:12)<Glowie>Does joe6bot have a rand 1-100 or similar feature?
(07:34:21)<joe6pack>yes

(07:37:44)<purestrain>the most recent nice feature of rts was to leave the solider-level and operate on squad-level; at least for me :-)
(07:38:10)<Aerton>recent? Oo
(07:38:14)<purestrain>instead of sudden strike... there i had to tell the officer where to look at
(07:38:26)<sinoth>i dunno, i kinda liked how Warrior Kings handled that issue.  units started as single soldiers, but you could group them how you wanted and form squads, and command them as one
(07:38:34)<joe6pack>i think it all has it's place. games as an art and games as a pastime 
(07:38:48)<Glowie>Games as competitive sport \o/
(07:39:09)<joe6pack>that too
(07:39:12)<Aerton>actually, squad-level was more common before the genre felt into cloning warcraft/c&c
(07:39:32)<joe6pack>when was that?
(07:40:07)<purestrain>aerton, yes... but only for performance reasons :-) there is no difference between commanding a soldier and a squad of 100 soldiers which actually are a single unit too ;-)
(07:40:11)<Aerton>Siege, Warhammer: shadow of the horned rat, ambush of sorior and others
(07:40:24)<joe6pack>hmm
(07:40:46)<Aerton>all of these had 1:1 figure/soldier ratio
(07:41:05)<joe6pack>i actually left the rts scene after total annihilation or so, and only came back when some friends of mine started playing war3 in the university's computer rooms
(07:41:19)<purestrain>but they did not operate as a single soldier, did they? i never saw someone out of formation...
(07:41:57)<Aerton>they operated as squads
(07:44:10)<joe6pack>i actually think really unique games come very seldomly. maybe once every couple of years. and if they are successful enough they become their own general 
(07:44:14)<joe6pack>genre 
(07:45:32)<purestrain>maybe... or a bad mixture of existing genres... even worse are games which mix two different worlds :-)
(07:45:47)<purestrain>like 3d shooter and rts
(07:46:03)<Aerton>I guess they are more common, if you'll include unsuccessful, but unique attempts
(07:48:24)<purestrain>some day someone will hopefully write my deam rts :-) controlling armies, directing supply lines, strategic bombing, strategic retreats of armies, encircling and so on
(07:49:16)<Glowie>Make it yourself and become rich \o/
(07:49:30)<purestrain>no one wants to play it, i already made several polls :-(
(07:49:33)<sinoth>hey now, no hating on 3d shooter + RTS.  savage is great
(07:49:45)<purestrain>everyone wants games like sc2 :-/
(07:49:51)<Aerton>I guess it's easier to find such features in a tbs
(07:49:56)<Glowie>:P
(07:50:10)<Aerton>sc2? star control 2?
(07:50:16)<Glowie>Starcraft 2
(07:50:23)<Glowie>That's what we were talking about when you walked in
(07:50:44)<Aerton>awww...
(07:50:56)<Aerton>ppl here are crazy about it ^^

(08:00:20)<joe6pack>any suggestions for other good dev. communities on the web?
(08:01:09)<Aerton>I guess there is no community like rgrd
(08:01:25)<Aerton>although I would like to be proven wrong
(08:04:54)<joe6pack>i havn't really been looking that hard, to tell you the truth 
(08:05:44)<joe6pack>but the few game dev forums i've looked at seemed to be populated by rather immature people
(08:16:25)<purestrain>gamedev net?
(08:16:40)<purestrain>i know some german ones

(05:17:47)<TMC>no link of the day? :(
(09:36:04)<joe6pack>hrm
(09:36:21)<joe6pack>was the topic removed again?
(09:38:04)<MadCacti>hi

(09:47:01)<MadCacti>even the backgrounds and shirts are nearly the same colour :P
(09:52:19)<joe6pack>?
(09:54:59)<joe6pack>god, they sure make installing spring a pain in the ass
(09:55:20)<joe6pack>would be nice to provide a link to the mods download
(09:58:18)<MadCacti>it's interesting
(09:58:29)<MadCacti>*sounds interesting
(09:58:41)<MadCacti>I'm tempted to investigate the source
(10:01:28)<joe6pack>they seem to be extremely windows oriented

(04:40:39)<deveah>hello ppl
(04:40:46)<joe6pack>hi deveah 
(04:41:01)<deveah>what new rls are there?
(04:41:26)<joe6pack>many
(04:41:30)<joe6pack>all the 7drl's
(04:41:37)<deveah>and why aren't cryptrover and fridge in the completed list???????
(04:42:23)<joe6pack>they were not part of the challenge 
(04:42:30)<joe6pack>they were both made before it 
(04:42:37)<deveah>no?!?!??! wtf!F!!!!!
(04:43:00)<joe6pack>yes, the challange was last week...
(04:43:23)<deveah>i know, but i specially made fridge because i knew i hadn't got time for it last weeekekekk!K!!
(04:43:24)<joe6pack>march 8-15 iirc
(04:43:34)<joe6pack>kekekekekeke
(04:43:53)<joe6pack>where did you see this list anyway
(04:44:01)<deveah>roguetemple
(04:45:02)<joe6pack>then write slash an email about it if you think he should mention them
(04:45:24)<deveah>i sure will!!! what's his email?
(04:46:17)<deveaho>icechat sukks
(04:47:19)<joe6pack>deveaho: java.koder@gmail.com
(04:47:40)<deveaho>thanks
(04:52:21)<deveaho>sent
(04:58:44)<deveaho>boxedirc looks nice
(05:10:33)<jomiolto>heh, that lotd tetris looks very much like the one we did for hugi size coding competition some years back
(05:11:21)<jomiolto>perhaps one day I should try to write a roguelike in something like 4k
(05:11:33)<jomiolto>would be an interesting challenge :)
(05:11:39)<joe6pack>i think there was 2k one made once
(05:11:52)<joe6pack>4k source or 4k binary? 
(05:11:53)<jomiolto>was that source or executable? because I'm talking about executable here
(05:11:59)<joe6pack>oh
(05:12:05)<joe6pack>it was javascript source 
(05:12:08)<jomiolto>ok
(05:12:41)<joe6pack>i think eve a hello world that uses ncurses is already more than 4k :p
(05:13:10)<Aerton>2k of obfuscated C code
(05:13:15)<jomiolto>http://www.hugi.scene.org/compo/ <- there are some really interesting stuff for asm oriented people :P
(05:14:11)<jomiolto>graphical tetris in 363 bytes? wow!
(05:14:41)<joe6pack>#include <curses.h>
(05:14:45)<joe6pack>main(){
(05:14:48)<joe6pack>}
(05:14:58)<joe6pack><-- 6.5kb bin size
(05:15:16)<jomiolto>yeah, but we used .com files in DOS for those :)
(05:15:28)<jomiolto>and assembler of course
(05:15:42)<joe6pack>oh, ok :)
(05:16:00)<joe6pack>if i compile with -Os and strip the bin it's 3.2kb
(05:16:24)<joe6pack>what did you use to display the graphics?
(05:16:29)<jomiolto>I think I could make a small roguelike in something like 4k with 16bit assembler, using the bios interruptions (so it would work in DOS or from a bootable floppy)
(05:16:36)<jomiolto>joe6pack: VGA mode 13H
(05:16:42)<jomiolto>:)
(05:16:53)<joe6pack>i don't even know how to access that from c
(05:17:07)<jomiolto>basically we just used bios to init a gfx mode and then output the graphics in a frame buffer
(05:17:25)<joe6pack>oh, so you can't run it under an OS?
(05:17:44)<Aerton>C is quite suitable for writing small programs as well, even if not as efficiently as asm
(05:17:49)<jomiolto>you can run it under DOS and windows, and even a DOS emulator, but nothing more sophisticated than tat
(05:18:14)<jomiolto>DOS .com files work surprisingly well in windows (even in XP)
(05:18:24)<joe6pack>by windows i assume you mean the dos emulator that is built into windows nt/2k/xp
(05:18:32)<jomiolto>yeah, basically
(05:19:09)<joe6pack>how would you do something like that under linux?
(05:19:30)<jomiolto>well, I must admit that I've never done any asm programming in linux :/
(05:19:53)<joe6pack>no, i mean accessing the frame buffer directly 
(05:20:13)<Aerton>check archives of linuxgazette.org - there was some tutorial about making ultra tiny binaries in asm
(05:20:23)<jomiolto>joe6pack: oh, I don't think that can be done easily without DosBox or some other emulator like that
(05:20:58)<Aerton>if you are running in kernel space, you can do that just as easily as in dos :)
(05:21:01)<jomiolto>hmm, except that there is the "console" framebuffer thing, but I've never programmed that
(05:21:02)<joe6pack>and is that because dos allowed you more direct access to the display that more modern OSs don't?
(05:21:25)<jomiolto>joe6pack: yeah, DOS allowed you to do just about anything, just as long as you didn't mess up the DOS memory structures
(05:21:40)<Aerton>VGAlib allowed direct access, but it's not supported anymore and doesn't work on modern videocards
(05:21:53)<jomiolto>you could call the BIOS VGA functions directly and just do your magic without having to worry about DOS interfeing with them
(05:22:00)<joe6pack>Aerton: so what is the lowest level you can get today? X11?
(05:22:42)<Aerton>if your driver support DGA, you can get direct access from x11
(05:22:59)<joe6pack>i really have no idea how to even begin doing something like that. i never even considered programming a pc not through some API provided by the os
(05:23:03)<jomiolto>sorry, but as interesting as this is, I have to go :)
(05:23:25)<jomiolto>(I'm giong to a b-day party of a friend)
(05:23:27)<jomiolto>bye
(05:23:30)<Aerton>just consider it to be hardware-provided API :)
(05:23:30)<joe6pack>bye
(05:23:38)<Aerton>see you
(05:25:38)<joe6pack>Aerton: what's the lowest level way of doing it in a platform independent way? and by "platform independent" i mean windows & x86-linux
(05:26:33)<Aerton>well, there aren't that much way to do it platform independent way to chose from
(05:27:00)<Aerton>the choice is limited to SDL and OpenGL
(05:27:14)<joe6pack>lets say os-independent. i don't mind if it only works on PCs
(05:27:47)<joe6pack>well then, that's even higher level than X
(05:28:02)<Aerton>anyway, you can't use directX/int 13h in linux, or SVGAlib/DGA/framebuffer in windows
(05:28:19)<joe6pack>ok
(05:30:18)<Aerton>actually, I don't miss these days that much: my some old programs tend to be tied to particular video or sound card series
(05:31:17)<joe6pack>but weren't there stuff like vesa 
(05:31:32)<joe6pack>that is compatible across video cards?
(05:31:50)<Aerton>it was a little bit late
(05:32:46)<joe6pack>or i think if you just used vga ans not svga that was also relatively device independent 
(05:32:47)<Aerton>vesa 2.0 was especially bad, many cards had the functionality, but before it came out
(05:32:58)<Aerton>vesa 3 was pretty much born-dead
(05:33:49)<Aerton>vga was pretty much consistent with a few minor quirks that were not clearly documented
(05:35:17)<joe6pack>so from what you are saying most dos programs were either vga or had code for a lot of various cards?
(05:36:11)<Aerton>yes
(05:36:16)<Aerton>vga or vesa 1.2
(05:37:22)<Aerton>and sound cards were much-much worse
(05:37:51)<joe6pack>i remember that you had to choose your card and provide irq etc..
(05:38:13)<joe6pack>but i don't remember a lot of games made you choose your graphic card
(05:38:30)<joe6pack>other than really old ones, like cga/ega/vga
(05:39:07)<Aerton>there were a few, mostly very early SVGA titles
(05:39:42)<Aerton>but computers of that day was too slow for non-static images in SVGA modes anyway, so games usually didn't use them
(05:39:44)<joe6pack>i guess vga was good enough for the hardware of the time anyway
(05:39:56)<joe6pack>yea
(05:40:31)<joe6pack>and by the time they were fast enough dos was already obsolete 
(05:40:56)<Aerton>IIRC, it took about 2 seconds just to draw screen once in 16-bit colour mode at the highest res on my ISA TVGA8900
(05:41:14)<joe6pack>and that was? 800x600?
(05:42:10)<Aerton>now, something wierd like 384x512
(05:42:18)<Aerton>it had to fit to 256kb
(05:42:27)<Aerton>now->no
(05:42:29)<joe6pack>heh
(05:42:53)<joe6pack>the 1st svga capable computer i had had a 1mb ciruss logic 
(05:43:11)<joe6pack>i think 800x600 was it's highest
(05:43:25)<Aerton>I remember, there was a manual with the card, listing all these modes and some instructions to set them
(05:44:07)<joe6pack>800x600x16 bit = 937.5 kb
(05:45:27)<joe6pack>i completely missed the early 90's in that regards 
(05:45:39)<Aerton>oh, there were dread interlaced modes
(05:45:58)<joe6pack>i had a pc xt from 86 or 87 and the next one was a pentium in late 95
(05:46:59)<joe6pack>so there is quite a "hole" in my experience with anything that came after 90-91 and before 95
(05:47:29)<joe6pack>since most of that didn't work on the pc xt
(05:47:53)<Aerton>that's quite a jump
(05:48:25)<joe6pack>yea my parents were going through some harsh times financially in the early 90's
(05:48:48)<Aerton>I've made a similar one, but smaller one 486->barton
(05:48:56)<joe6pack>barton?
(05:49:14)<joe6pack>is that some intel code name?
(05:49:51)<Aerton>amd, not intel, it's ~athlon 2500
(05:50:13)<joe6pack>ok
(05:50:22)<joe6pack>i now have an amd 3000
(05:50:38)<joe6pack>but i had an early pentium III before that 
(05:50:47)<joe6pack>so it wasn't that big of a jump
(05:51:33)<joe6pack>i would reckon that in terms of time your jump was just as big as mine
(05:51:39)<joe6pack>9-10 years?
(05:52:21)<Aerton>no
(05:52:27)<Aerton>I think ~5 years
(05:52:32)<joe6pack>can't be 
(05:52:41)<Aerton>the 486 was already obsolette by the time I've got it
(05:52:47)<joe6pack>ah ok
(05:55:11)<joe6pack>sounds like fun
(06:04:11)<Aerton>I think you can recapture some of the experience by writing for PSP, NDS or a similar handheld
(06:04:48)<joe6pack>i don't have the money to invest in anything but a pc 
(06:04:56)<joe6pack>and i replace those about once every 5 years
(06:05:09)<joe6pack>and i'd do that regardless of games
(06:07:41)<joe6pack>even on ebay nds cost ~90 euros
(06:08:37)<joe6pack>fuck these are expensive. even the games cost more than 15 euros a pop, used
(06:09:39)<joe6pack>maybe i'll search for a gba
(06:09:49)<joe6pack>those should be cheaper
(06:10:12)<Aerton>90E for a used one? Oo
(06:10:17)<joe6pack>was that obsoleted by the nds? 
(06:10:18)<Aerton>ridiculous
(06:10:22)<joe6pack>yea i know
(06:10:25)<joe6pack>austria....
(06:10:41)<Aerton>yes, GBA is much older
(06:10:41)<joe6pack>for some things there just isn't a very good used market here
(06:11:08)<joe6pack>but i remember something about the nds not being a replacment for the gba but a different platform?
(06:11:23)<Aerton>it can emulate gba
(06:11:24)<joe6pack>or was that just marketing bullshit
(06:13:15)<joe6pack>in the american ebay it costs less than that in usd...
(06:13:30)<joe6pack>there is one for $75
(06:13:44)<joe6pack>]although with almost $50 shipping in the us
(06:13:54)<Aerton>lol
(06:14:03)<joe6pack>i can't imagine why shipping such a small package inside the us would cost that much
(06:14:26)<Aerton>perhaps, express mail
(06:14:54)<joe6pack>perhaps trying to lure in people that didn't notice the shipping with the low price
(06:15:51)<joe6pack>http://cgi.ebay.com/Ninteno-DS-USED-with-Zoo-Keeper-No-Reserve_W0QQitemZ140216745851QQihZ004QQcategoryZ62054QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem
(06:15:56)<joe6pack>this one is good
(06:16:17)<joe6pack>i think that's less than half the price of what i've found in the austrian ebay
(06:16:42)<joe6pack>65 usd = 41 euro
(06:17:44)<Aerton>without a charger
(06:18:53)<joe6pack>oh
(06:19:21)<joe6pack>i remember you could use a standard transformer with the original gb
(06:19:28)<joe6pack>which was the only one i've had
(06:19:34)<joe6pack>the green screened one
(06:20:03)<Aerton>you can use any as long as parameters and pins match
(06:20:14)<joe6pack>than that's not a problem 
(06:20:34)<joe6pack>you just get a universal one for a couple of euros 
(06:26:15)<Aerton>I don't know if it can be charged through USB like PSP lite
(06:26:18)<joe6pack>i can't imagine why i'd want one, other than for programming it. if i want to play a game i'd rather use my pc
(06:26:18)<joe6pack>and i don't really feel the urge to play games on the road 
(06:26:20)<purestrain>yeah, take a good book instead of a nintendo ds :-)
(06:26:21)<Aerton>it can double as an somewhat overpriced video/mp3 player
(06:26:22)<joe6pack>i don't travel often enough for that to be an issue 
(06:26:51)<Aerton>although I agree, it's by no means an essential thing to posses
(06:27:03)<purestrain>buy yourself a gp2x
(06:27:04)<purestrain>:-)
(06:27:19)<Aerton>I think even in Europe you can get more than one good book for the price :)
(06:27:19)<joe6pack>and inside the city i normally don't spend more than 5 to 10 consecutive minutes in any given subway...
(06:28:26)<joe6pack>my commute is far too short and too chaotic to do anything but stand or sit
(06:28:52)<joe6pack>the only time i can think of that i'll use one is:
(06:28:58)<joe6pack>1. airplane 
(06:29:12)<joe6pack>2. long range train rides
(06:29:22)<joe6pack>and these come maybe once every few months 
(06:29:28)<Aerton>anyway, I was not going to try to convert anyone, just noted that programming experience is similar
(06:29:39)<joe6pack>ok :)
(06:29:58)<joe6pack>was just ranting on how i don't need one, wasn't directed specifically at you
(06:30:19)<Aerton>I like allegrex (psp) ams much more than x86 :)
(06:30:24)<joe6pack>i also have an mp3 player that i haven't used for at least a year for the same reason
(06:30:29)<Aerton>ams->asm
(06:31:20)<joe6pack>mips?
(06:31:38)<Aerton>yes, it's based on mips
(06:32:22)<Aerton>since I can't have an SGI workstation :)
(06:32:39)<joe6pack>heh
(06:32:52)<joe6pack>i used to use an irix box in my previous uni 
(06:32:59)<joe6pack>have never seen it, though 
(06:33:04)<joe6pack>only remotely 
(06:33:25)<joe6pack>same for solaris and digital unix 
(06:34:00)<joe6pack>although i think the sgi servers don't use mips?
(06:34:37)<Aerton>I don't know much about sgi
(06:34:51)<Aerton>R1600 - was it on server or workstations only?
(06:36:02)<joe6pack>no idea. i don't know much about them either, my experience ends with ssh-ing to some big invisible box that i know nothing about and as far as i'm concerned just acted like a generic unix system
(06:37:28)<joe6pack>they should make embedded systems more open, like PCs
(06:37:42)<joe6pack>i could have tried programming my nokia cell phone
(06:37:43)<Aerton>unfortunately, the fun hardware is way too expensive to justify spending on it :/
(06:38:01)<joe6pack>but i have no idea how to even get data on it
(06:38:52)<Aerton>by some wierd overpriced nokia-usb cable?
(06:39:06)<joe6pack>i don't know, i didn't find using big unices particularly fun. the user land on these beasts is far infirior to gnu
(06:39:25)<joe6pack>i think i looked it up once, it required something like that
(06:40:00)<joe6pack>or maybe even requireing me to set up a server and connect to it from my phone
(06:40:08)<joe6pack>via the internet i mean
(06:40:39)<joe6pack>which is probably prohibitively expensive when acessed through the cellular network
(06:41:04)<Aerton>and inconvenient
(06:41:13)<joe6pack>i did a bit of j2me, but only run it on an emulator
(06:41:23)<joe6pack>got payed 400 euros for it or so...
(06:41:28)<Aerton>starting browser, going to bookmark, exiting and running your program every time
(06:41:32)<joe6pack>only took a couple of hours :)
(06:41:51)<Aerton>nice
(06:42:20)<joe6pack>yea it was for some guy's master thesis i think.
(06:42:36)<joe6pack>was just some bouncing balls demo 
(06:42:47)<Aerton>I'd like to try to program a cellphone one day, but I don't know java, and I don't have a cell phone capable of running custom software :)
(06:43:03)<joe6pack>run it on an emulator like i did
(06:43:20)<joe6pack>nokia has free SDKs that bundle emulators for several phones
(06:43:39)<Aerton>well, it doesn't catch the magic feel of it
(06:43:40)<joe6pack>and java is easy to learn if you know c++ or c#
(06:44:44)<joe6pack>also, it's kind of frustrating. the crappy interface really excludes a lot of games that can actually run quite well on the hardware 
(06:45:05)<Aerton>I guess it's easy to start coding in it, but learning how to do thing the java-way rather than using c++ approach can take time
(06:45:25)<joe6pack>you don't need to worry about it at the begining though. 
(06:45:28)<Aerton>interface - API or cellphone inputs?
(06:45:42)<joe6pack>the cellphone keyboard
(06:47:16)<joe6pack>i once had to code c++ at a job, and i just started programming and kind of picked it up along the way. i'm sure my code wasn't particularly "beautiful" but it wasn't hard to get it to do what i wanted it to
(06:47:51)<joe6pack>was close enough to java (which i knew well) to make it fairly easy 
(06:48:56)<joe6pack>and at least from the input of the other guy working on it, it wasn't half as bad as the code he was used to getting from phillips... 
(06:50:24)<Aerton>speaking of languages, I've stumbled today across black perl - quite a shocking thing to see
(06:50:38)<joe6pack>black perl?
(06:50:49)<Aerton>it's an old thing, but not being a perl programmer I've never heard of it before
(06:51:06)<Aerton>http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=237465
(06:51:09)<joe6pack>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Perl
(06:51:10)<joe6pack>?
(06:51:27)<joe6pack>yea
(06:51:29)<joe6pack>same thing
(06:51:56)<Aerton>yeah, wiki links to this page
(06:53:14)<joe6pack>what does it do?
(06:53:48)<Aerton>I've actually run it, apparently it does nothing
(06:53:56)<joe6pack>:|
(06:54:08)<joe6pack>then what's the point...
(06:55:06)<Aerton>well, I didn't have spellbook or spiders
(06:56:09)<Aerton>probably, it terminates on exit at the first line
(06:56:21)<Aerton>but at least it compiles without a saying
(06:57:20)<joe6pack>boswars seems nicer than spring
(06:57:41)<joe6pack>but it too doesn't have much of a  single player campaign 
(06:58:06)<joe6pack>otherwise it would be close to being a decent open source rts
(06:58:18)<Aerton>spring - an open source total annihilation?
(06:58:22)<joe6pack>yes
(06:58:52)<joe6pack>how can i get into a game that has no single player campaign? especially one that is somewhat different like spring?
(06:59:03)<joe6pack>i can't just pop up on the public servers 
(06:59:15)<Aerton>never heard of boswars before...
(06:59:35)<joe6pack>i mean i agree that the multiplayer is the important part of the gane,
(06:59:36)<joe6pack>game
(06:59:39)<joe6pack>but still 
(07:00:10)<joe6pack>without a good single player campaign to act as a tutorial there isn't really an entry point to the game
(07:00:26)<Aerton>single player mode should be at least good enough to lure new players
(07:00:26)<joe6pack>you are just overwealmed by it, at least if you have never player TA
(07:00:32)<joe6pack>exactly
(07:00:45)<joe6pack>and keep you interested long enough to actually learn all the basics
(07:01:02)<joe6pack>so that you can then get you ass kicked in multiplayer :)
(07:01:05)<Aerton>all screenshots are 640x480
(07:01:10)<joe6pack>of boswars?
(07:01:13)<Aerton>yes
(07:01:23)<joe6pack>i played it at a higher resolution,
(07:01:26)<joe6pack>it is not restricted
(07:01:55)<joe6pack>inside the game there is a "graphics" button or something like that that lets you change the resolution 
(07:02:16)<joe6pack>it is quite obvious, i didn't need to read any documentation to find it
(07:02:24)<Aerton>I don't the fact LCD's only support one resolution well :/
(07:02:28)<joe6pack>and that's also true of the game itself
(07:02:55)<Aerton>I guess I should try this game then
(07:03:05)<Aerton>not at 3AM although
(07:03:11)<joe6pack>the problem is that the tutorial is too short though
(07:03:34)<joe6pack>same single player campaign issue 
(07:03:42)<joe6pack>but at least better than spring
(07:05:41)<Aerton>IIRC, there were a couple commercial RTS's released recently inclined for online with very limited single player modes
(07:05:50)<Aerton>so it probably just catches the trend
(07:06:07)<joe6pack>i'll bet it wasn't *that*  limited 
(07:06:36)<joe6pack>the problem is that it is made by programmers, and programmers don't like static content... they want to auto generate everything
(07:06:36)<Aerton>Oo
(07:06:47)<Aerton>does the single player worth playing at all then?
(07:06:54)<joe6pack>yes, it is just very short
(07:06:56)<Aerton>is
(07:07:41)<Aerton>well, desire to auto-generate everything should not be an alien for the RL crowd :)
(07:07:50)<joe6pack>maybe i'll try some random skirmish 
(07:07:54)<joe6pack>yea :)
(07:08:10)<joe6pack>but in rl's the autogenerated content is also single player 
(07:08:23)<Aerton>also?
(07:08:34)<Aerton>98% I guess
(07:08:36)<joe6pack>ok, *is*
(07:08:46)<joe6pack>100% as far as i have seen until now
(07:09:04)<Aerton>there are few attempts for online rls
(07:09:13)<joe6pack>yea, never tried them
(07:09:33)<joe6pack>other than the single player-on-public-server ones
(07:09:47)<Aerton>I've tried some, but multiplayer + turnbased just do not blend well
(07:10:02)<joe6pack>are you in australia? new zealand?
(07:10:05)<Aerton>no, I mean trully multiplayer, like crossfire or mangband
(07:10:15)<Aerton>korea
(07:10:19)<joe6pack>really?
(07:10:40)<Aerton>it's not that far away by time zone
(07:10:40)<joe6pack>are you an expat or a real korean?
(07:10:49)<Aerton>russian
(07:11:06)<Aerton>I just have a job here
(07:11:14)<joe6pack>i know, it's just that most koreans i've met barely speak english. so i was surprised 
(07:12:02)<Aerton>well, my engrish is not stellar either :)
(07:12:28)<Aerton>actually, few koreans speak very well, but not the general mass, even in IT
(07:12:44)<joe6pack>so is life like over there? are you in Seoul?
(07:13:03)<joe6pack>of the ones i met only 1 spoke english well 
(07:13:19)<Aerton>there is basically no snow here in the seoul :(
(07:13:40)<joe6pack>oh wow
(07:13:44)<joe6pack>10 million people
(07:13:50)<joe6pack>i had no idea it was that big
(07:14:01)<joe6pack>that's bigger than all of austria...
(07:14:19)<Aerton>I think it's more than that if you include the suburbs
(07:14:31)<joe6pack>10,356,000 (Metropolitan area 23 million) [1]
(07:15:05)<joe6pack>also insane population density 
(07:15:20)<Aerton>indeed
(07:15:45)<joe6pack>almost twice NYC's 
(07:16:08)<joe6pack>so do you like it? how long have you been there?
(07:16:51)<Aerton>it's a nice place to live for some time
(07:17:00)<Aerton>I'm here for a year
(07:17:33)<Aerton>the most impressive thing is cheap but ultra-fast internet
(07:17:41)<joe6pack>how are the salaries there?
(07:19:49)<Aerton>mm, it's hard to compare salaries... in absolute numbers I think ~2-2.5k$/month (after taxes and housing) is common for IT
(07:20:28)<joe6pack>so similar to europe 
(07:20:32)<joe6pack>maybe a bit less
(07:20:42)<joe6pack>how much is housing?
(07:21:32)<Aerton>~1$k for a good one room flat
(07:21:42)<joe6pack>so 3-3.k
(07:21:45)<joe6pack>3.5
(07:21:50)<Aerton>less, if you (or company) provides a considerable deposit
(07:22:35)<Aerton>how much does european housing cost?
(07:22:55)<joe6pack>$3500 ~= 2200. not bad, if it's after taxes. a bit less than here
(07:23:10)<Aerton>I want to life a couple of years in eu afterwards :)
(07:23:12)<joe6pack>my flat in vienna cost 400 euro for just the rent
(07:23:49)<joe6pack>but i am sure that everything else in seoul is much cheaper than in vienna
(07:23:49)<Aerton>well, the overall level is comparable
(07:24:22)<joe6pack>yes. same order of magnitude 
(07:24:24)<Aerton>IIRC, seoul is considered to be one of the most expensive cities in the world alongside London
(07:24:58)<joe6pack>i find these lists hard to believe
(07:25:34)<Aerton>indeed, I find it rather hard to make straight comparisons
(07:26:00)<joe6pack>i can imagine the rent being higher, because it is such a big city. but koreans are in general much poorer than austrians and therefor i expect most things to be cheaper
(07:26:30)<Aerton>when you compare, some things are ridiculously cheap, while others are insanely expensive, it's not just like everything is 30% cheaper or more expensive
(07:26:55)<joe6pack>yes i know, but that is everywhere. i can also say the same about vienna compared to tel aviv
(07:27:09)<joe6pack>i came here 3 years ago
(07:27:53)<Aerton>I think most koreans do provide greater deposites, reducing rent prices and poorer ones do not settle in the same area as our office
(07:28:23)<joe6pack>you probably also pay more than locals 
(07:28:33)<joe6pack>regardless of deposit 
(07:28:36)<Aerton>I think if you provide ~100k deposit, you don't have to pay rent at all
(07:28:47)<Aerton>that's also true
(07:29:43)<joe6pack>so would you recommend it?
(07:29:56)<Aerton>moving to korea?
(07:29:59)<joe6pack>yes
(07:30:17)<Aerton>it's well worth even just for a change
(07:31:15)<Aerton>I don't think living for 5-10 years would be that great, but a year or two it's fine
(07:31:31)<joe6pack>i can recommend vienna for even longer :)
(07:31:47)<joe6pack>although i think i will leave in another year or 2 
(07:32:03)<joe6pack>it's also quite easy to find a job as a programmer here
(07:32:09)<Aerton>I guess, it's culturally closer
(07:32:39)<Aerton>it's tiring to be an alien forever
(07:32:42)<joe6pack>yea i didn't experience that much of a culture shock 
(07:33:02)<joe6pack>some minor things are different but i feel at home here after 3 years
(07:33:17)<Aerton>no matter how long do you live, you just look like a foreign daemon to the people
(07:33:35)<joe6pack>it's probably the same for asians coming to europe 
(07:34:05)<Aerton>I think so
(07:36:03)<Aerton>at least, now I can eat food labeled as spicy :)
(07:36:58)<joe6pack>:)
(07:48:16)<deveaho>hey joe6pack...
(07:48:22)<deveaho>what's caverover?
(07:48:28)<deveaho>a pre-cryptrover?
(07:48:37)<joe6pack>an old half-finished game of mine 
(07:48:39)<joe6pack>yes
(07:48:49)<joe6pack>where did you find it?
(07:49:30)<deveaho>rogueforge.net
(07:49:35)<deveaho>how do you even move?!
(07:49:47)<deveaho>oh
(07:49:54)<joe6pack>arrow keys...
(07:50:18)<deveaho>it's complicated :p
(07:50:22)<joe6pack>why?
(07:50:27)<joe6pack>forward moves
(07:50:32)<joe6pack>all the rest change direction
(07:50:47)<joe6pack>think of it as a fps :p
(07:51:18)<joe6pack>i think you can even strafe with alt+direction
(07:51:29)<joe6pack>or ctrl
(07:51:32)<joe6pack>something like that
(07:51:41)<joe6pack>i haven't worked on that one in a very long while
(07:53:44)<deveaho>leave it
(07:54:01)<joe6pack>leave what?
(07:54:14)<joe6pack>i have abandoned it a very long time ago
(07:55:05)<deveaho>i meant abandon it
(07:55:20)<joe6pack>too late for that ;)
(07:55:27)<deveaho>yea
(07:55:45)<joe6pack>i think something could have come out of it, but at least i learned c from it
(07:55:47)<deveaho>i don't know - should i start a fullsized roguelike?
(07:55:59)<deveaho>i've been making concept sketches all week
(07:56:00)<joe6pack>sure why not
(07:56:03)<deveaho>"carbonmonoxide"
(07:56:15)<deveaho>i'll hire an asciiartist for the logo
(07:56:22)<deveaho>like ne7/napalm
(07:56:45)<deveaho>http://ne7.untergrund.net/asc/ne7-juic.txt
(07:58:13)<Aerton>I guess asciiartist is a rare vacancy ^^
(07:58:58)<deveaho>or i'm going to make myself some
(07:59:15)<joe6pack>colobo looks pretty: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ca/Colombo_-_Lake.jpg
(07:59:23)<joe6pack>"colombo"
(07:59:28)<deveaho>although i only make .nfos for demos

(11:02:13)<joe6pack>hi TMC 
(11:53:28)<TMC>as O was saying
(11:53:30)<TMC>*I
(11:53:44)<TMC>I'm have uncontrollable
(11:53:50)<TMC>hiccups
(11:53:58)<TMC>I just spat water on my keyboard
(11:54:08)<TMC>nothing helps :(
(12:02:43)<TMC>it's gone!
(12:03:02)<TMC>after only about 25 minutes and nearly throwing up
(12:23:59)<joe6pack>well that's good
(12:24:34)<joe6pack>i wonder why arthur c clarck moved to sri lanka
(01:04:14)<joe6pack>what's up RotateMe?
(01:04:22)<RotateMe>it's over :D
(01:04:27)<joe6pack>the exams?
(01:04:31)<RotateMe>yep
(01:04:34)<joe6pack>:)
(01:04:49)<RotateMe>which means i'm going to start my 7drl tomorrow i guess
(01:05:13)<RotateMe>today i'm not in the state to do something that needs my concentration
(01:05:50)<joe6pack>what's your idea?
(01:06:52)<RotateMe>RogueWars, a roguelike dota kind of game
(01:06:56)<RotateMe>really just kind of
(01:07:08)<RotateMe>not sure if there will be spawns on your side too
(01:07:25)<joe6pack>language?
(01:07:26)<RotateMe>realtime, using the doryen library
(01:07:30)<RotateMe>c++
(01:09:05)<joe6pack>i would recommend amore uniquely googleable name
(01:09:26)<joe6pack>a name that preferably would not give any answer other than yours
(01:09:56)<RotateMe>RogueWars will be in one word
(01:10:00)<RotateMe>or does this exist?
(01:10:04)<joe6pack>yes
(01:10:15)<RotateMe>oh i c
(01:10:22)<Aerton>if the keyboard is full of water, creating an unique name should not be hard :-P
(01:10:24)<RotateMe>okay well i'm going to think of somehting
(01:10:38)<RotateMe>thanks for the hint
(01:11:51)<joe6pack>no prob. both "cryptrover" and "caverover" on google link either to only my games or 1st to my games
(01:13:39)<RotateMe>yeah... found out that dungeonhunter is used too
(01:13:43)<RotateMe>for a handful of games
(01:13:57)<joe6pack>yea these names are too normal :)
(01:14:11)<RotateMe>makes me wonder who else is so friggin brilliant to come up with such names ^^
(01:14:20)<joe6pack>you should try at least one non-common word 
(01:14:50)<TMC>your jsut about to start a 7drl?
(01:14:56)<TMC>*you're just
(01:14:58)<RotateMe>tomorrow i will
(01:16:32)<TMC>getting top of google for a query of a couple words isn't hard
(01:16:46)<joe6pack>even for 2 words it is
(01:16:51)<joe6pack>n't
(01:17:09)<joe6pack>especially if they form one new word
(01:18:01)<joe6pack>what's the story of the game?
(01:18:28)<RotateMe>some revolution where you can choose sides
(01:18:48)<RotateMe>i have some interisting themes in mind and a nice opening sequence
(01:18:55)<joe6pack>and do what
(01:19:02)<RotateMe>?
(01:19:10)<joe6pack>a revolution, and...
(01:19:37)<joe6pack>you storm the gamte s of the evil emperor's palace?
(01:19:46)<joe6pack>"gate's"
(01:19:50)<RotateMe>or vice versa
(01:20:02)<joe6pack>who is the villain? 
(01:20:04)<RotateMe>slay all those dirty revolutionists
(01:20:16)<RotateMe>that's the story bit i want to add
(01:20:36)<RotateMe>it seems the king is the villain if you play the revolutionists and again, vice versa :D
(01:20:51)<joe6pack>is it something like the star wars empire? the roman empire? 1984 police state?
(01:21:22)<RotateMe>fantasy theme, maybe a bit steampunkish
(01:22:37)<RotateMe>the revolutionists come from the woods and their units are mostly druids and animals
(01:22:42)<joe6pack>finalpalisade?
(01:23:03)<RotateMe>the king has made a pact with some strange dark forces who fight amongst his soldiers
(01:23:20)<RotateMe>what's this?
(01:23:44)<joe6pack>palisade is like a barrier 
(01:24:07)<joe6pack>"A fence of pales forming a defense barrier or fortification."
(01:24:29)<joe6pack>as in, the last point of defence before the fall of the kingdom
(01:25:37)<joe6pack>http://www.f1point4.com/f1point4/images/palisade_wall.jpg
(01:26:17)<joe6pack>what's the name of the rebel gruop?
(01:27:37)<joe6pack>you could use some sort of word play on "coup d'etat", since there aren't many english words spelled similarly to it 
(01:29:37)<RotateMe>oh it was a name suggestion :D
(01:29:49)<RotateMe>sounds nice
(01:30:12)<RotateMe>has no name as for now...
(01:30:21)<RotateMe>maybe the green hares?
(01:32:17)<joe6pack>i was asking because you can use the names of in game elements such as the rebel group or the king's name to create a unique name for the game
(01:33:00)<RotateMe>haven't thought that much of the content through i must confess
(01:33:06)<joe6pack>like "tarqanis' revenge" or something of that sort
(01:33:47)<joe6pack>http://www.google.com/search?q=tarqanis+revenge  <-- 0 results
(01:34:00)<RotateMe>"Defenders for the Lichking"
(01:34:12)<joe6pack>Lichking?
(01:34:15)<RotateMe>... was an actual name for a game i wanted to do
(01:34:19)<joe6pack>that was used in wc3
(01:34:22)<joe6pack>iirc
(01:34:33)<RotateMe>Lichking, yep
(01:35:03)<joe6pack>you might not get the 1st place in google with that name
(01:35:12)<joe6pack>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Defenders+for+the+Lichking
(01:35:35)<RotateMe>:(
(01:35:43)<RotateMe>liked it somehow
(01:35:56)<joe6pack>the idea is to use a name that was not used before, and therefor isn't known to google
(01:36:28)<joe6pack>just change lichking to something less common
(01:37:01)<joe6pack>like a made up name such as "tarqanis" or whatever.
(01:38:35)<joe6pack>you can find some random name generators online 
(01:38:47)<joe6pack>keep clicking until it generates something you like
(01:38:57)<RotateMe>written one myself once
(01:39:07)<joe6pack>use it then :)
(01:39:11)<RotateMe>for a friend who made an arena game called "percent warriors"
(01:39:26)<RotateMe>it's shit ^^
(01:39:41)<RotateMe>well it's fun
(01:40:13)<joe6pack>only john carmack can name his game something like "orcs & elves" and still get the number 1 position in google :p
(01:40:46)<joe6pack>http://www.google.com/search?q=orcs+%26+elves
(01:41:47)<RotateMe>"Hades Castor must die!" ^^
(01:42:04)<RotateMe>(greek myth name generator"
(01:42:31)<joe6pack>"KHades Qastor must die!" works better 
(01:42:53)<joe6pack>or even Kades
(01:43:04)<joe6pack>"Hades" is some greek god iirc
(01:43:25)<RotateMe>hades is the name of the underworld in roman mythology afaik
(01:43:39)<RotateMe>and castor is clear
(01:43:45)<RotateMe>it's a nice name though
(01:44:38)<joe6pack>http://www.google.com/search?q=Cades+Hastor+must+die <--2 results, http://www.google.com/search?q=Hades+Castor+must+die <-- 27,100 results
(01:45:13)<RotateMe>those bitches :D
(01:45:22)<RotateMe>stop using my names!
(01:46:01)<RotateMe>i get 250 results for the first, your google is cens0rt
(01:46:27)<joe6pack>what's your url?
(01:47:18)<Aerton>orcs
(01:47:20)<joe6pack>in google.de it gives many more results than in google.com
(01:47:30)<Aerton>& humans lead to the proper game as well
(01:47:40)<joe6pack>but the english one is the one that matters
(01:47:46)<joe6pack>yes i know
(01:47:50)<joe6pack>that was my point
(01:48:02)<joe6pack>when you are john carmack you get that luxury 
(01:48:35)<Aerton>I hate the misfeature of google trying to be smart and guess my language
(01:48:51)<joe6pack>yea i know what you mean
(01:49:13)<joe6pack>but you can tell it to direct you to the english google and it will generally remember that 
(01:49:16)<Aerton>especially when you are trying to figure how options->language->english look in hieroglyphs
(01:50:04)<RotateMe>:D
(01:50:22)<joe6pack>hieroglyphs? i didn't know you live in ancient egypt 
(01:51:12)<joe6pack>Hangul is actually not that difficult, consdering the resion 
(01:51:27)<joe6pack>"region"
(01:51:46)<Aerton>aren't chinese/japanese writing system called hieroglyphs in english?
(01:52:18)<Aerton>IIRC, ancient egyptian has a different name
(01:52:39)<joe6pack>"A hieroglyph (meaning: sacred carving) is a character of a logographic or partly logographic writing system. The term originally referred to the Egyptian hieroglyphs used by Ancient Egyptians, but is also applied to the ancient Cretan Luwian, Mayan and Mi'kmaq scripts, and occasionally also to Chinese characters."
(01:53:21)<RotateMe>"Aviel's stand"
(01:53:38)<RotateMe>without the " it returns some results but with them, none
(01:54:11)<joe6pack>so i guess your interpretation is correct as well. :) but i have never heard anyone refer to the chinese writing system as "hieroglyphs"
(01:54:19)<joe6pack>good
(01:54:57)<RotateMe>do you like the sound of it?
(01:55:19)<joe6pack>it's ok i think. as good as anything :)
(01:55:49)<joe6pack>i'd use it. i think the actual name is not that important, as long as it makes the game easy to find
(01:57:04)<RotateMe>we definetily need a rl random name generator for Joe6bot
(01:57:22)<joe6pack>feel free to write one ;)
(01:58:09)<Aerton>hm, english definition of hieroglyph is indeed different Oo
(02:00:08)<joe6pack>"hieroglyph" is in ancient greek

(04:34:44)<joe6pack>a new lotd, anyone?
(04:36:19)<joe6pack>it will have to do until one of you comes up with something better :p
(04:46:21)<Aerton>I can't belive there is no vt100 emulation library :(
(04:46:34)<Aerton>rxvt/screen/aterm use their own implementations
(04:48:44)<deveah>well isn't it great
(04:48:51)<deveah>boxedirc fullscreen-stuck!
(04:49:14)<joe6pack>alt+enter?
(04:53:17)<Aerton>ctrl-alt-f1
(04:54:44)<joe6pack>i don't think that works in windows 
(04:56:01)<Aerton>I forgot that it is not a linux channel :)
(04:57:06)<joe6pack>i think there are a fair number of linux users around here
(04:57:31)<deveah>fbOS - the FreeBasic OS!
(04:58:10)<deveah>an online roguelike would make WoW a piece of crap
(04:58:18)<deveah>in my opinion
(04:58:31)<Aerton>#angband idlers were helpful for my newbie linux questions eight years ago :)
(04:58:38)<joe6pack>isn't wow already more or less an online rl?
(04:58:53)<joe6pack>with pretty graphics?
(04:58:54)<Aerton>I've yet to see a good online rl
(04:59:00)<deveah>well..... the bad part of it it's that.... ehm....
(04:59:03)<deveah>it's 3d
(04:59:10)<Aerton>what common does wow have with RLs?
(04:59:23)<Aerton>aside from CRPG-like stats?
(05:00:04)<joe6pack>Aerton: if the people who d/l cryptrover are representative of the rgrd community as a whole, about 24% use linux
(05:00:49)<joe6pack>win: ~68%, linux: ~24%, mac: ~7%
(05:01:13)<joe6pack>i can count unique visitors ;) 
(05:01:35)<Aerton>do you linux binaries or just source code?
(05:01:35)<deveah>he can use proxies
(05:01:46)<joe6pack>just source
(05:02:34)<Aerton>then the number is somewhat inflated I guess, as even windows users might be interested in sources
(05:02:47)<joe6pack>that's not what i count
(05:03:11)<joe6pack>i use google analytics, which shows the os used to access the website
(05:03:24)<joe6pack>as well as browser, etc..
(05:03:44)<Aerton>ah, I see
(05:04:14)<joe6pack>the number of downloads doesn't say much anyway, because i reckon a lot of people get it from svn
(05:04:16)<Aerton>you've only announced it on rgrd?
(05:04:43)<joe6pack>also on rgra and rt, but it's basically the same communities 
(05:05:05)<joe6pack>+ a couple of friends and some people from kuro5hin
(05:05:13)<joe6pack>and people who got there via google
(05:05:31)<joe6pack>but i'm quite sure the rgrd/rt people are the vast majority 
(05:05:38)<Aerton>it seems more than rgrd
(05:05:59)<joe6pack>more rgrd than all the rest
(05:06:45)<joe6pack>the friends i talked to about it are maybe 4 or 5 people
(05:08:31)<joe6pack>the top referrals are: thelist.roguelikedevelopment, roguetemple, google, roguebasin, google groups 
(05:13:02)<Aerton>vim says to me - You escaped the dungeon.
(05:14:37)<joe6pack>that's ok, userland apps are supposed to communicate with you. you should start worrying when the kernel talks to you directly
(05:15:30)<Aerton>that would only take a single vmsplice
(05:26:37)<Glowie>Do you guys remember any simple single player puzzle games like Tetris or Bejeweled that you've liked?
(05:26:46)<joe6pack>break out 
(05:27:19)<joe6pack>that mines game from windows
(05:27:44)<Glowie>Breakout is a good one but doesn't fit my needs
(05:27:54)<joe6pack>what are your needs?
(05:28:45)<Glowie>I was considering another side project, a multiplayer 1vs1 puzzle game. You know, in multiplayer Tetris clearing a line adds it to the opponent :)
(05:28:59)<joe6pack>there is already such a tetris game
(05:29:09)<joe6pack>Snake
(05:29:10)<Glowie>I know
(05:29:13)<joe6pack>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_%28video_game%29
(05:29:29)<Glowie>That's why I'm looking for somethin different
(05:29:36)<Glowie>+g
(05:30:15)<Glowie>Hmm Snake might work but it's quite random.. Eating apples adds to your friend's snake?
(05:30:23)<joe6pack>you can make a multiplayer game which is some mix of breakout and pong 
(05:31:28)<Glowie>A block area separating two balls?
(05:32:19)<joe6pack>something like that
(05:32:26)<joe6pack>haven't thought about it yet,
(05:32:27)<Aerton>puzzle quest
(05:32:33)<joe6pack>but i think there is potential there 
(05:32:59)<joe6pack>you can also do a scorched earth clone 
(05:33:00)<Glowie>I've played PQ, but I want it to be fast and furious, real time
(05:33:21)<Aerton>zuma/luxor?
(05:33:31)<Aerton>frozen bubble
(05:33:39)<Aerton>motos/koules
(05:34:01)<Glowie>New names to me, gotta check those
(05:34:19)<joe6pack> frozen bubble is good
(05:34:49)<Glowie>Also it must not be random. The faster and smarter player must win most of the time :P
(05:35:09)<joe6pack>Archon
(05:35:42)<joe6pack>the action version of chess :)
(05:35:46)<Aerton>motos and koules are not random of all
(05:35:52)<Aerton>*at all
(05:36:00)<Glowie>I'll check those names
(05:36:38)<Glowie>Motos is a car game it seems
(05:36:39)<Aerton>first one is an old zx-spectrum game the second is a linux game, the main idea in both is similar
(05:36:46)<Aerton>no
(05:36:49)<Glowie>Oh
(05:36:55)<Glowie>Wikipedia fooled me
(05:37:26)<joe6pack>Glowie: just go through this list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apple_II_games
(05:37:40)<Glowie>x_x
(05:38:06)<joe6pack>a lot of the old games where somewhat abstract, because you couldn't really do that much with the hardware of the time
(05:39:00)<joe6pack>do an archon remake, it was a fun game
(05:39:15)<Glowie>They needed a good idea, not just graphics :P
(05:39:31)<Glowie>I'll read more about Archon
(05:39:32)<joe6pack>nah, most of that games of that time sucked
(05:39:43)<Glowie>Then the idea sucked :P
(05:39:46)<Aerton>motos http://youtube.com/watch?v=WJxa85-oH2I&feature=related
(05:40:05)<joe6pack>and they often just copied other games, but the thing is that the ones that are still remembered today are the best ones :)
(05:40:29)<Aerton>isn't there is an archon remake?
(05:40:38)<Aerton>xarchon or something like that
(05:40:43)<joe6pack>Aerton: there are several 
(05:40:51)<Aerton>there also was dark legions
(05:41:30)<joe6pack>i haven't played any of them in recent times though. i think the archon-likes isn't really a very popular genere these days
(05:41:32)<Aerton>I think archon is much more a fighting game than a puzzle
(05:41:40)<joe6pack>hrm
(05:41:45)<joe6pack>yea i guess that's true
(05:42:09)<joe6pack>but he said "fast and furious"
(05:42:16)<Glowie>So push the balls off the board
(05:42:17)<joe6pack>i think most of these are not puzzles
(05:42:28)<Glowie>1vs1 might need something to spice it up :P
(05:42:44)<Glowie>I'll try to be clearer
(05:42:54)<Aerton>koules is similar but somewhat more aggressive
(05:43:01)<joe6pack>and i figured by "puzzle" you actually meant "easy to implement" ;)
(05:44:07)<Glowie>Preferably fighting via a puzzle game that both players have a separate copy of, doing well in the puzzle makes the other guy's puzzle harder and it must be real time :P
(05:44:17)<Glowie>And again not too random
(05:44:33)<Glowie>Easy to implement is a plus ^
(05:45:31)<joe6pack>hrm. than i would say the pong/break out hibrid. every time one player removes a brick, something bad happens to the other player (maybe a brick is added?)
(05:46:02)<joe6pack>and i also don't remember any game like that from the past
(05:46:24)<joe6pack>so it will win a bit of an originality bonus ;)
(05:46:36)<Aerton>I think it should be space-confined game, if you do well, to take space from the opponent, making it harder for him
(05:46:48)<Glowie>Hmm.. It might be too similar every game without some spice
(05:47:04)<Glowie>Space taking is a good idea
(05:47:07)<joe6pack>Glowie: the special bricks can add spice
(05:47:34)<Glowie>Or perhaps shortening the paddle
(05:47:38)<Aerton>if you want spice, make a game themed on Dune books ^^
(05:47:46)<Glowie>Haha :P
(05:48:34)<joe6pack>yea, maybe instead of special bricks giving you bonuses, they give the opponent penalties 
(05:48:44)<joe6pack>like shorter paddle or faster ball
(05:49:34)<joe6pack>or take away his bonuses, like remove the floor or the gun if he has those 
(05:49:56)<Glowie>Making different bonuses is tedious ^
(05:50:05)<joe6pack>you don't need that many
(05:50:32)<joe6pack>and every one you make is automatically 2, since you can also have the penalty to the enemy version of the same bonus 
(05:51:31)<Aerton>you both control a gun, in the beginning of the game there is one <something> moving towards you and one towards opponent. if you shoot something, it will split in two and turn back to the opponent, if <something> collides with you, you lose a point/die
(05:51:41)<Glowie>That's a possibility but not exactly what I was thinking of. I'll need to plan some more :P
(05:52:25)<joe6pack>Aerton: ranged anti-pong?
(05:52:51)<Aerton>)
(05:54:39)<Aerton>hm, the progression rate would ensure quite a short game
(05:54:57)<Aerton>don't know if it fits "fast and furious"
(05:54:59)<joe6pack>yea, maybe instead of doubling you add 1
(05:55:57)<Glowie>The loss shouldn't be sudden.. More like balancing on the edge who has the advantage and then leaning towards another player (but with a possibility of a come back)
(05:56:43)<joe6pack>well you can have hitpoint that decrease each time the ball hits the paddle
(05:56:54)<Glowie>Ah I didn't notice Aerton's gun suggestion
(05:57:37)<Glowie>Do you know that alien-shooting-game-with-missiles-from-the-ground-while-protecting-houses?
(05:57:46)<joe6pack>yea
(05:57:53)<joe6pack>missle defense? 
(05:57:55)<joe6pack>or galaga?
(05:57:59)<Glowie>Ah that's the one
(05:58:01)<Aerton>paratrooper?
(05:58:06)<Glowie>Missile def
(05:58:30)<Glowie>Though Aerton's game would require a good ping :P
(05:59:00)<joe6pack>i've wasted my childhood playeing those games, i doubt there is a somewhat popular 80's game you can ask about that i haven't played at some point 
(05:59:02)<Aerton>any fast game would
(05:59:08)<Glowie>Haha
(05:59:48)<Glowie>Yeah, but in some games the small delay between the effect of your actions wouldn't matter as you're playing separate games
(06:00:06)<Aerton>true
(06:00:12)<joe6pack>i don't think it will be a problem with modern internet connections 
(06:00:27)<Glowie>With distance it always is :<
(06:00:37)<Glowie>~400 ms to Aerton
(06:00:52)<Aerton>well, I can download few mb per second, but my ping sucks
(06:01:28)<Glowie>We couldn't play Pew Pew together :P
(06:01:36)<Aerton>:-)
(06:01:44)<Glowie>(A crude cooperative game made by me)
(06:01:47)<joe6pack>Glowie: but with aretons game, you don't send the current position of the ball by net, just the actions like shooting. the position can be calculated by both computers
(06:02:14)<Glowie>Hmm
(06:02:15)<joe6pack>so i don't know if it would be that big of a deal
(06:02:26)<Glowie>But getting shoot orders still has a delay
(06:02:36)<Aerton>still, he will see my shooting only 200ms later and ball can move quite some distance by this time
(06:02:44)<Glowie>Exactly
(06:02:59)<joe6pack>but he doesn't control the ball at this point
(06:03:33)<joe6pack>if the bullet takes  half a second to traverse the screen to the other side it might work out, no?
(06:03:51)<joe6pack>i mean when the shooting isn't instantaneous 
(06:03:52)<Glowie>If I only send shoot orders the games will be different if the shot happens on my screen before it happens on Aerton's
(06:04:08)<joe6pack>hrm
(06:04:59)<Aerton>imagine I shoot the ball 100ms before it crashed to me: it will bounce off on my screen, but Glowie will see it hitting me because he will not get my shot in time and then, suddenly the ball will teleport halfway on the path to him
(06:05:08)<joe6pack>well i never really programmed a multiplayer game, but that sounds really  strange if that would be a problem. after all much heavier& faster games (like fps)  work fine over the network
(06:05:22)<Glowie>Aerton is a network guru ^
(06:05:34)<Aerton>fps cheat a lot in that regard ^^
(06:05:52)<Glowie>I had to rewrite the net code 3 times before Pew Pew worked properly
(06:05:54)<Aerton>in some cases they even rewind events back in time
(06:06:12)<joe6pack>then cheat as well ;)
(06:06:19)<Glowie>Smoke and mirrors..
(06:06:30)<Glowie>Harder to do with a fast arcade game :)
(06:06:57)<Glowie>FPS players complain about +100 ping already :<
(06:07:09)<joe6pack>urm... make it slower? again, you said you want a puzzle game. it sounds a lot more like an action game :)
(06:07:13)<Aerton>I think ~150
(06:07:35)<Glowie>This idea is a action game indeed, and puzzle was in my mind first
(06:07:42)<Glowie>an*
(06:08:26)<Glowie>But if an idea is cool it doesn't have to strictly be puzzle ^
(06:08:53)<joe6pack>you could also not care about people who are too far away from you.
(06:09:14)<Glowie>*Weep*
(06:09:45)<joe6pack>but i would go with a game that is a bit more puzzle-esque and therefor not as fast paced
(06:09:55)<Glowie>Some kind of a shooter would work if shooting spawns something on the other guy's screen
(06:10:28)<Aerton>in this case the player should affect each other in a less direct way, like proposed penalties in arkanoid would not be disastrous if applied with a delay
(06:11:01)<Aerton>I mean, delay would not be a disaster
(06:11:11)<Glowie>Yep indirect fighting was the original idea
(06:12:03)<Glowie>Aha!
(06:12:08)<Aerton>in mu proposal, turn back part can be replaced with a spawn
(06:12:11)<Glowie>Kirby's avalanche
(06:12:46)<joe6pack>i don't know this one
(06:12:55)<Glowie>Hmm it could but if the players shoot in the same screen the bullets can still hit on the other end
(06:13:02)<Glowie>A moment
(06:13:39)<Glowie>Does Puyo  Puyo ring a bell?
(06:13:57)<joe6pack>umm. is it the one with the 2 cannons? 
(06:14:03)<Aerton>if *everything* on the opponent part is delayed the same way and you don't interact with it, it should not pose a problem
(06:14:30)<joe6pack>oh i see 
(06:14:38)<joe6pack>yea i know this game
(06:14:39)<Glowie>Did that come fully
(06:14:59)<joe6pack>what did?
(06:14:59)<Aerton>this game? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDzNya5klcM
(06:15:08)<Glowie>That copy paste of mine
(06:15:14)<joe6pack>no
(06:15:25)<Glowie>Yes that one
(06:15:27)<joe6pack>but i see it now, i know this game
(06:15:32)<Glowie>Aerton's link
(06:15:32)<joe6pack>or at least this type
(06:15:44)<Glowie>God damn addicting, with a two player mode
(06:16:09)<joe6pack>i think it was a bit beyond my time, didn't really play it 
(06:16:25)<Glowie>It's not PC
(06:16:33)<Glowie>SNES
(06:16:39)<joe6pack>yea but i didn't have snese
(06:16:51)<Glowie>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%27s_Avalanche the gameplay section explains it
(06:16:53)<joe6pack>i know quite a few nes games, though
(06:17:02)<joe6pack>yea i konw it now,
(06:17:11)<joe6pack>because i have seen later games that have the same idea
(06:17:30)<Glowie>Though that would be a rip off :P
(06:18:04)<joe6pack>i was just saying i didn't play this game when it was new :) i.e. i don't know it from my childhood 
(06:18:41)<Glowie>:P
(06:21:44)<joe6pack>Glowie: find a new lotd please 
(06:22:03)<Glowie>I'm not good with those :<
(06:22:26)<joe6pack>it doesen't have to be perfect. just something you would like to share 
(06:22:45)<joe6pack>it doesn't require much to be better than the log of this conversation...
(06:22:54)<Aerton>does black perl fit? ^^
(06:23:18)<joe6pack>go for it
(06:23:40)<joe6pack>you can change the topic
(06:24:15)<joe6pack>\o/
(06:26:26)<joe6pack>and now gentlemen 
(06:26:32)<joe6pack>if you will excuse me 
(06:27:31)<Aerton>do you want to do it instead of pewpew?
(06:28:01)<Glowie>Pew Pew is pretty much finished for now :P
(06:28:27)<Aerton>ah
(06:28:31)<Glowie>It taught me the art of online programming
(06:28:44)<Glowie>Basics of it at least :P
(06:28:48)<Aerton>you've got a level up ^^
(06:29:37)<Glowie>So either it's gonna be an online Puyo Puyo or some shooter thing like you suggested
(06:29:54)<Glowie>I'll have to get 1.03 of FD out first in any case
(06:30:10)<Glowie>But I think an online PP would be fun
(06:30:43)<Aerton>puyo puyo == kirby avalanche?
(06:31:03)<Glowie>Yep it's the same core puzzle game
(06:31:43)<Aerton>it's better suited for online than my suggestion
(06:32:17)<Glowie>Perhaps.. But I think yours would be fun too, at least on the same computer :P
(06:32:36)<Aerton>speaking of FD, I'd like to request some features ^^
(06:33:07)<Glowie>Spawning stuff in a shooter for killing stuff has its problems.. The spawn rate of the neutrally spawned things decides the pace of the game
(06:33:12)<Glowie>Go ahead :P
(06:34:10)<Aerton>1) a command line option to force save-file name to use
(06:34:47)<Aerton>it should prevent user from choosing another save file name from withing the running game
(06:36:02)<Aerton>2) an option that makes the game print highscore list and exit immediately
(06:37:03)<Glowie>Will add those if the observing stops bugging :P
(06:37:11)<Aerton>3) to make possible to use some key sequence that can abort current action from any point of the game, save and then exit
(06:37:56)<Glowie>That might be harder
(06:38:19)<Glowie>Suggestions how to add that if not add a check in every single input loop?
(06:38:37)<Aerton>as an alternative to key sequence,  you can intercept SIGHUP
(06:38:43)<Aerton>I think it would be easier
(06:39:07)<Glowie>A neat hack would be to send all possible exit commands a few times and then save ^
(06:39:29)<Aerton>yeah, like ESC-ESC-ESC-G
(06:40:09)<Aerton>but will ESC work on say, level-up attribute raise screen?
(06:40:17)<Glowie>Yep. Though some rarer screens don't have ESC like level up
(06:40:22)<Glowie>Nope :<
(06:40:43)<Glowie>But I can't load from a level up screen either :P
(06:40:59)<Aerton>I think signal would be easier, as long as game state coherence is not broken
(06:41:24)<Glowie>There's a function for checking signals?
(06:41:58)<Aerton>you assign your function that will be called whenever signal is caught
(06:42:03)<Aerton>a callback
(06:42:12)<Glowie>Oo that's darn useful
(06:42:37)<Glowie>How exactly do I do that
(06:43:37)<Aerton>by sigaction()
(06:44:21)<Glowie>Yay
(06:44:50)<Glowie>Is it as clean as setting the callback to saveGame() at init?
(06:47:41)<Aerton>almost
(06:47:45)<Aerton>but with a caveeat
(06:48:09)<Aerton>it's called literally whenever signal is caught
(06:48:45)<Glowie>Can one create a new signal that only you can send
(06:48:46)<Aerton>even in the middle of your process_quaff_potion() or take_damage()
(06:48:53)<Glowie>Oh
(06:49:02)<Glowie>That can lead to crashing
(06:49:24)<Glowie>But better than nothing in 99% situations
(06:50:30)<Glowie>The game hangs idle for a while if the player has disconnet and at that time finishes last turn?
(06:53:12)<Aerton>I should think some more for a clean and easy solution
(06:53:21)<Aerton>I have to admit, I hadn't used signals that much
(06:54:43)<Glowie>Signals seem to be a whole new way to hack ^_^
(06:55:40)<Aerton>rather quite and old way ^^
(06:56:00)<Aerton>and->an
(06:56:16)<Glowie>A new for me :P
(06:56:45)<Glowie>Can I send a quit signal to Windows \o/
(06:58:28)<Aerton>:)
(06:59:00)<Aerton>I'm not sure if windows support signals without installing additional packages
(06:59:57)<Aerton>but with MS SFU you can use kill to close, say, acrobat reader
(06:59:58)<Glowie>At least I could disable that terminate console signal I think
(07:00:15)<Aerton>although, I've never tried to kill process 1 :)
(07:00:23)<Glowie>:P
(07:05:21)<Aerton>how does DGL handle this?
(07:05:38)<Aerton>or is it possible to use esc-esc-esc in nethack from any point?
(07:07:07)<Glowie>Don't know how DGL does it, Nethack might have a few such situations though can't remember any right now
(07:08:37)<Aerton>making and inscription?
(07:08:42)<Aerton>*an
(07:09:36)<Glowie>It might just waste the scroll, I'm not sure
(07:09:41)<Glowie>Same with wish
(07:10:25)<Aerton>oh, I just checked and my suspection that signal handler executes in parallel to the interrupted process confirmed
(07:11:31)<Glowie>But if it's a case of disconnect, doesn't the server process the last command first?
(07:12:53)<Aerton>it's not guaranteed that the processing would be finished
(07:14:15)<Glowie>Depends on when the signal is sent. If you send the signal you can have a delay, right?
(07:14:29)<Aerton>right
(07:15:50)<Glowie>If the delay is long, I'd say it's guaranteed
(07:17:14)<Aerton>the problematic case is the following: server gets a key press from player, feeds it to FD that is running in parallel, and then immediately discovers a disconnect, sending a signal to FD while it's still in the middle of quaff_potion()
(07:19:16)<Aerton>we can add sleep before sending a signal, it will help in some cases, but if the system is under load (think swapping) it still may run out before FD finishes quaff_potion()
(07:19:57)<Glowie>Does the sleep stop other games too?
(07:20:04)<Aerton>no
(07:20:13)<Aerton>they all run in parallel
(07:20:22)<Glowie>Then sleep for a minute, problem solved :P
(07:20:58)<Aerton>you will not be able to relogin for that minute
(07:22:45)<Glowie>Hmm
(07:23:07)<Aerton>are your inputs isolated in one module?
(07:23:23)<Glowie>Haha I wish they were.. FD was my first big project, remember?
(07:23:29)<Glowie>The input is scattered all across the board
(07:23:37)<Aerton>:/
(07:24:17)<Aerton>you managed to port it without too much trouble, so I think its design is not that bad
(07:24:47)<Glowie>Could be helluva lot better :P
(07:25:22)<Glowie>I still think a ~10 sec Sleep fixes it
(07:25:25)<Glowie>Or 20 sex
(07:25:26)<Glowie>c
(07:25:27)<Glowie>*
(07:25:58)<Aerton>not 100%
(07:27:28)<Glowie>Well if you can get a better idea :P
(07:28:03)<Glowie>But it's very problematic to check for the escape key in the middle of a getline for example
(07:28:23)<Aerton>I have two, but one of them would mean a more work for you if you inputs are really scattered
(07:28:48)<Aerton>another one is a lot of work for me (not sure quite if this one is even possible)
(07:29:26)<Glowie>Sure I could search all input places and copy paste a function call if you think it's the best way
(07:30:43)<Aerton>I want a generic solution that would not require changing code of every game
(07:31:44)<Glowie>That would be ideal, but not necessarily possible
(07:32:10)<Aerton>it should be possible
(07:32:19)<Aerton>the question is amount of work to do
(07:33:34)<Glowie>:)
(07:38:08)<Aerton>turns out doing things the proper way takes more than just running through telnet
(07:38:08)<Glowie>Did you try if observing really works yet?
(07:38:20)<Glowie>Oh
(07:38:28)<Aerton>I hadn't encountered that bug again
(07:38:40)<Glowie>Are you canging protocol?
(07:38:44)<Glowie>h+
(07:38:49)<Aerton>no
(07:39:46)<Aerton>now I think if it's possible that either you changed something when running first time in putty (some hotkey) or I've run server differently in some manner
(07:41:36)<Glowie>At least no options were changed in my end
(07:42:58)<Aerton>I don't recall changing anything either
(07:43:18)<Aerton>but there ought to be a logical explanation or at least some way to reproduce
(07:43:44)<Glowie>Yep

(11:44:54)<deveah>heh... max 9 fps on the simple console
(11:45:11)<deveah>and 450 with conLib, a friend got 720 fps!
(11:46:31)<deveah>hey Epyon|Hungover, how much fps do you get on doomrl?
(11:47:32)<joe6pack>Q? What happened to L?
(11:47:48)<deveah>hey joe6pack
(11:47:52)<deveah>it was replaced
(11:48:04)<deveah>yesterday, at 18:10 iirc
(11:48:18)<deveah>on #quakenet there was a discussion about Q and L
(11:49:17)<joe6pack>ok
(11:49:52)<deveah>how many fps' do you get on cryptrover?
(11:49:59)<joe6pack>i don't know
(11:50:02)<joe6pack>i never checked 
(11:50:20)<joe6pack>i also don't need more the 4 or 5...
(11:50:27)<joe6pack>s/the/than
(11:51:31)<deveah>oh, but even 9 fps looks shitty :/
(11:51:48)<deveah>you should try the taste of 430 fps!
(11:51:55)<joe6pack>but if i would ever need more than that i guess i would use sdl to make some sort of pseudo console
(11:52:19)<joe6pack>you have played it, did you ever notice the fps?
(11:52:28)<joe6pack>it was never a problem for me
(11:52:36)<deveah>no, you should add it a fpscount
(11:52:53)<joe6pack>that doesn't really make sense for a turn based game
(11:53:05)<joe6pack>it would be about 1 or 2 most of the time
(11:53:12)<joe6pack>since it will wait for player input
(11:53:54)<joe6pack>even if i play quickly i don't think i normally make more than 3 moves a second 
(11:54:27)<deveah>i'm thinking of making an ascii fast lib for textmode demos
(11:55:07)<joe6pack>to work on ansi consoles?
(11:55:15)<the_ru>aalib?
(11:55:20)<joe6pack>or some gui pseudoconsole?
(11:55:34)<Epyon|Hungover>Considering how unoptimized the speed system is, I guess the FPS would be pretty bad :D
(11:55:43)<deveah>well, the_ru, cacalib is now rocking the textmodescene
(11:56:04)<joe6pack>the_ru: i don't think aalib does what deveah is talking about
(11:56:16)<deveah>http://taat.fi/tmdc - they need loads of fps!
(11:56:31)<the_ru>I don'
(11:56:37)<the_ru>t really know what deveah is talking about
(11:56:41)<the_ru>so never mind
(11:56:56)<joe6pack>a common infliction ;)
(11:58:16)<deveah>now that i have this lib, i have to remake RoRLE
(11:58:27)<joe6pack>of course
(11:58:35)<joe6pack>it is the only logical conclusion 
(11:59:01)<joe6pack>:p
(11:59:29)<joe6pack>deveah: i couldn't really find a lot of info about cacalib
(11:59:35)<deveah>and 10kb of remaking
(11:59:47)<deveah>it's libCaCa, not cacalib sry
(12:02:18)<joe6pack>"libcaca can use almost any virtual terminal to work, thus it should work on all Unix systems (including Mac OS X) using either the S-Lang library or the ncurses library"
(12:02:36)<joe6pack>so it is a higher level library than ncurses
(12:02:45)<joe6pack>it's not a replacement for it
(12:03:08)<the_ru>huh
(12:03:08)<deveah>no, curses is like msdos - every windows is based on it
(12:03:21)<the_ru>pardon my ignorance, but why are you chasing FPS for text?
(12:03:36)<the_ru>it
(12:03:48)<joe6pack>deveah: no
(12:03:51)<the_ru>it's not like the terminal will get bored and leave unless you feed it often enough
(12:04:34)<joe6pack>the_ru: it is foolish to try to find reason in deveah's actions ;) 
(12:04:44)<joe6pack>just accept it and enjoy the ride 
(12:05:00)<deveah>it's fun to push your roguelikes to the maz
(12:05:03)<deveah>*max
(12:06:07)<the_ru>in other news, I believe I have finally fixed the bug that has been tormenting me for the past weeks
(12:06:08)<deveah>and i'm just starting a new rl
(12:06:22)<deveah>what rl are you devving the_ru?
(12:06:29)<joe6pack>what are you working on?
(12:07:04)<the_ru>the line-wrapping was doing very strange things... if a single word was to be displayed on a line, it skipped it completely
(12:07:11)<the_ru>so certain messages would just disappear
(12:07:32)<the_ru>I went through the missile code (since that's where I first noticed it), the player control code, the main game loop
(12:07:38)<the_ru>finally found it in the ui code
(12:07:44)<the_ru>now it seems stable though
(12:08:04)<deveah>what rl?
(12:08:07)<the_ru>TSL
(12:08:40)<deveah>oh
(12:09:11)<joe6pack>i should give libcaca a try
(12:09:13)<joe6pack>looks good
(12:09:42)<deveah>and loaded with effects too
(12:09:54)<joe6pack>link? tsl on google gives to many results
(12:10:09)<the_ru>try "the slimy lichmummy"
(12:10:13)<joe6pack>oh
(12:10:28)<the_ru>or http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/roguelike.php
(12:10:52)<joe6pack>yea i found it 
(12:11:23)<joe6pack>liked the line chars used for walls 
(12:11:51)<joe6pack>i was just being lazy and used '#'
(12:12:06)<joe6pack>so that i only need 1 type of char for a wall
(12:12:26)<joe6pack>and not to check if it is a corner and so on
(12:12:27)<the_ru>I used to have Nethack-style rooms
(12:12:36)<the_ru>boxes connected with #-corridors
(12:13:07)<joe6pack>oh you draw it using ncurses' box function?
(12:13:11)<the_ru>no
(12:13:42)<the_ru>just ACS_*
(12:13:49)<joe6pack>so you check yourself what kind of wall it is?
(12:14:04)<joe6pack>and draw the _ or | or whatever?
(12:14:24)<the_ru>well, I first build the map with generic "wall" and "floor" tiles
(12:14:35)<the_ru>then loop over the map, checking wall connectivity
(12:15:00)<the_ru>so there are like 15 wall types in total
(12:15:16)<joe6pack>sounds like a lot of work
(12:15:47)<TMC>hello, action packed chat room!
(12:16:03)<joe6pack>you should have something like websvn setup so that you have could given me a link to the code
(12:16:05)<the_ru>nah, ~150 lines of code
(12:16:10)<joe6pack>TMC: indeed!
(12:16:37)<joe6pack>ugg, the grammer in that sentence came out particularly obfuscated 
(12:16:58)<the_ru>and I have is_walkable()-type functions anyway, so the extra tile types don't really require much code
(12:17:18)<joe6pack>i call ~150 loc of c a lot :)
(12:17:39)<TMC>:o
(12:17:45)<joe6pack>that's almost half of the 7drl version of cryptrover ;)
(12:18:00)<TMC>chances are, since it's low level, that 150 loc doesn't do much 
(12:18:03)<joe6pack>more than half if i you don't count comments and empty lines
(12:18:08)<the_ru>well, it's 33k in total
(12:18:21)<the_ru>actually, it's exactly 33000 lines right now :-O
(12:18:29)<TMC>L:O
(12:18:31)<joe6pack>heh
(12:18:35)<the_ru>counting *.c and *.h
(12:18:41)<joe6pack>that could get hard to manage
(12:18:58)<the_ru>all code gets hard to manage :-O
(12:19:08)<joe6pack>not "all"...
(12:19:21)<the_ru>it's just "slightly inconvenient" now, not yet "unbearable"
(12:19:31)<joe6pack>you can keep it manageable but you have to work hard for it 
(12:19:42)<TMC>_all_
(12:19:43)<joe6pack>hi there glow
(12:19:46)<TMC>hi
(12:20:12)<joe6pack>TMC: sufficiently small code bases don't nesicerally have to get hard to manage 
(12:20:16)<Glowie>G'day guys
(12:20:25)<the_ru>well, it's a bit misleading
(12:20:35)<TMC>I meant that if you add enough code, it will get hard to manage
(12:20:39)<the_ru>for example, 3000 lines are just monster and item definitions
(12:20:41)<joe6pack>truw
(12:20:45)<TMC>more organised code goes further
(12:20:54)<joe6pack>that's why you should fight the urge to add a lot of code ;)
(12:21:17)<TMC>:/
(12:21:22)<the_ru>I also have verbose comments
(12:21:32)<the_ru>both the amount of text, and the way I write them
(12:21:35)<TMC>no, you should plan ahead and organise
(12:21:39)<TMC>hi
(12:21:42)<TMC>anyway
(12:21:45)<the_ru>usually /* \n text \n */
(12:21:48)<TMC>what are we talking about?
(12:21:58)<joe6pack>i find a lot of "organised code" is much bigger than it could have been if it was less "organised" 
(12:22:01)<TMC>mine informing me so that I can interject more efficiently?
(12:22:04)<TMC>*mind
(12:22:13)<joe6pack>the slimy lichmummy
(12:22:33)<TMC>ah
(12:22:35)<the_ru>it depends on how generic you make it
(12:22:43)<TMC>yes, it depends on the kind of organisation
(12:22:53)<the_ru>i.e. quick hack for special cases vs. complete framework that can handle anything
(12:22:58)<joe6pack>the_ru: yes. a lot of people seem to think generic == better. that is not always the case
(12:23:07)<TMC>by organisation I didn't mean piles of object orientated wrappers and the like
(12:23:17)<the_ru>I usually think "does it work? great!" :-]
(12:23:53)<joe6pack>TMC: even replacing 1 big function with 3 small ones isn't always a good thing
(12:24:04)<joe6pack>it depends on the situation
(12:24:33)<the_ru>I have 500-1000 line functions :-)
(12:24:49)<the_ru>or more (the item/monster definitions are just large switch()es)
(12:25:07)<TMC>yeah, reduces the ability to use goto :(
(12:25:30)<joe6pack>i sometimes try coding some things in 2 different ways, count the characters of each and use the one with fewer chars in it
(12:26:15)<the_ru>I pick the one that is easiest to read
(12:26:19)<joe6pack>but that is really only practical when i code for fun
(12:26:23)<the_ru>since I know, some day, I'll have to go back and change it
(12:27:19)<joe6pack>well yes, the point is that there is no fast and easy rule to what consists better code. you have to use your judgment every time
(12:28:14)<joe6pack>i have seen my share of OO happy programmers creating huge messes in their zeal to make everything a class or subclass 
(12:28:43)<joe6pack>or trying to make functions that are only used once or twice 100% generic 
(12:29:14)<TMC>I try to stop myself from coding things the shortest way I can
(12:29:25)<TMC>in code that will probably need maintaining anyway
(12:29:41)<joe6pack>whene it would have been much easier and faster (and smaller and more readable) to have 2 specific functions that share some superficial resemblance 
(12:30:51)<joe6pack>if i am coding for work i usually don't care as much about making it "beautiful". i try to get work done quickly, and maybe similar to the code that is already in the system. 
(12:31:44)<joe6pack>the_ru: which vcs are you using?
(12:36:19)<the_ru>vcs?
(12:37:11)<joe6pack>version control system
(12:37:17)<joe6pack>like svn or cvs
(12:37:19)<joe6pack>or git
(12:37:40)<the_ru>none, I guess?
(12:37:45)<joe6pack>:O
(12:38:02)<TMC>does anyone use git?
(12:38:24)<TMC>I'm not entirely happy with svn
(12:38:29)<joe6pack>i asked because i wanted to suggest installing something like viewvc or websvn, so that we can see the code we are talking about 
(12:38:35)<TMC>(wait, no, I'm not thinking of trying git!)
(12:38:42)<joe6pack>TMC: i never tried it 
(12:38:51)<joe6pack>i onlt used cvs and later svn 
(12:39:11)<joe6pack>svn is a bit problematic wrt the crappy merge, though 
(12:39:24)<TMC>I hear it sacrafices anything it can for efficiency
(12:39:27)<joe6pack>you basically have to do merges yourself 
(12:39:44)<the_ru>I don't really see the need, since I work alone
(12:39:44)<joe6pack>i've reaed only good things about it, but i have no idea really 
(12:40:03)<joe6pack>the_ru: you will once you get used to using one ;)
(12:40:06)<the_ru>if there is an overwhelming community effort to help me out, I might consider it :-)
(12:40:12)<TMC>cvs has better merging?
(12:40:16)<joe6pack>TMC: no
(12:40:25)<joe6pack>but git supposidly does
(12:40:39)<TMC>oh
(12:44:35)<the_ru>I barely know how to apply diffs
(12:45:35)<joe6pack>if you use a modern vcs you don't have to
(12:45:41)<joe6pack>it should do it for you
(12:46:28)<joe6pack>(svn does not always manges to do it for you because of the aforementioned crappy merge)
(12:46:29)<the_ru>I'm not even using a makefile :-O
(12:47:11)<joe6pack>coding like it 1979, baby!
(12:47:19)<joe6pack>s/it/it's
(12:47:37)<the_ru>well, it is a "retro" game :-)
(12:47:53)<the_ru>roguelikes - for those of us that can't draw!
(12:47:54)<joe6pack>well if your system works well for you
(12:48:06)<joe6pack>that is the onlt thing that matters
(12:48:16)<joe6pack>or can't be bothered to 
(12:48:26)<the_ru>I don't really see any need to make things more complicated
(12:49:16)<joe6pack>the point of these tools is to make things simpler 
(12:49:21)<the_ru>I'm pondering writing a script for checking compile dates though
(12:49:27)<joe6pack>but again, to each his own
(12:49:34)<the_ru>yeah, but I don't really trust tools :-/
(12:49:58)<joe6pack>do you trust your compiler?
(12:50:01)<TMC>programmer art is crappy afterall
(12:50:10)<TMC>the true appeal of ascii!
(12:50:20)<the_ru>I have to :-/
(12:50:27)<joe6pack>no you don't
(12:50:27)<the_ru>but it's probably full of bugs
(12:50:35)<the_ru>I just hope I won't run into them
(12:50:36)<joe6pack>you can write in assembly 
(12:50:58)<joe6pack>or you can write your own compiler
(12:51:29)<the_ru>I would, if I had eternal life :-)
(12:51:44)<the_ru>right now I just want to get a game finished though
(12:51:46)<joe6pack>my point was, you are dependent on something another person wrote wether you like it or not
(12:52:07)<the_ru>yes, of course
(12:52:21)<the_ru>but I can still try to keep those things to a minimum
(12:52:28)<TMC>a scritp to check compile dates?
(12:52:40)<the_ru>kind of like make does, just better
(12:52:46)<TMC>I don't know about that... libraries are time savers
(12:53:12)<TMC>unless they are buggy, don't provide what you want, are stupidly deisgned from your viewpoint, and eventually need replacing
(12:53:21)<the_ru>... until you try porting it to other platforms
(12:53:22)<TMC>then they are the biggest timewasters you'll ever have
(12:53:56)<TMC>yeah
(12:53:59)<the_ru>I just use ncurses and the standard library
(12:54:08)<TMC>I keep far away from any nonportable libraries
(12:56:56)<the_ru>just getting ncurses to compile nicely across different architectures and OSes can be cumbersome :-(
(12:57:43)<TMC>really? :(
(12:57:59)<the_ru>yÔøΩes
(12:58:24)<the_ru>there was some function that didn't exist on the Solaris box I tried on, for example
(12:58:51)<the_ru>also did a quick test with cygwin and it wouldn't link properly, even though the libraries were there
(12:59:22)<the_ru>I'm not ever considering trying a Windows-native compiler
(01:00:17)<TMC>...like gcc?
(01:00:25)<the_ru>?
(01:00:28)<TMC>*mingw
(01:00:34)<TMC>did you mean "windows native compile"
(01:00:45)<the_ru>such as MSVC++?
(01:00:52)<the_ru>or whatever it's called
(01:00:59)<TMC>I haven't tried it
(01:01:08)<TMC>only read it's C++ STL documentation!
(01:01:11)<joe6pack>the_ru: for me, if it appears here: http://www.unix.org/single_unix_specification/ i have no fear about using it
(01:02:06)<joe6pack>and that contains a metric shitload of libs and tools
(01:04:48)<joe6pack>although i think it only mentions SCCS wrt vcs
(01:04:54)<the_ru>I also have a hard time getting along with automatic package managers :-(
(01:05:06)<joe6pack>like apt?
(01:05:08)<the_ru>trying debian right now, and it installs way too much crap
(01:05:09)<the_ru>yes
(01:05:39)<joe6pack>i think on debian you can use dpkg to install packages without their dependencies 
(01:05:56)<the_ru>this is a workstation, but for some reason it thought it was a good idea to install exim and samba-server
(01:05:57)<joe6pack>so it will only install 1 package at a time
(01:06:18)<the_ru>but doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of automatic package management?
(01:06:22)<joe6pack>yes
(01:06:31)<TMC>slackware :
(01:06:33)<TMC>:)
(01:06:42)<joe6pack>i know what you mean, but i generally just let apt-get install whatever it wishs 
(01:07:03)<joe6pack>my laptop is fast enough to handle it ;)
(01:07:08)<the_ru>well, I have disk space... it's just annoying
(01:07:23)<joe6pack>yes i understand. i don't have a solution for you 
(01:07:26)<the_ru>TMC: used it for the last 5 years, but I didn't like the latest versions
(01:07:46)<the_ru>11-12 didn't work very well at all
(01:08:12)<the_ru>also used Crux for a couple of months, but I don't have the *time* to do *everything* manually
(01:08:43)<the_ru>Slackware used to be a good compromise
(01:10:33)<TMC>didn't?
(01:10:42)<TMC>any specific problems?
(01:10:56)<TMC>I burnt 12.0 to CD a couple months ago and still haven't installed
(01:11:05)<TMC>*general problems
(01:11:16)<the_ru>I don't really remember, but I didn't like it
(01:11:38)<the_ru>it might be related to the distribution increasing rapidly in size
(01:11:48)<TMC>yeah... 6 CDs now
(01:12:10)<the_ru>I installed just 1 CD back at 9... and it had everything I needed
(01:12:28)<TMC>well, 2 CDs has everything I need
(01:12:30)<joe6pack>well i see not many are jumping on the opportunity to continuously update the lotd
(01:13:33)<TMC>well +t is set
(01:13:46)<joe6pack>really? since when
(01:13:55)<TMC>well why was there no topic?
(01:14:07)<TMC>probably because quake is -
(01:14:46)<joe6pack>yea they seem to delete it every couple of weks
(01:14:48)<joe6pack>weeks
(01:15:55)<TMC>haaaaaaa
(01:16:33)<joe6pack>:(
(01:17:03)<joe6pack>there must be some way to config q not to do that, but i'm too lazy to find out
(01:17:11)<joe6pack>easier solution: 
(01:17:17)<the_ru>so, what do you think of Morrowind?
(01:17:50)<the_ru>I've been playing for two days - really TRYING to get into it - but I just can't see what the buzz was about
(01:17:56)<joe6pack>the_ru: you mean "walk-around-really-slowly-wind"?
(01:18:01)<the_ru>yeah
(01:18:17)<the_ru>who the hell designed that game anyway...
(01:18:31)<joe6pack>i uninstalled it very shortly after trying it for the 1st time
(01:19:05)<the_ru>I might end up doing the same
(01:19:41)<joe6pack>but part of the reason was also that the computer i had at the time was probably too old for it 
(01:20:26)<the_ru>500 MHz/256 MB is recommended
(01:20:34)<the_ru>I have twice of both, and it's still slow
(01:20:41)<joe6pack>huh. i had 666 Mhz/ 384mb
(01:20:41)<the_ru>twice/the double
(01:21:07)<joe6pack>so it wasn't my computer after all
(01:21:36)<the_ru>I don't get where it's supposed to lead
(01:21:40)<TMC>morrowind is a NWN expansion, isn't it?
(01:21:44)<the_ru>I'm just dropped off on an island
(01:21:45)<joe6pack>no
(01:21:58)<joe6pack>TMC: it is a very popular rpg
(01:22:04)<the_ru>of which 90% is an ash-covered wasteland
(01:22:16)<the_ru>with no real clue where to go or what to do
(01:22:49)<TMC>:(
(01:22:52)<joe6pack>maybe they were going for realism, with normal life being so boring 90% of the time
(01:22:54)<the_ru>everyone I meet is either a bandit (that I'm too weak to kill) or some over-friendly person with cheesy stock dialogue
(01:23:35)<the_ru>my dagger breaks, so I visit 3 or 4 towns, and am unable to find anyone that can sell me a new weapon
(01:23:53)<the_ru>so I have to rest between every battle to regain my Magicka, since magic is the only defense I have
(01:24:06)<the_ru>and it takes three fireballs to kill a rat
(01:24:48)<joe6pack>i don't know. maybe it attracts the same kind of people that like job-games like WoW
(01:25:03)<the_ru>well, I don't get it
(01:25:23)<the_ru>every game looks pale compared to Ultima 7, though
(01:25:29)<joe6pack>i don't get why someone pays to grind either, but some people do
(01:25:46)<the_ru>but Morrowind is outright bad and boring
(01:26:01)<joe6pack>maybe it's just not for us
(01:26:10)<the_ru>I guess not
(01:26:11)<TMC>I hate emacs default c++ indenting
(01:26:25)<TMC>mixing tabs and spaces insanely
(01:26:26)<the_ru>but I wonder - is Oblivion this bad too?
(01:26:32)<joe6pack>surely you can change it in your .emacsrc?
(01:26:41)<TMC>well of coruse you can
(01:26:57)<TMC>but why on earth mixed tabs and spaces?
(01:27:13)<TMC>I guess because gnu style is crazy, so they're used to the notion
(01:27:23)<the_ru>I use "stroustrup"
(01:27:24)<Glowie>You clearly aren't part of Elder Scrolls' target group, so I doubt you'd like Oblivion either
(01:27:26)<joe6pack>well if you want sane defaults rather that infinite configurability you should use vim ;)
(01:27:36)<the_ru>with a few exceptions
(01:28:17)<the_ru>Glowie: I played a bit of Daggerfall and it was way better than this
(01:28:19)<TMC>yeah... I've so far only found emacs nicer for doign complex editing
(01:28:22)<Glowie>Elder Scrolls fans tend to like Morrowind more. Also WoW and Morrowind do attract very different people as well
(01:29:05)<joe6pack>i guess they share the attribute of not being me :)
(01:29:30)<joe6pack>although i absolutely love all other warcraft games
(01:29:34)<Glowie>Maybe for the target group Morrowind is better and what makes it better for them makes it worse for you :P
(01:30:00)<Glowie>I liked WoW until I got to max level
(01:30:30)<the_ru>so what IS their target group? grandmas that don't want things to go too fast?
(01:30:41)<Glowie>In any case Morrowind is a great game in its genre
(01:30:44)<Glowie>Haha
(01:30:59)<Glowie>You can't describe a target group in a few simple words :P
(01:31:23)<TMC>" the target group Morrowind is better" ?
(01:31:26)<Glowie>Different people find different things fun in it. Exploration is probably one of them
(01:31:43)<the_ru>the problem with Morrowind is that there *is* no exploration
(01:31:47)<the_ru>everything just looks the same!
(01:31:54)<Glowie>FOR the target group TMC
(01:32:12)<Glowie>Don't skip words
(01:32:19)<TMC>oooh
(01:32:25)<Glowie>How far are you ru?
(01:32:44)<the_ru>Glowie: I dunno. Level 2, I've walked across the island twice
(01:32:53)<the_ru>I can't find anything interesting to do
(01:33:07)<Glowie>Haha, you've seen but a fraction of the world. It's huge
(01:33:12)<the_ru>If I encounter anything stronger than a Cliff Racer I get killed
(01:33:35)<Glowie>Perhaps it's not a game for impatient people
(01:34:08)<Glowie>Calling the game bad because you don't like it is wrong though
(01:34:22)<the_ru>well, it's an opinion
(01:34:25)<the_ru>I think it's bad
(01:34:48)<Glowie>As an opinion that's okay but don't state it as a fact :P
(01:35:08)<TMC>well
(01:35:25)<TMC>when someone says "This game is bad", it's obviously an opinion
(01:35:41)<Glowie>Not always in my eyes
(01:35:42)<the_ru>I was looking for an explanation of the games good points, since I fail to find any
(01:35:51)<the_ru>it's not entertaining, it's not rewarding
(01:35:54)<Glowie>Read a review :P
(01:36:05)<TMC>reviews are opinions :P
(01:36:27)<TMC>but, subjectivity of a statement is context sensitive
(01:36:29)<Glowie>They are but I never said anything about reviews and facts :)
(01:36:57)<Glowie>In a review you'll find what the reviewer found fun
(01:37:09)<the_ru>... or didn't? :-)
(01:37:24)<Glowie>Well that too ^
(01:37:43)<Glowie>But Morrowind's reviews are generally positive I think
(01:42:57)<the_ru>it seems so, yes
(01:43:09)<the_ru>the strongest point indeed seems to be the size
(01:43:24)<the_ru>but I still don't get it
(01:44:02)<the_ru>the first time I encountered an ash storm it was cool
(01:44:13)<the_ru>but then I realised it didn't really do anything except make it hard to see
(01:46:57)<the_ru>and the NPCs are really boring
(01:47:14)<the_ru>they don't have any *character*, they're just a lot of text that I don't have the patience to plow through
(01:47:54)<the_ru>like the first guy I'm supposed to find in Balmora
(01:48:09)<the_ru>"uh, well, I dunno what you should do really, just go out and level up a few times"
(01:49:12)<the_ru>that's truly an open-ended, epic story :-(
(01:58:08)<TMC>did they npc actually say go level up? :(
(01:59:11)<Glowie>[14:53] <the_ru> they don't have any *character*, they're just a lot of text that I don't have the patience to plow through              I find this contradictory. Text is one of the biggest ways to build the character
(01:59:27)<the_ru>he said something like "get a weapon, join some guild, bla bla"
(01:59:38)<the_ru>but I understood it as I needed more experience
(02:00:01)<the_ru>Glowie: yes, but there's too muchof it, it's too generic
(02:00:09)<joe6pack>other than fallout i almost never find "stroy-games" fun
(02:00:20)<the_ru>and the next person I meet says the same thing :-/
(02:00:36)<joe6pack>i like games that have clear goals, like tetris, warcraft, civilisation 
(02:00:52)<Glowie>In a huge world not all NPCs can be that unique :P
(02:01:11)<Glowie>Open ended games aren't for everyone
(02:01:16)<the_ru>Glowie: as I said, I'm comparing every game to Ultima 7 :-)
(02:01:32)<Glowie>Ah okay, missed that one I think :)
(02:01:39)<the_ru>and that had ~200 NPCs that were actually unique
(02:02:04)<the_ru>everyone even has a unique portrait
(02:02:07)<the_ru>and their own dialogue
(02:02:09)<the_ru>but it'
(02:02:19)<the_ru>s paced at three lines at a time, so it's possible to read it
(02:02:23)<Glowie>I've only played Ultima Online of Ultima series
(02:02:34)<joe6pack>it also depends on how submerged into the game world i can get. i think it is safe to say that fallout 2 was both big and open ended and i absolutely loved it
(02:02:40)<the_ru>well, it has very little to do with the "real" Ultima
(02:02:52)<Glowie>I know :P
(02:02:59)<joe6pack>because i could imagine it being me over there, scourging the wastelands :)
(02:03:30)<Glowie>Fallouts seemed to have that atmosphere
(02:03:37)<Glowie>I hope Fallout 3 has that too
(02:03:48)<joe6pack>yea, hopefully 
(02:04:02)<joe6pack>although i have higher hopes of starcraft II :)
(02:04:08)<Glowie>Me too
(02:04:23)<joe6pack>but i will need a new computer for that.
(02:04:25)<the_ru>Fallout had a sense of acheivement
(02:04:27)<Glowie>I wonder if Spore lives up to the hype
(02:04:34)<the_ru>when you accomplished stuff, it actually lead somewhere
(02:04:35)<joe6pack>that one looks cool as well
(02:05:19)<Glowie>Well you aren't that far in the game yet ru, maybe it just has a slow openinng :P
(02:05:55)<the_ru>I don't think I have the patience
(02:06:09)<joe6pack>was it junktown where you had that series of quests in which you could at every point decide to stab the sheriff/gangster in the back and work for the other guy? 
(02:06:09)<the_ru>I have BG2 and IWD2 that I still haven't finished :-)
(02:06:21)<the_ru>joe6pack: I think so
(02:06:38)<joe6pack>that was a good one
(02:06:39)<joe6pack>also,
(02:06:44)<joe6pack>reno in 2
(02:06:51)<joe6pack>huge and lots of stuff to do
(02:08:05)<the_ru>there is a reason most "infinite world" RLs fail, too :-)
(02:08:19)<the_ru>I know, I tried it once
(02:09:37)<the_ru>there's a subtle difference between "hand-made, non-linear" story and "generic autogenerated" content
(02:09:45)<joe6pack>yes
(02:10:05)<joe6pack>and if it is too big and you have too many choices it's also a disadvantage 
(02:10:18)<joe6pack>you lose yourself, you don't know what to do next
(02:12:55)<the_ru>I'm a bit worried about JADE
(02:13:01)<the_ru>if it'll ever be finished, that is
(02:13:22)<joe6pack>i don't because i never really got into adom that much
(02:13:47)<the_ru>me neither
(02:14:25)<joe6pack>i tried a couple of times but it didn't give me enough instant gratification at the early game to keep me going and further explor it 
(02:14:53)<the_ru>well, at first it appears quite generic
(02:15:12)<the_ru>but I think the more you play it, the more you realise how hand-crafted it really is
(02:16:25)<joe6pack>maybe the next rl i try to make, it will beging really simple and fast like cryptrover, but every level of the doungeon you get 1 new thing to do and the game gets more complex incrementally 
(02:18:57)<joe6pack>like maybe at some level you get magic ability, in another you some stealth ability etc.. could use standard roguelike abilities but don't introduce them at the beginning (like in the character creation process) but only one at a time as you advance in the game
(02:20:34)<the_ru>I think "hidden" skills are a good way to hide complexity
(02:20:42)<the_ru>you start with just the basic attributes or rolls
(02:20:57)<the_ru>then as you evolve, skills are added to a list
(02:21:15)<joe6pack>i mean to a certain point a lot of existing rl's already do that, because as you advance in levels you get new abilities but still you start with all the basic ones when you choose your class
(02:21:20)<the_ru>it should be very clear what effects they have
(02:21:23)<joe6pack>exactly
(02:21:42)<the_ru>but then, there could be lots of skills you don't have, and don't see
(02:21:51)<joe6pack>true
(02:22:00)<joe6pack>but that would make the game replayable 
(02:22:20)<joe6pack>because if you play the game again in a different way you will get the other abilities 
(02:22:53)<joe6pack>but that's true to classic rl's as well
(02:23:13)<the_ru>skills could be branching
(02:23:19)<joe6pack>you don't get to see all the magic abilities in crawl if you start as a rogue
(02:23:22)<the_ru>i.e. you need basic magic skills before you can specialize
(02:24:34)<joe6pack>Glowie: that conversation sounds familiar. wasn't there already one very similar to it some time ago?
(02:25:09)<the_ru>I'm pondering a system of "spirits"
(02:25:21)<the_ru>where you can gain spirits at certain places
(02:25:34)<the_ru>they are basically the stereotypical classes
(02:25:42)<joe6pack>ok
(02:26:05)<joe6pack>yea i think that's a good idea
(02:26:06)<Glowie>What conversation? :P
(02:26:10)<the_ru>e.g. if you bring an Ice Elementalist along, it will make your cold magic stronger, etc
(02:26:29)<Glowie>I went fullscreen and don't kow what you were talking about
(02:26:37)<Glowie>+n
(02:27:06)<joe6pack>Glowie: the one we are having now. startin at 14:23:08 CET
(02:27:30)<the_ru>I don't have character levels, nor fixed classes
(02:27:34)<joe6pack>http://yehieli.info/rgrd/log.txt
(02:27:35)<the_ru>no experience points
(02:27:52)<the_ru>I still want a way that characters can evolve though :-/
(02:28:08)<the_ru>there must be *some* way to specialise in different areas
(02:28:20)<Glowie>Something similar I think
(02:29:07)<joe6pack>the_ru: why no xp?
(02:29:12)<Glowie>Learn by doing?
(02:29:18)<joe6pack>you can have xp without classese
(02:29:26)<joe6pack>like fallout for example 
(02:29:27)<the_ru>joe6pack: I want it to be grind-less
(02:29:41)<the_ru>and it's hard to balance other skills, like stealth, against pure melee
(02:29:48)<Glowie>Don't allow the player to camp and there is no grind :P
(02:30:01)<the_ru>basically, I want plain melee to be the least gainful thing to do
(02:30:07)<joe6pack>but you could have xp and still make it a continual improvment instead of a decreet one like with levels
(02:30:16)<joe6pack>"discreet"
(02:30:24)<Glowie>Agree with ido
(02:31:14)<the_ru>yes
(02:31:23)<the_ru>but then, I don't have food
(02:31:37)<joe6pack>than add food ;)
(02:31:50)<the_ru>I don't think "avoid starvation" is an interesting challenge, since all other RLs already have it
(02:32:07)<joe6pack>just don't respawn monsters 
(02:32:20)<joe6pack>no player will stay in the lower levels if there is nothing to do there
(02:32:22)<the_ru>the problem with experience is that it requires a timer to keep pushing the player
(02:32:34)<joe6pack>no it doesn't
(02:32:46)<joe6pack>that's what we are trying to tell you
(02:33:19)<joe6pack>if you prevent the player from staying in 1 place too long that might as well be enough
(02:33:27)<the_ru>but
(02:33:35)<the_ru>how do I award XP for stealth?
(02:33:48)<joe6pack>by using your stealth ability 
(02:33:50)<the_ru>in fact, for *anything* besides just killing everything
(02:34:09)<the_ru>it's "always on"
(02:34:15)<the_ru>some enemies notice you, some don't
(02:34:24)<joe6pack>in crawl you train it by wearing light armor 
(02:34:30)<the_ru>the longer you stick around and the more noise you make, the more likely you are discovered
(02:34:45)<the_ru>(at least that's how it's intended to work)
(02:35:22)<joe6pack>if you wear light/no armor -> you are more stealthy -> your stealth ability is trained 
(02:36:07)<the_ru>so what prevents me from just walking around level 1 with light armor until I'm basically invisible?
(02:36:14)<the_ru>an XP curve?
(02:36:45)<joe6pack>maybe if there are no monsters to not notice you, your stealth ability is not trained
(02:36:57)<the_ru>I think it should be more about accomplishment than patience
(02:37:23)<joe6pack>on the other hand, you can assume your players are not monkeys and will not do boring things :p
(02:38:13)<joe6pack>if someone is really hard bent on grinding, let him do as he wish. but make the game fun and rewarding without requring it.
(02:38:20)<the_ru>well, there are Morrowind and WoW players... :-O
(02:38:57)<joe6pack>but your goal is not to prevent grinders from doing what they want, it is to let the others have fun while not grinding 
(02:40:31)<the_ru>the idea with the spirits is that they would be able to improve
(02:40:49)<the_ru>i.e. the ice elementalist would get stronger by casting cold magic
(02:40:50)<joe6pack>to me it sounds like xp with another name
(02:41:00)<the_ru>and if you cast fire magic, it will leave
(02:41:31)<the_ru>actually, it's more like dieties with another name
(02:41:39)<the_ru>you'd have to do certain things to please them
(02:42:06)<joe6pack>well, i would say implement this idea and if it comes out unbalanced or unfun we will think of a way to tweak it
(02:42:35)<joe6pack>but don't worry to much about these things at the beginning 
(02:42:50)<the_ru>heh
(02:42:56)<the_ru>well, I'm not exactly at the beginning
(02:43:13)<the_ru>I'm at the point I can't go on without deciding what I want my game to be like
(02:43:24)<joe6pack>try it then
(02:43:29)<the_ru>the "engine" is mostly done, now it's just a matter of what will set it apart from other games
(02:43:54)<joe6pack>you don't need to be original at any cost. the point of the game is to be fun 
(02:44:24)<joe6pack>all other requirements crumble in front of making the game more fun
(02:44:42)<the_ru>it's just that I don't find it very fun just leveling
(02:44:53)<the_ru>as I said, I want other challenges
(02:45:07)<joe6pack>than remove levels, as we said. that doesn't imply removing xp
(02:45:27)<the_ru>right now, I have my statues
(02:45:36)<the_ru>that give you abilities when you "talk" to them
(02:45:46)<the_ru>so you can just sneak up to them, or kill everything or the way there
(02:46:01)<joe6pack>ok
(02:46:23)<the_ru>at least they should give you a choice, I think
(02:46:55)<the_ru>like, "Hi, I'm the statue of the Thief - would you like me to improve your stealth or lockpicking?"
(02:47:15)<joe6pack>or give you the abilites according to what you have done until now
(02:47:39)<the_ru>yes, but then we're back at the problem how to track certain things
(02:47:40)<joe6pack>if you killed all the monsters on your way there, they might give you some fighter skill
(02:47:59)<joe6pack>if you sneaked up to them, a rogue skill
(02:48:49)<joe6pack>counters for every monster you kill? every spell you cast?
(02:49:09)<the_ru>yeah, but what if I don't do any of those?
(02:49:11)<the_ru>e.g. sneak
(02:49:25)<joe6pack>then the skill they give you is something like:
(02:49:42)<the_ru>and how would they work; is there any difference if I kill 20 or 200 monsters?
(02:49:53)<joe6pack>if (killed_monsters>m) //fighter skill
(02:50:09)<joe6pack> if (casted_spells) //magic skill
(02:50:16)<joe6pack>else //stealth skill
(02:50:27)<joe6pack>(casted_spells>m)
(02:50:34)<joe6pack>or (casted_spells>c)...
(02:51:03)<the_ru>couldn't I then just keep casting spells until my counter is full?
(02:51:11)<joe6pack>maybe a difference in tha ratio of monsters you have walked by to monsters killed
(02:51:54)<joe6pack>yes, but that was the point of letting grinders grind if they *really* want to. just don't make it necessary 
(02:52:13)<joe6pack>you can't tell people how to play the game
(02:52:37)<joe6pack>just make it a fun game for yourself. if someone is also having fun playing it in another way view it as a bonus 
(02:53:05)<the_ru>I think I'll go with multiple choices for now
(02:53:10)<joe6pack>ok
(02:53:44)<the_ru>I was considering another system as well
(02:53:48)<the_ru>for monster kills
(02:54:05)<the_ru>for each kind of monster, you get a point
(02:54:21)<the_ru>after a certain number of points, you improve the skill
(02:54:33)<joe6pack>try the one you said before, if it turns out in the future it doesn't work so well remove it and implement the other one
(02:54:34)<the_ru>so if you kill 10 different monsters with a sword, you sword skill improves
(02:55:06)<the_ru>killing a thousand monsters with the same weapon won't do any good, only the first one counts
(02:55:38)<the_ru>or if you kill them with magic, your magic skills improve
(02:55:47)<the_ru>the pacifists are still a problem though :-)
(02:56:03)<joe6pack>they will improve stealth and running speed 
(02:56:16)<the_ru>yeah, but when?
(02:56:34)<joe6pack>whenever they walk by a monster and don't kill it
(02:57:12)<the_ru>I think it would be hard to balance :-/
(02:57:21)<joe6pack>give it a tay
(02:57:22)<joe6pack>try
(02:57:30)<joe6pack>don't worry about balance 
(02:57:36)<the_ru>if you're on different sides of some water and the monster can't swim, you can just keep walking around
(02:57:42)<joe6pack>that's a problem for another day
(02:58:03)<joe6pack>than that kind of situation will not improve you skill
(02:58:30)<joe6pack>it will just make the condition a bit more complicated, but it is not a structural flaw
(02:58:31)<the_ru>I'm just thinking; what if *I* was in that dungeon?
(02:58:45)<the_ru>even if I was a trained fighter, I'd try hard to avoid combat
(02:59:56)<the_ru>I'd just grab the treasure and get out...
(03:00:19)<joe6pack>and improve you stealth and running skills while you're at it ;)
(03:00:39)<joe6pack>i know a lot of people who do not play like that
(03:00:47)<joe6pack>they will look for monsters to slay 
(03:01:02)<the_ru>then the monsters are too easy
(03:01:04)<joe6pack>and will therefor imporve differently than your character
(03:01:44)<joe6pack>ok. i think everything i had to say about the subject was already said  
(03:02:09)<the_ru>yeah
(03:02:16)<the_ru>well, it's great to just brainstorm
(03:02:22)<joe6pack>sure
(03:02:28)<joe6pack>that's why we're here
(03:02:38)<the_ru>but I guess you have a point, I should worry less about preventing bad playing and more about rewarding good playing
(03:02:39)<joe6pack>it's even on tpoic for the channel ;)
(03:02:52)<the_ru>the problem is just how to do that in a balanced way :-)
(03:03:43)<the_ru>I want my combat to be futile :-)
(03:04:00)<the_ru>I should make my ghouls rise again after a while
(03:04:03)<joe6pack>you don't. you release a horribly unbalanced game and get a flood of comments about how thinves are too powerfull nad mages too weak. at that point you make thives weaker and mages stronger
(03:05:08)<the_ru>well, it's just that the flood of comments is more like a trickle
(03:05:17)<joe6pack>heh: "After a while, you begin to notice that all the essays are an elaborate set of mirrors set up to reflect different facets of the author, in a big distributed act of participatory narcissism."
(03:05:22)<joe6pack>too true
(03:05:22)<joe6pack>http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001080.html
(03:05:57)<joe6pack>don't worry. even a few comments will be enough to tell you if something is broken 
(03:07:16)<joe6pack>oh wait, actually it is from http://www.idlewords.com/2005/04/dabblers_and_blowhards.htm
(03:07:23)<joe6pack>he was just quoting him
(03:08:23)<the_ru>going to my parents for dinner now
(03:08:32)<joe6pack>have fun
(03:08:34)<joe6pack>bye
(03:08:34)<the_ru>I wonder what they think of roguelike development, hm...
(03:08:40)<joe6pack>:D
(03:08:48)<joe6pack>they can be your beta testers

(02:12:57)<joe6pack>i wonder if they sell those outside of NA
(02:13:16)<joe6pack>hah
(02:13:23)<joe6pack>uk & ireland as well
(02:14:12)<joe6pack>no prices are listed but they are probably at least double the american price
(02:14:46)<joe6pack>anything priced in euros/pounds is expensive these days  :(
(02:14:50)<joe6pack>even more than normally 
(02:15:36)<joe6pack>these kinds of things used to be only 50% more expensive that in the US :p
(02:16:07)<joe6pack>ever noticed how people always bitch about their currency? regardless if it's value is rising or falling?
(02:17:05)<TMC>well... not really
(02:17:11)<TMC>but I complain about my own
(02:17:13)<joe6pack>they do over here
(02:17:39)<joe6pack>how is the nzd doing these days anyway?
(02:18:21)<joe6pack>the euro & ils seem to reach all times highs every couple of weeks
(02:20:07)<TMC>it's at about 82 US cents
(02:20:16)<joe6pack>nzd seems to be down relative to the euro
(02:20:18)<TMC>which is more than double what it was about 4 years ago
(02:20:32)<joe6pack>well everything is high relative to the usd
(02:21:15)<TMC>yeah, but it's high relative to everything recently because NZ has the highest or 2nd highest official interest rate in the developed world
(02:21:20)<TMC>for no good reason
(02:21:32)<TMC>except to try and bankrupt home owners :(
(02:21:34)<joe6pack>they will probably lower it soon then
(02:21:38)<TMC>no
(02:21:50)<TMC>not within the next 18 months, was the last official world
(02:21:52)<TMC>*word
(02:21:56)<joe6pack>really? don't they get shiot about it from the exporters?
(02:22:05)<joe6pack>*shit
(02:22:07)<TMC>oh sure
(02:22:15)<TMC>exporters are going broke
(02:22:39)<joe6pack>the israel central back is slashing interest like no tomorrow because the ils is too strong
(02:22:55)<joe6pack>but it is still not as fast as the fed res
(02:23:03)<TMC>the problem is that the reserve bank is required to consider nothing but the inflation rate when setting interest
(02:23:05)<joe6pack>so it doesn't really help
(02:23:18)<Aerton>hi there
(02:23:21)<TMC>hi
(02:23:25)<joe6pack>how much inflation was there in nz in 2007?
(02:23:27)<joe6pack>hi Aerton 
(02:23:34)<TMC>I think around 3.2% ?
(02:23:39)<joe6pack>high
(02:23:56)<joe6pack>same as israel (i think it was 3.1%)
(02:24:19)<joe6pack>which was above the inflation target of 1-3%
(02:24:37)<TMC>same target here
(02:24:47)<joe6pack>but growth was at ~5%/year in the past 4 years so it's not that terrible 
(02:25:02)<TMC>I think that the housing market is largely to blame for the mess in NZ
(02:25:29)<joe6pack>and inflation was formerly something like ~1% a year. it was the 1st time in recent years that they didn't meet the target
(02:25:44)<joe6pack>that's also the same thing all over the world 
(02:26:25)<joe6pack>but housing prices seem to have started stagnating in q1 2008, and lower prices are predicted by 2009
(02:27:37)<TMC>prices are dropping slightly here
(02:27:44)<joe6pack>i hope it's true, so that by the time i go back i can afford to live in tel aviv and don't have to move to the 'burbs like my parents and siblings 
(02:27:51)<TMC>after massive increases recently
(02:28:37)<TMC>I think the average rent of an average house in auckland is now more than 100% of the average yearly income
(02:29:02)<joe6pack>my brother and his wife left the city after they couldn't find an affordable bigger apartment and couldn't stay at their old one with the baby
(02:29:14)<TMC>(due to 10% mortage rates)

(11:53:57)<Roor>Hi all.
(11:55:36)<Glowie>Hello
(11:56:47)<Glowie>>_<
(12:20:44)<Roor>Hello again
(12:59:53)<DarkGod>plop
(01:00:27)<DarkGod>Check out my latest project (not RL-relaetd though ;> ) all in Lua! http://mailcatch.com/en/
(01:02:19)<Glowie>Interesting :P
(01:02:29)<Glowie>Are you working on it alone?
(01:06:54)<DarkGod>yes
(01:07:01)<DarkGod>I even made the smtp server ni lua :)
(01:07:16)<DarkGod>http://lua.net-core.org/sputnik.lua?p=Tethys:About
(01:08:01)<Glowie>You Lua freak :P
(01:08:18)<DarkGod>Lua rocks so much it even makes writting smtp servers fun ! :)
(01:09:20)<Glowie>Haha
(01:10:52)<Glowie>What makes Lua so special? I modified the UI Lua files in one game and it didn't seem so strange :)
(01:12:31)<DarkGod>It's simple yet very powerful
(01:16:24)<Glowie>Is Lua always an interpreted language?
(01:25:05)<DarkGod>usualy
(01:25:15)<DarkGod>but it's onle of the fastest available
(01:25:41)<Glowie>Can it be compiled into an executable ?
(01:26:31)<Roor>LUA comes with a command line compiler... it's named LUAC.
(01:26:53)<DarkGod>well you can put the lua code inside an executable object but taqht kills portability, dunno why you'd do it
(01:27:15)<DarkGod>there is a JIT for improved performances if needed (I never needed it yet ;)
(01:28:44)<Glowie>Okie
(01:29:03)<DarkGod>http://luajit.org/
(01:40:08)<RotateMe>nice topic ;)
(01:49:58)<RotateMe>what's a good fps for a realtime rl?
(01:50:32)<Glowie>33?
(01:52:25)<RotateMe>decide 33,40
(01:52:25)<null> 33
(01:52:34)<RotateMe>ah that's right
(01:52:57)<RotateMe>i'll keep 40 though >P
(01:55:53)<Glowie>You shouldn't notice a difference if the objects don't move fast :P
(02:01:22)<RotateMe>you do...
(02:01:45)<Aerton>neither of the two numbers make any sense
(02:01:45)<RotateMe>you wouldn't if you'd move pixelwise, but since it's a rl, you feel the slightest fps difference
(02:02:05)<RotateMe>no, it's depending on how you calculate how often a unit may move per second
(02:02:20)<RotateMe>and without this info, only Joe6Bot can decide what's right
(02:02:30)<RotateMe>1d60
(02:02:38)<RotateMe>roll 1d60
(02:02:38)<null>36
(02:02:41)<Aerton>both will seem not smooth on common monitors
(02:02:48)<RotateMe>?
(02:02:52)<RotateMe>smooth?
(02:03:02)<RotateMe>it's tile based, it will NEVER feel smooth
(02:03:19)<Aerton>tile based and realtime? Oo
(02:03:47)<RotateMe>sure, doesn't feel as bad as i thought in the beginning
(02:03:52)<RotateMe>play TomeNet to get a feeling
(02:04:04)<RotateMe>or watch the "Chronicles of Doryen" preview videos
(02:04:31)<Aerton>I did not like mangband/tomenet realtime aspect at all
(02:04:58)<Glowie>What is smooth on normal monitors then?
(02:05:07)<RotateMe>yeah the problem with those two is that they have games at their base that weren't made for realtime
(02:05:15)<Glowie>I thought eyes work approximately at 33 FPS
(02:05:33)<Aerton>something that can be used to divide common vsync frequency
(02:05:41)<RotateMe>the only difference between realtime and non realtime in fact is that enemies do stuff even if you don't
(02:05:48)<Glowie>:<
(02:06:06)<Aerton>if you use 33 fps, most frames will have 2 updates, and a few will have only 1
(02:06:21)<Aerton>assuming the most common lcd having 60hz
(02:06:34)<Glowie>If the vsync is 60, is 30 the best FPS?
(02:06:46)<RotateMe>Glowie, this article sums it up pretty good: http://dewitters.koonsolo.com/gameloop.html
(02:06:50)<Aerton>the best is obviously 60
(02:06:56)<Aerton>30 is the second best
(02:07:06)<Glowie>Well yeah that's what I meant :P
(02:07:13)<RotateMe>42 is the 0th best
(02:07:27)<Glowie>I've read that article
(02:07:57)<RotateMe>it has a thinking error in it though, and it doesn't take every aspect of games in account
(02:08:21)<RotateMe>eg. in my case the most simple loop at the beginning is the best i think
(02:09:00)<Glowie>The deltaTime method works well enough
(02:09:52)<RotateMe>yep... i think the estimated postion thing doesn't look good in a lot of games
(02:10:08)<Glowie>I guess it can be done well
(02:10:53)<RotateMe>well if you can estimate the objects position so well, it's hard to believe that actually calculating it would be much slower
(02:11:07)<RotateMe>and correcting the float value errors isn't that much of a problem
(02:13:00)<Aerton>only if you have simple game physics
(02:19:10)<RotateMe>if not you can use very large numbers (100000 per degree eg)
(02:19:36)<RotateMe>this will not be precise enough for spaceship controls but it will be okay for most games i guess
(02:33:01)<Aerton>how large numbers will help you? precision remains the same
(02:33:37)<Aerton>not to mention that precision is not the only problem of variable delta time
(02:34:45)<Aerton>you simply can not use the same math as for fixed delta
(02:55:55)<deveah>hey
(03:43:16)<RotateMe>if i have my Being objects stored in a vector, how do i remove them from there without getting memory errors the next time i loop through the vector=
(03:43:47)<RotateMe>if i just call a delete this; within the object it crashes the next time i loop through the vector
(03:50:41)<Glowie>If you delete a being while looping, start the loop again now that the size has changed?
(03:51:28)<Glowie>Or perhaps you forgot to vector.erase the being's pointer?
(04:05:31)<RotateMe>the vector contains the objects now, not the pointers... it's strange, i think it's something else
(04:07:31)<Glowie>If it doesn't contain pointers why are you deleting them with delete this; ?
(04:09:04)<Glowie>Or is delete overloaded in vectors to erase stuff, maybe I just don't know
(04:13:53)<RotateMe>well problem is, Being has a killMe() member function which should delete it, but Being has no access to the vector
(04:14:44)<RotateMe>i thought if i'd delete the object via delete this; (in killMe()) it would be removed from the vector but that's not true it seems (of course, it's c++ in the end)
(04:15:12)<Glowie>C++ isn't that friendly :P
(04:15:35)<Glowie>So is the object that calls killMe a pointer or not
(04:15:54)<RotateMe>it's the object itself
(04:16:15)<RotateMe>hmm but checkDead() is called from outside
(04:16:21)<Glowie>A dynamic or normal object?
(04:16:30)<RotateMe>maybe i should check it's return and delete it from outside? i don't know
(04:16:32)<RotateMe>normal object
(04:16:47)<Glowie>Don't use the delete operator with normal objects :(
(04:17:19)<RotateMe>what else then?
(04:17:46)<Glowie>Automatic objects are killed when the program exits their scope
(04:18:10)<Glowie>If you want to delete a thing inside a vector, use vector.erase()
(04:18:21)<RotateMe>hm this means i just have to erase it from the vector
(04:18:22)<RotateMe>okay
(04:18:34)<RotateMe>thx this stuff confuses the hell outa me :D
(04:20:29)<Glowie>You'd need a book, you don't learn proper C++ with online tutorials and asking what's wrong when the program crashes in my opinion. Or at least it'd be a lot less painful way to learn :)
(04:22:20)<RotateMe>maybe but i think what i did in three days is pretty much okay
(04:22:36)<RotateMe>and a book is pretty painful too if i read most of the same shit in a java book
(04:24:05)<Glowie>Perhaps, but at least you wouldn't have to guess how something works :>
(04:27:57)<RotateMe>wouldn't be so bad if the debugger was better
(04:28:10)<RotateMe>(or probably i don't really know how to use it)+
(04:29:10)<Glowie>:P
(04:29:28)<RotateMe>fuck vector.erase(i) crashes on me too, i'm going to read a friggin book
(04:29:37)<RotateMe>OF TO THE LIBRARYYYYyyyy...
(04:31:43)<Glowie>Try vector.erase(vector.begin()+i);
(04:40:15)<RotateMe>worked... just killed a 400 rats
(04:40:39)<Glowie>And that's what I meant with guessing how things work ^_^
(04:40:55)<RotateMe>well but attacking one in a big pack made a random rat receiving the damage
(04:41:13)<Glowie>A problem elsewhere
(04:41:23)<RotateMe>yep
(04:41:51)<RotateMe>big problem, because it probably means that the array that stores Being*s is broken :(
(04:42:10)<Glowie>Lovely
(04:42:21)<RotateMe>aside from that, killing r's in realtime is more fun than you might think
(04:42:29)<Glowie>:)
(04:42:40)<RotateMe>i added a little blood and red flashing when attacking and it's hack'n'slay at it's best
(04:44:08)<RotateMe>might it be that a pointer gets invalid when i erase one of the objects inside the vector?
(04:45:32)<Glowie>After erasing something a pointer points at you must not use that pointer.. I'm not sure what you mean by invalid
(04:46:17)<Glowie>Usually people set pointers that don't point at useful data to NULL so that they don't cause crashing
(04:47:01)<RotateMe>yeah that's how i did it
(04:47:14)<RotateMe>just before killing the first rat, it always damages the right one
(04:47:19)<RotateMe>after that it goes crazy
(04:47:33)<Glowie>That's a start
(04:47:39)<RotateMe>that's why i thought that the objects might get rearranged in memory after erasing one from the vector
(04:47:52)<RotateMe>which makes the pointers point to wrong objects
(04:47:56)<Glowie>Hmm..
(04:48:00)<RotateMe>(wild theory which i hope is not true)
(04:48:46)<Glowie>I *think* the other pointers still point at right stuff, but you might want to debug it to be sure
(04:49:04)<Glowie>Your way of handling beings begs for bugs :P
(04:50:33)<RotateMe>well i asked some people here yesterday that's what they suggested
(04:50:57)<RotateMe>if i only have the vector holding the beings my access to check certain fields on the map for beings is too slow
(04:51:17)<Glowie>I'm not that experienced at programming, but I wouldn't do it that way :p
(04:51:17)<RotateMe>way too slow, there gonna be big fat armies ;)
(04:52:08)<Glowie>How fat? Modern cpus can do wonders
(04:53:33)<RotateMe>not that fat that there would be problems but they are fighting each other so that there might be up to about 100 attacks per second
(04:53:38)<RotateMe>now imagine 1000 beings
(04:53:56)<RotateMe>100*1000 in the worst case if you scan through the vector each time
(04:54:32)<RotateMe>on the contrary 100 accesses if you have an array holding data
(04:54:39)<Glowie>1000 beings on a single map?
(04:54:55)<RotateMe>maybe :D
(04:55:07)<RotateMe>doesn't look that much actually, just tried it
(04:55:40)<RotateMe>and the array isn't that bug-begging, just make sure that when they move or vanish the array gets updated aswell
(04:56:04)<Glowie>Sure you can do it your way but I believe modern computers could run it without that optimization :)
(04:58:27)<RotateMe>ah it's gotta work, i will find what happens
(04:58:51)<Glowie>Probably just a simple bug, good luck hunting it
(05:03:10)<RotateMe>thanks
(05:17:04)<RotateMe>some rats are coming: http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/Aviel/Aviel02.png
(05:17:10)<RotateMe>some more: http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/Aviel/Aviel03.png
(05:17:31)<Glowie>A rat swarm
(05:17:44)<RotateMe>damn i need to add some firespells quickly :D
(05:17:49)<Glowie>:P
(05:48:01)<RotateMe>are there any good new diablo like games on the market?
(05:48:10)<RotateMe>(preferably with 2d graphics)
(06:10:09)<deveah>DiabloRL
(06:18:02)<RotateMe>it's too short and i played it too long but it sure is one of the best
(06:18:22)<RotateMe>wonder why this one out of all of Slash's is discontinued :(
(06:26:56)<RotateMe>s/Slash's/Kornel's ;)
(07:06:29)<Kadwiell>RotateMe: if I understand your "wild theory" correctly, I think it's exactly correct.. you basically shouldn't use pointers to elements in vectors, or at least not expect them to be valid after the vector's changed
(07:07:07)<Kadwiell>this is why I tend to end up with vectors of pointers to objects, which isn't very elegant, but works
(07:17:13)<Glowie>Ah good to know Kadwiell, I didn't know how vectors handle the stuff inside of them
(07:24:13)<RotateMe>Kawdiell, thanks for your hints... funny thing is that i changed my vectors from pointers to object just before i started the death thingy :D
(07:24:52)<RotateMe>i think i'll just write a function that updates the pointers in the array after someone is killed
(07:33:11)<Glowie>Works, but might drop the usefulness of the optimization a tad
(07:34:15)<RotateMe>yeah and i just realized that in order to leave the pointers in the vector right i have to update them every tick
(07:34:23)<RotateMe>so the usefullness is probably zero
(07:34:36)<Glowie>Haha tough luck
(07:34:47)<RotateMe>which means i'm going to get back to vectors with pointers
(07:35:19)<RotateMe>(which basically means changing a lot of .s to ->s :))
(07:37:13)<Glowie>Do you get the same optimization that way?
(07:37:25)<Kadwiell>Also means having to worry about deleting things when you're done
(07:40:10)<RotateMe>:D exactly, everything worked, but the beings became statues after i killed them
(07:40:34)<RotateMe>Glowie, yes
(07:40:41)<Glowie>Alright
(07:43:06)<Kadwiell>Rebuilding the array of pointers every tick should just be O(n), so if you really need that array you could probably do it.. more an issue of whether that sort of complexity is needed than speed, I think
(07:43:51)<RotateMe>no, it was what i thought... my wild theory thing
(07:44:35)<RotateMe>the array updating is just when the units move now
(07:44:41)<RotateMe>and just for this unit
(07:45:41)<RotateMe>if i create the units with Being rat = new Being; i have to delete them, even if they are completely out of the scope, right?
(07:46:40)<Glowie>Yes
(07:49:43)<Kadwiell>Good news is you _can_ use "delete this" for that(because the objects are all dynamic)
(07:49:58)<Glowie>:>
(08:27:33)<RotateMe>there will be blood: http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/Aviel/Aviel04.png
(08:27:46)<RotateMe>(and thousands of confetti rat)
(08:28:33)<RotateMe>that's it for today i guess
(10:02:19)<the_ru>I hope there will be powerful area spells as well :-)
(10:04:21)<the_ru>Oh - Pocky & Rocky screenshot in the parent directory
(10:30:24)<the_ru>I'm mostly done with Morrowind now BTW
(10:30:33)<the_ru>"mostly" as in "as much as I'll bother to play"
(10:30:52)<the_ru>I got to Dagoth Ur, but didn't know how to get inside so I turned back
(10:35:47)<the_ru>And I'm pondering adding larger-than-screen and wrapping levels to my RL, but it frightens me :-/
(10:35:48)<jomiolto>heh, Morrowind... I really liked that game :)
(10:36:02)<the_ru>I think it would take too much effort away from other parts that need improvement right now
(10:36:03)<jomiolto>I think I finished it twice or thrice
(10:36:33)<the_ru>I have somewhat mixed feelings about it
(10:36:44)<the_ru>it's a good game, but it could have been much better IMO
(10:37:25)<jomiolto>yeah, I know. There are some things, like the alchemy system and the soul gem stuff, that could have been really great, but the implementation isn't very good
(10:37:46)<jomiolto>the alchemy system is very easy to abuse
(10:37:57)<the_ru>I haven't even looked at tho
(10:37:59)<the_ru>se
(10:38:00)<the_ru>maybe that
(10:38:12)<the_ru>'s the problem - too many things to do but none done really well
(10:38:21)<jomiolto>you haven't mixed your potions? that's loads of fun in the game :)
(10:38:40)<the_ru>I haven't even used potions
(10:38:41)<jomiolto>oh, and then there's also the book system -- learning skills from books
(10:38:56)<the_ru>yeah, seen that - it was a nice surprise
(10:39:03)<jomiolto>and of course the whole huge friggin' world
(10:39:15)<the_ru>yes, but it's mostly wasteland :-/
(10:39:21)<jomiolto>yeah...
(10:39:37)<jomiolto>and sometimes having to walk for a long time really sucks
(10:39:58)<the_ru>What brings the impression down the most is probably the very generic dialogue
(10:40:11)<jomiolto>yes, that's true
(10:40:12)<the_ru>Like, when asked about services, shopkeepers talk about themselves in 3rd person
(10:40:46)<jomiolto>I'd really like to try out Oblivion, but I don't have a fast enough computer for that :(
(10:40:52)<the_ru>me neither
(10:41:06)<the_ru>but we'll soon have JADE *cough*
(10:41:28)<jomiolto>"soon"? you surely have a lot of faith, don't you :)
(10:42:27)<the_ru>OTOH - Daggerfall had even more boring terrain, but since it had automatic travel...
(10:42:54)<jomiolto>never played that, but I've heard that it had even more bugs than Morrowind?
(10:43:08)<jomiolto>some making the game almost impossible to finish
(10:43:10)<the_ru>I bothers me that I can't always loot the dungeons completely without walking for miles to drop stuff off
(10:43:22)<the_ru>that is, if I can find a trader that is willing to buy and has enough gold
(10:43:43)<jomiolto>heh, so I'm not the only packrat then :)
(10:43:44)<the_ru>I didn't play very far into it, but I heard they were pretty severe
(10:44:17)<jomiolto>I have a tendency to collect almost everything I find in CRPGs and roguelikes :)
(10:45:00)<the_ru>well, I don't have the patience to read the generic dialogue, so I don't get to do many quests
(10:45:18)<the_ru>Heh, yes
(10:45:32)<the_ru>I sometimes ponder writing a game that's only about inventory management :-O
(10:45:47)<jomiolto>sounds boring :)
(10:46:02)<the_ru>well, it
(10:46:09)<the_ru>'d have to be about trading
(10:46:20)<the_ru>or about survival maybe
(10:46:28)<the_ru>resource management
(10:46:56)<jomiolto>it could work if there was a nice and interesting idea behind it
(10:47:34)<the_ru>you've crashed on a distant planet
(10:47:40)<jomiolto>btw, I'm supposed to do a text adventure as an assignment for a programming class :)
(10:47:48)<jomiolto>will be a nice change to all the roguelike development
(10:47:50)<the_ru>you have a team with different roles
(10:48:20)<the_ru>you don't control the characters directly, but instruct them in general what they should be doing (mining, repairing, farming) and you control the resources
(10:48:57)<jomiolto>doesn't sound very roguelikish, does it?
(10:49:15)<jomiolto>more like a strategy game?
(10:49:22)<the_ru>I never said it had to be
(10:49:27)<jomiolto>oh, ok then
(10:50:09)<the_ru>wasn't there something in the newsgroups earlier about a ShopRL?
(10:50:17)<the_ru>was it just an idea, or an actual attempt?
(10:50:26)<jomiolto>can't say I remember that one
(10:51:39)<jomiolto>hmm, although I do remember one about you being a dungeon keeper, or something like that, managing a dungeon where adventurers come to fight monsters
(10:51:43)<the_ru>Maybe I just dreamed up the post in my insane fantasies
(10:51:55)<the_ru>... Dungeon Keeper?
(10:52:15)<the_ru>... was the name of an actual game :-)
(10:52:16)<jomiolto>no, not the game, but just generally running a dungeon :)
(10:52:21)<the_ru>ah, ok
(10:52:30)<jomiolto>hmm, I don't know, but isn't there a commercial game called Dungeon Keeper?
(10:52:35)<the_ru>yes
(10:52:48)<the_ru>it's about just that
(10:52:52)<jomiolto>okay
(10:54:28)<the_ru>I'm not really comfortable with the skills in Morrowind :-/
(10:54:52)<the_ru>Using skills to improve them does make sense, but it feels like it's flawed somehow
(10:55:16)<the_ru>feels like the better I get, the easier I improve
(10:55:44)<the_ru>Level 1-3 took the most time, then leveling sped up considerably
(10:55:54)<jomiolto>yeah, that's because your skill rolls succeed more often at higher levels, and skills are only improved on succesfull skill checks
(10:56:10)<the_ru>shouldn't they improve on failures?
(10:56:21)<jomiolto>yeah, I've been thinking about that too
(10:56:31)<the_ru>easy to learn, hard to master, and so on
(10:57:44)<jomiolto>usually you want the skills to develop slower at higher levels and you could get that "free" if you had your skills improve on failures
(10:58:15)<the_ru>OTOH - why?
(10:58:21)<jomiolto>why what?
(10:58:24)<the_ru>I think the best would be a linear pace of advancement
(10:58:47)<the_ru>like, on average every real-life hour you spend playing, you'd level up
(10:59:07)<the_ru>(the actual rate depends on the size of the game, of course)
(10:59:20)<jomiolto>well, that could get a bit too powerful if you spent very much time on some skill, wouldn't it?
(10:59:36)<jomiolto>having the skills develop slower at high level stops you from becoming uber powerful
(11:00:03)<jomiolto>but that of course depends on other aspects of the game...
(11:01:08)<the_ru>well, if you spent time at only one skill others would suffer
(11:01:24)<the_ru>and if one skill is all you need, the game is unbalanced
(11:02:33)<jomiolto>yeah, but I don't think many roguelikes implement dropping skill rates, do they? (I could very well be mistaken since I haven't played that many roguelikes)
(11:02:50)<the_ru>dropping skill rates?
(11:03:15)<jomiolto>wasn't that what you meant? skill rates dropping if you don't use some skill for a long time?
(11:03:24)<the_ru>was it with you I had a long level/XP/skill discussion a few days ago?
(11:03:31)<the_ru>perhaps it was joe6pack or someone
(11:03:41)<the_ru>that
(11:03:44)<jomiolto>no, I don't think it was me. I've been most idle for a few days :)
(11:03:56)<the_ru>'s an option as well, but I was thinking of other skills not improving
(11:04:05)<jomiolto>oh, right
(11:05:15)<the_ru>I don't like when in most games I get to level 5-6 during the first few hours and then it takes forever to get anywhere past that
(11:05:21)<jomiolto>well, that wouldn't really be a problem if there were no time limits in the game, would it? you could just kill a million rats to increase your sword skill and then proceed to kill another million with fireballs to increase your magic...
(11:05:44)<the_ru>well, that's exactly what I'm struggling with myself
(11:05:53)<the_ru>... so I have no experience or levels at all
(11:05:53)<jomiolto>boring as heck, but I think a lot of people do that (I know I do it sometimes)
(11:06:00)<the_ru>but that brings other problems instead
(11:06:49)<the_ru>well, if the player wants to play the most boring way possible, isn't that their problem?
(11:07:49)<jomiolto>hmm
(11:08:39)<the_ru>I think slow progress at high levels brings focus to the leveling itself, instead of using it as a general gauge for your strength
(11:08:45)<jomiolto>I don't know. I know that I don't necessarily want to play that way, but sometimes I just can't help myself, because I know that it will most likely help me improve my character in the game
(11:09:19)<the_ru>then throw in a few instadeaths where stats won't help, only player skill :-)
(11:09:34)<jomiolto>well, there is that of course :)
(11:10:02)<jomiolto>but I can't make my games too difficult, because I've never been a too good roguelike player myself, and I woudln't feel very good if I couldn't beat my own game :)
(11:11:10)<the_ru>last weeks conversation made me realise - if the players want to grind, they will
(11:11:12)<the_ru>so let them
(11:11:29)<the_ru>I want to make an entertaining game for players that play properly
(11:12:14)<the_ru>and I never said leveling should be completely linear, just less steep
(11:12:34)<the_ru>i.e. if you keep killing the same monster over and over, they'll give less and less experience
(11:12:52)<the_ru>but at "normal pace", you'll advance at a steady rate
(11:13:35)<the_ru>that's the advantage of the Morrowind, etc, system - you don't often go out just to *level*, you go out to explore and in the meantime improve your skills
(11:13:40)<jomiolto>I've been thinking about a similar system, where you can only learn a limited amount of skills from repeating something -- so that after killing a dozen or so rats, you wouldn't get any skill marks from rats anymore
(11:13:51)<the_ru>aye
(11:14:08)<the_ru>I have plans for a simple system
(11:14:14)<the_ru>I have weapon skills
(11:14:27)<the_ru>the first time you kill a creature of each type, you get a point in that skill
(11:14:40)<the_ru>after enough points, the skill improves
(11:14:58)<the_ru>so you'd have to "dedicate" your kills to a weapon type
(11:15:27)<the_ru>it makes experience a finite resource, instead of making the XP table steeper
(11:16:06)<jomiolto>and that would also make it worthwile to stick to a weapon you're familiar with, even if you happen to find a better weapon of some other type that you're not so skilled with
(11:16:14)<the_ru>yes
(11:16:29)<the_ru>or you could work on several skills, of course
(11:16:32)<the_ru>to remain flexible
(11:17:00)<the_ru>I'm having problems with thief-like characters though
(11:17:03)<the_ru>(as always, I guess)
(11:17:14)<the_ru>there's no easy way to track stealth
(11:18:24)<jomiolto>and that's part of the reason why I won't have a thief class in my next roguelike project :)
(11:19:21)<the_ru>I could instead let the player allocate the XP from kills on what skill they prefer - but then I
(11:19:24)<the_ru>'
(11:19:38)<the_ru>m back at square one; thieves would have to kill to gain XP
(11:20:30)<the_ru>I currently have these statues that are scattered throughout the dungeon that improve skills
(11:20:30)<jomiolto>perhaps they could gain experience from stealing and sneaking around?
(11:21:10)<the_ru>I'm pondering making them offer the player a choice, like "would you like to improve your stealth or your magic skill?"
(11:21:25)<the_ru>yeah, but how do I track someone sneaking around?
(11:21:54)<the_ru>I *could* keep count of every successful stealth roll (player wasn't detected), but that'd be easy to abuse
(11:22:19)<jomiolto>hmm, that is indeed problematic
(11:22:59)<the_ru>right now I'm leaning towards giving the player choices
(11:23:22)<jomiolto>that is always a possibility
(11:23:48)<jomiolto>it's not realistic, but thankfully roguelikes aren't required to be :)
(11:24:05)<the_ru>in a way it is
(11:24:25)<the_ru>if you were in that dungeon for real, even if you were a trained fighter, you wouldn't just charge at anything that moves
(11:24:39)<the_ru>maybe not realistic, but more natural
(11:25:17)<jomiolto>no, I meant the fact that you could choose which skill to increase -- in real life you increase skills through use and training
(11:25:18)<the_ru>melee should be the least profitable path to take
(11:25:35)<the_ru>a-ha
(11:26:00)<jomiolto>but I guess you could say that choosing to improve skill x means that your character exercises the skill in some way while you're not looking :)
(11:26:21)<jomiolto>hmm, why is everyone against melee :(
(11:26:34)<the_ru>in this case it's ancient sprits bestowing their knowledge upon the character :-)
(11:26:41)<jomiolto>okay :)
(11:26:47)<the_ru>so not very realistic, I guess
(11:27:23)<the_ru>but I meant - if combat is hard and futile, it would be natural to improve other skills that help you avoid battle in the first place
(11:27:27)<jomiolto>I think melee really needs some fresh ideas to make it less "bash everything that moves with the biggest sword you find" and more about strategic cohices
(11:28:18)<the_ru>well, some try, but it mostly results in too much text that no one bothers to read anyway :-)
(11:28:29)<jomiolto>yeah, I guess
(11:29:18)<the_ru>I'm trying to keep the player on his toes by using very small numbers
(11:29:30)<the_ru>no HP reaching into the hundreds
(11:30:08)<the_ru>if you know that 3-4 blows can kill you, you're more likely to bring out the bow than just run straight at the enemy
(11:30:19)<jomiolto>ah, but a dragon doesn't feel like a dragon unless it knocks off a hundred hit points with a swish of its tail :)
(11:31:07)<the_ru>a real dragon wouldn't let you get that close :-)
(11:31:11)<jomiolto>but I think that is a good point
(11:31:40)<jomiolto>leveling shouldn't increase your hit points a hundred fold during the game
(11:32:12)<jomiolto>... unless your character really becomes something like a demi-god during the game
(11:32:15)<the_ru>hm
(11:32:28)<the_ru>well, there are often ways to improve it without leveling
(11:32:37)<the_ru>potions, farming certain enemies, etc
(11:32:50)<jomiolto>well, yeah that too
(11:32:56)<the_ru>I think the real problem is that some games require such a high HP to be beaten
(11:33:26)<jomiolto>yes, that's exactly the thing -- the more difficult monsters are more difficult because they simply deal more damage
(11:34:04)<jomiolto>and because of that you need to up the hp count, unless you want to have instakills lurking around every corner
(11:34:12)<the_ru>indeed
(11:34:30)<the_ru>I'm trying to make each monster type a unique challenge
(11:34:39)<the_ru>I'm not sure I'm very successful though :-)
(11:34:43)<jomiolto>heh :)
(11:35:12)<jomiolto>my next roguelike project is going to be quite small with a very limited number of monster types, so it shouldn't be too difficult to make each one of them different from the others
(11:35:25)<the_ru>OTOH, some things can really be annoying
(11:35:37)<the_ru>like enemies that are only vulnerable to magic, when you have no magic available
(11:36:49)<the_ru>anyway, I think the generic XP and level system is a dead end
(11:37:08)<the_ru>it's not a good solution at all, it's just a way to limit the disaster
(11:37:56)<jomiolto>perhaps, but it's what people are used to, and I don't think I've seen anything different in any of the major roguelikes. someone should really come up with a new and innovative system...
(11:38:01)<the_ru>and I think we've all been a bit tainted by AD&D and it
(11:38:07)<the_ru>it's strict classes
(11:38:27)<the_ru>its, not it's
(11:38:49)<jomiolto>well, I've never actually played D&D in any installment, so i've only been corrupted second hand through rogyelikes :)
(11:39:40)<the_ru>the strict class division has lived on in pretty much every CRPG since then
(11:40:11)<jomiolto>original rogue didn't have classes, did it?
(11:40:15)<the_ru>no
(11:41:19)<jomiolto>kind of interesting, since pretty much all the roguelikes after rogue have classes
(11:41:27)<jomiolto>or something similar
(11:41:52)<the_ru>most of the commercial games had them, I guess
(11:41:52)<jomiolto>but I guess that's simple way of bringing variety to the game...
(11:42:50)<the_ru>but does it?
(11:43:02)<the_ru>it's more about restrictions than variety
(11:43:03)<jomiolto>depends on the game, I guess
(11:43:10)<the_ru>like mages not being allowed to use armor
(11:43:35)<the_ru>they've brainwashed us all into believing mages can never use armor, for some reason!
(11:44:08)<jomiolto>ADOM is the game I'm most familiar with, and at least in it the classes/races have a big impact on the earlier game, although not nearly as much on the later game
(11:45:08)<the_ru>but isn't ADOM skill-based?
(11:45:15)<jomiolto>yes
(11:45:21)<the_ru>like Crawl
(11:46:00)<the_ru>what I'm talking about are the limitations, like "you can't do that because you're a fighter"
(11:46:21)<the_ru>fighters can't use magic, mages can't use armor, barbarians can't use clothes, etc
(11:47:12)<the_ru>"to successfully play a mage, you have to be brooding and mysterious!"
(11:47:36)<jomiolto>well, that's roleplaying, you know ;)
(11:48:00)<jomiolto>(or the exact opposite of it, depending on how you view it)
(11:48:53)<jomiolto>wait, I know exactly what roguelikes need: ninjas with magic!
(11:51:12)<the_ru>I know what I need
(11:51:14)<the_ru>sleep!
(11:51:18)<the_ru>l8r
(11:51:23)<jomiolto>okay
(11:51:24)<jomiolto>see you
(11:54:14)<cakeboy>ninjas having magic kind of makes sense at least
(11:54:26)<cakeboy>at least vials of potion that make smoke and shit like that
(11:57:10)<jomiolto>no, I was thinking more like a ninja coming at you like a whirlwind with swords in both hands, and then suddenly starting to shoot balls of magic too... now that would be cool :)
+++ The date has changed: 2008/03/29 +++
(12:01:07)<jomiolto>but I guess it is sleepy time for me too
(08:35:47)<the_ru>aren't ninjas supposed to have guitars?
(11:03:09)<TMC>yes
(03:15:08)<the_ru>Bah
(03:15:15)<the_ru>I can't come up with a good way to divide my weapon skills
(03:16:17)<the_ru>For example, staves
(03:16:33)<the_ru>They're two-handed, do blunt damage and are poles
(03:17:09)<the_ru>Due to their length, they should benefit from the same skill as longsword
(03:17:22)<the_ru>but since they don't cut but crush, they're also a lot like maces
(03:18:09)<the_ru>Flails are mainly blunt but IMO should also benefit from being skilled with whips
(03:19:15)<the_ru>Maybe each weapon type should have two skills
(03:19:25)<the_ru>Longswords would be blades + two-handed
(03:19:47)<the_ru>Staves two-handed + poles
(03:19:54)<the_ru>Spears poles + piercingo
(03:19:57)<the_ru>or something
(03:19:58)<the_ru>I dunno
(05:52:59)<RotateMe>why does it take so long to xcopy files from one partition to another partition of the same harddrive?
(05:53:06)<RotateMe>it's the same hardware isn't it?
(07:47:30)<purestrain>hmm
(07:47:46)<purestrain>should i use plain 2D SDL? 2D OpenGL oder 2.5D OpenGL ?
(07:52:23)<eMetatoR>depends :P
(07:52:46)<Glowie>2D OGL!
(07:52:47)<eMetatoR>alpha blending stuff and all is possible using plain 2D SDL
(07:53:24)<purestrain>of course hardware intensive
(07:53:33)<Glowie>If you need to rotate stuff or some advanced features, OpenGL is required
(07:53:53)<purestrain>yeah... i'm currently thinking of opengl too...
(07:54:18)<purestrain>now the next choice... stay on 2d tradition or move to 2.5D ? ( planning for a alien breed style game )
(07:55:27)<purestrain>2d has a charme of its own, but 2.5d would allow for nicer graphics
(07:55:30)<Glowie>I'd stick to 2D, it does its job and is easier :P
(07:58:01)<purestrain>2.5d would allow for 'real' walls instead of these 2d ones :-(
(07:59:47)<Glowie>If you're willing to do the extra work, go for 2.5
(08:01:43)<purestrain>do or do not.... there is no try
(09:50:46)<Roor>Hi
(11:32:26)<the_ru>will is everything!
(11:32:51)<the_ru>RotateMe: it has to constantly re-seek between the two locations
(11:33:28)<the_ru>I guess it could be sped up by reading larger chunks at a time
(11:33:53)<the_ru>but I guess xcopy can't do that
(11:34:58)<the_ru>copying between different drives might even be faster
(11:35:14)<the_ru>it's bus speed vs. seek time I guess
(11:36:14)<Roor>Someone alive?
(11:36:21)<the_ru>not really
(11:36:33)<the_ru>heading for bed!
(11:36:41)<Roor>I'm already in bed :P
(11:36:50)<the_ru>so, what are you wearing?
(11:37:13)<Roor>Himitsu ;)
(11:38:50)<Roor>I'm looking fot some help with my "already working" rl... is this the correct place to look for help?
(11:39:43)<the_ru>I suppose so
(11:40:43)<the_ru>The newsgroup(s) are probably better if you have very specific or technical questions
(11:41:04)<the_ru>But this is a good place to just discuss roguelikes in general
(11:41:09)<the_ru>brainstorming and such things
(11:41:16)<Roor>Nope... I'm just looking for someone that may be willing to help with some design aspects.
(11:42:18)<the_ru>the problem with IRC is that most people are usually not watching
(11:42:51)<Roor>I noticed.
(11:43:17)<the_ru>and once something scrolls off screen, it's forgotten
(11:43:23)<Roor>:)
(11:43:40)<the_ru>so the newsgroups are probably better if you actually want a reply :-)
(11:43:53)<Roor>Are you developing something nowadays?
(11:44:28)<the_ru>yes
(11:44:30)<the_ru>it's called TSL
(11:44:38)<the_ru>but now I must depart
(11:44:44)<the_ru>l8r
(11:45:45)<Roor>da zaftra then
+++ The date has changed: 2008/03/30 +++
(07:17:04)<the_ru>does anyone know right away how to make GCC report every missing identifier, not just the first in each function?
(07:23:15)<Aerton>huh? what do you mean? it does exactly that
(07:24:16)<Aerton>it skips following occurences of the already reported identifiers
(07:24:35)<the_ru>Yes, but that was what I meant
(07:27:26)<the_ru>it's annoying when I have to correct one thing, then jump to the next function, loop, then recompile just to get the next slew of errors
(07:27:36)<the_ru>of which most are in functions I've already visited :-(
(07:27:45)<the_ru>but I'm sure it's in the man page... somewhere
(07:28:02)<the_ru>just wondering if anyone knew it by heart :-O
(07:31:23)<Aerton>perhaps, it's buried somewhere deep in the man
(07:31:36)<Aerton>I personally never wanted to have it the other way
(07:32:11)<the_ru>Hm
(07:32:22)<the_ru>I'm moving from hard-coded level sizes to dynamic
(07:33:01)<the_ru>So I want to replace each LEVEL_SIZE_Y with either BOARD_SIZE_Y (for the UI code) or level->size_y
(07:34:08)<Aerton>I see, but why not use search function of an editor?
(07:35:10)<the_ru>I'm not sure how to get a list in emacs that will let me jump
(07:35:23)<the_ru>e.g. grep -n LEVEL_SIZE *.c would do exactly what I want
(07:35:37)<the_ru>Ah
(07:35:49)<the_ru>M-x compile with that command worked :-)
(07:36:01)<TMC>:)
(07:36:07)<Aerton>in vim you press 'n' to jump to the next search result
(07:36:52)<the_ru>but I'll have a look at the identifiers anyway
(07:36:58)<the_ru>vim? pfft
(07:37:06)<the_ru>:-]
(07:37:20)<TMC>pfft :)
(07:37:21)<Aerton>burn the heretic! >:-)
(07:39:30)<TMC>'Spiral path FOV implementation with a Nox style rendering'
(07:39:42)<TMC>anyone know what's meant by 'Nox style'?
(07:40:14)<the_ru>I suppose even a search-and-replace would do it, but I want to do it by hand to catch the borderline cases
(07:40:23)<the_ru>where it's not quite UI, not quite game logic
(07:40:35)<the_ru>probably one that's like the game Nox
(07:41:16)<the_ru>It has FOV, but I never understood why as the screen is quite small already
(07:42:34)<TMC>then use query-replace!
(07:43:10)<the_ru>I need to do it across many files
(07:43:11)<TMC>ah, a game
(07:43:54)<TMC>well, you can run query-replace on a lsit fo files then :P
(07:46:18)<TMC>ah ha
(07:46:20)<TMC>dired-do-query-replace-regexp
(07:47:43)<the_ru>how do I select files?
(07:48:05)<the_ru>with dired I guess, but once there, what do I do?
(07:58:05)<TMC>hmmm
(07:59:17)<the_ru>well, I'm done anyway :-)
(07:59:50)<the_ru>but now, a question arises
(08:00:42)<the_ru>with levels that are larger than the screen, should I let each individual spell, etc, that needs to draw stuff, compensate for the window offset, or should I leave it all to the UI code?
(08:00:50)<the_ru>the answer is obvious, I suppose
(08:03:33)<TMC>I don't think I follow
(08:04:25)<the_ru>with a large map, I need to have a "window" that displays whatever part I'm on
(08:04:29)<TMC>you mean, whether you should draw stuff directly to the screen, having to take into account screen margins and things, or draw to a buffer?
(08:05:11)<the_ru>well, my map is at 0,0, so that wouldn't be much of a problem
(08:05:31)<TMC>and, dired-mark-files-regex is a good way to mark files
(08:05:32)<the_ru>but if the window is 20 tiles from the top, 20 tiles from the left edge
(08:05:42)<TMC>(% m by default)
(08:06:31)<the_ru>I guess I should let the UI code worry about the offset
(08:06:46)<TMC>well.. you could provide wrappers for curses or whatever
(08:07:05)<the_ru>I already have... for most things
(08:07:19)<the_ru>but it clearly belongs in the UI code, right?
(08:07:29)<TMC>what does, the map window?
(08:07:43)<the_ru>the other code shouldn't have to worry about how the map is displayed
(08:07:45)<the_ru>yes
(08:08:02)<TMC>well you could just add some checks to your curses wrappers
(08:08:06)<Aerton>just tell UI to draw at the map coords and let it figure out actual screen position
(08:08:09)<TMC>so that there's an active 'window' onscreen
(08:08:35)<TMC>*some checks and variables
(08:10:01)<the_ru>I don't have a lot of code that does that, actually
(08:10:14)<the_ru>the missile/magic path code is all that comes to mind
(08:12:34)<the_ru>that's the hardest part of writing a roguelike, IMO - keeping the logic and UI in sync
(08:12:48)<the_ru>without tying the logic to the UI
(08:17:54)<the_ru>hm
(08:18:07)<the_ru>so how should I handle things that happen outside the window
(08:18:29)<the_ru>I mean, I have a can_see() function that determines what the character sees
(08:18:36)<the_ru>but what about the things the player doesn't see?
(08:19:40)<the_ru>or will it be a problem - the LOS should be quite limited anyway
(08:36:06)<the_ru>oh great
(08:36:16)<the_ru>I get random 0x1 pointers everywhere
(08:36:22)<the_ru>at least I'll have something to do today
(08:39:05)<the_ru>ah
(08:39:10)<the_ru>'twas the LOS code
(08:40:52)<the_ru>it got a bit disheartening there for a while
(08:41:09)<the_ru>"hm, it broke. so what did I change? oh, only a couple hundred lines of code"
(08:42:31)<deveah>my LOS has a big problem: the data it makes is stored in an array like (x,y) - but my RL also has camera view - so the game crashes when the array reaches a negative pointer'
(08:43:18)<deveah>and also, the LOS doesn't correspond to the camera offsets made
(08:43:26)<deveah>it sees walls where they aren't
(08:44:32)<the_ru>my creatures have individual LOS
(08:44:47)<the_ru>now I just need to modify the code to work with dynamic map sizes
(08:45:08)<the_ru>before they had a LOS array the size of the map, but that won't work anymore
(08:45:15)<deveah>why individual LOS? so when the player gets in view, they attack?
(08:45:31)<the_ru>that's the plan, yes
(08:45:43)<the_ru>it "works" but there's still much work to be done
(08:46:04)<deveah>well if a monster gets in the player view, the player is in the monster's view (if the LOS radius is the same)
(08:46:20)<deveah>why individual LOS when you can use only player's LOS?
(08:46:29)<the_ru>allies
(08:46:52)<deveah>what do you mean?
(08:49:44)<the_ru>you can summon creatures and such things
(08:49:57)<the_ru>and they need their own LOS
(08:50:19)<the_ru>also, you can do things that attract monsters attention, if if they can't see *you*
(08:50:46)<deveah>oh
(08:51:13)<the_ru>I have individual LOS, individual nightvision (the tiles close to you are visible even without any source of light)
(08:51:33)<the_ru>I also have per-level light
(08:52:09)<the_ru>so a monster can see one of your allies standing on a lit tile far away
(08:52:36)<the_ru>... the AI isn't very good yet though :-)
(08:56:15)<the_ru>I also have some vague plans for things like telepathic links, that will combine your LOS with that of other creatures
(08:56:21)<the_ru>but that's really low priority
(08:58:27)<the_ru>whoa
(08:58:34)<the_ru>this is one of those weird moments
(08:58:51)<the_ru>it seems like I have code for certain creatures blocking LOS
(08:58:57)<the_ru>but I don't remember writing it :-/
(09:01:03)<TMC>hi
(09:01:10)<the_ru>hi
(09:05:48)<TMC>heh
(09:16:20)<deveah>i know how i can do it!!!
(09:17:03)<deveah>instead of calculating the los in a specified grid, i make a loop checking for walls - then the LOS just sees if the walls can be seen
(09:17:17)<deveah>so it's impossible to have negative indexes!
(09:17:23)<deveah>i rulz j00!
(09:19:36)<deveah>hey TMC, what do you say about a BAM-like game?
(09:22:00)<TMC>BAM

(09:23:05)<deveah>and eXtendedModule rips ass
(09:23:16)<deveah>nothing -i'm improving RoRLE
(09:23:30)<deveah>and tracking music too
(09:24:12)<the_ru>anything I might have heard?
(09:24:27)<deveah>well they're a lot of .xms
(09:25:30)<TMC>ah
(09:25:35)<TMC>are you going to do anything with it?
(09:26:07)<deveah>"Anii '90!" ; "Crypt scifi horror ingame tune" ; "EndOfFile" ; "Klingonian Joy" ; "Levelup!" ; "Pixelled nightmare" ; "Relax" ; "Tehrevv" and "Weep Ramm"
(09:26:22)<deveah>well they're mainly for my demogroup
(09:26:23)<the_ru>doesn't ring any bells
(09:26:42)<deveah>because I made 40% of them this week
(09:26:59)<the_ru>that explains it
(09:27:08)<deveah>and there's "Rockdud" - for testing my metal samples
(09:28:01)<deveah>chipmusic ftw!
(09:28:42)<deveah>i'll upload them on modland
(09:29:31)<deveah>oh, only 6 milion artists on modland
(09:30:56)<TMC>huh?
(09:30:58)<deveah>oh, only access denied
(09:31:11)<deveah>ftp.modland.com/pub/modules
(09:31:28)<TMC>ok
(09:31:33)<TMC>I meant RoRLE

(09:32:08)<deveah>RL lib for Freebasic - includes LOS, cave and forest generator
(09:33:20)<TMC>yes

(09:33:47)<deveah>altrough Fridge is based on it
(09:36:53)<TMC>ok
(09:36:56)<TMC>got any plans?
(09:37:05)<deveah>yes, NanoRL
(09:38:13)<deveah>with BAM-like tileset
(09:38:23)<deveah>i mean the blocks, ofcourse
(09:38:53)<TMC>:S
(09:39:00)<TMC>I tried to play BAM, couldn't
(09:39:10)<deveah>me neither
(09:40:17)<deveah>NanoRL - or a quick roguelike about the Saviour of Ardeal (1st nationalist roguelike maybe)
(09:41:06)<deveah>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ro/e/ee/Transilvania_si_Banat.png - you see, hungerians want the orange part
(09:42:07)<TMC>oh no!
(09:43:16)<deveah>George Pruteanu made a law, so that if you're living in Romania, you're forced to learn Romanian
(09:43:22)<deveah>he recently died :(
(09:44:54)<deveah>you see -  http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine:Romanian_provincies.jpg - all the yellow part *was* Romania, but the world forces don't want anyone in the Eastern Europe big as us - so they're trying to split us
(09:48:33)<purestrain>splitting the world into smaller manageable chunks
(09:50:14)<deveah>yes, like Kosovo now
(09:50:32)<deveah>and Kosovo is supported mainly by filthy huns that want Transylvania
(10:05:28)<the_ru>so I've broken my LOS
(10:05:29)<the_ru>great.
(10:08:18)<deveah>how many of you are against Kosovo's Independency?
(10:08:33)<the_ru>does it matter?
(10:08:50)<deveah>yes, it does
(10:08:56)<purestrain>i'm against everything which does not strengthen germany :P
(10:09:05)<deveah>where are you from?
(10:09:08)<deveah>the_ru?
(10:12:02)<TMC>ha

(10:15:43)<the_ru>Sweden
(10:16:19)<the_ru>I'm against pointless political arguments online, since it just reduces us all to flaming morons

(10:18:33)<the_ru>they make a lot of noise considering how small part of the population they represent
(10:22:10)<deveah>well you also have a small population
(10:22:17)<deveah>we have 22 milon and you - 8 ?
(10:22:22)<deveah>*milion
(10:22:49)<the_ru>9
(10:23:20)<deveah>then finns are 8, i don't remember
(10:25:44)<TMC>social contract
(10:26:06)<deveah>afk
(10:28:55)<Aerton>the world should be united under my sole reign ^^
(10:31:53)<the_ru>my LOS seems to work now
(10:40:35)<TMC>damn super glue
(10:40:40)<TMC>dangerous stuff
(10:40:49)<TMC>now I have altered fingerprints
(10:41:00)<the_ru>don
(10:41:04)<the_ru>don't snort it
(10:41:08)<TMC>ok
(10:41:12)<TMC>will do
(10:41:15)<TMC>*won't
(10:41:25)<jomiolto>alas, we finns are only 5 million, not 8 :)
(10:41:42)<TMC>hmm
(10:42:16)<TMC>a lot of european countries are less populated than I would ahve though
(10:42:17)<TMC>t
(10:44:32)<the_ru>anyone tried SSHFS?
(10:50:40)<TMC>??
(10:50:57)<TMC>ssh... filesystem?
(10:52:14)<the_ru>yes
(10:56:31)<TMC>never heard of it!
(10:57:50)<the_ru>http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html
(11:02:07)<Aerton>mc capabilities were enough so far
(11:02:14)<TMC>mc?
(11:02:30)<the_ru>midnight commander probably
(11:02:36)<Aerton>midnight commander
(11:02:47)<Aerton>it has ssh support similar to ftp
(11:12:22)<tekateru>well 0irc is baaaad
(11:12:28)<tekateru>but it does the job
(11:12:52)<the_ru>0 irc, as in no irc?
(11:13:08)<tekateru>no, 0irc, the smaller and simpler IRC client for win
(11:14:20)<tekateru>it looks nice but doesn't have a user list
(11:14:29)<the_ru>/names ?
(11:14:42)<tekateru>yes, but doesn't show them on the right side
(11:14:52)<tekateru>NO SUCH COMMAND: NAMES
(11:15:14)<the_ru>use irssi
(11:15:23)<tekateru>too big too big
(11:15:54)<the_ru>for what?
(11:16:00)<tekateru>disk space
(11:16:19)<the_ru>why are you running Windows if you're concerned about disk space?
(11:17:20)<tekateru>well I'd like to use Linux, but this is a multiuser pc and the other person using it doesn't like Linux
(11:17:30)<the_ru>dualboot
(11:17:35)<tekateru>and Linux to me means no games too
(11:17:49)<tekateru>I mean Doom3, TES Oblivion etc
(11:19:18)<Aerton>you are concerned about disk space, but can run oblivion? Oo
(11:19:38)<tekateru>yes
(11:19:53)<Aerton>that does not compute
(11:21:04)<tekateru>I have a 160 gb hd and an 80 one too
(11:21:21)<tekateru>but irssi has 8 mb, and 0irc 200kb
(11:21:37)<tekateru>i'm talking about sizes of things that worth
(11:21:43)<Aerton>and tes like 7gb?
(11:22:15)<tekateru>yes- totally worthy
(11:23:42)<tekateru>xchat was my favourite irc client
(11:23:54)<tekateru>but it was in trial mode :/
(11:24:09)<the_ru>compile it yourself
(11:24:30)<tekateru>hahahahhahahahahhhaha
(11:24:34)<tekateru>you're funny
(11:24:41)<the_ru>what
(11:25:03)<tekateru>I use Dev-Cpp which can't even compile TSL
(11:25:09)<Aerton>installing compiler would take way too much precioussss space ^^
(11:25:10)<the_ru>then get a real compiler
(11:25:16)<the_ru>ah yes
(11:25:19)<the_ru>well, never mind then
(11:26:02)<tekateru>well that, and my pc barely starts now : trojan overflow
(11:26:06)<tekateru>or smth like that
(11:26:09)<the_ru>get a real OS then
(11:26:46)<tekateru>i will - KiwiLinux
(11:27:04)<the_ru>never heard of, but that second part sounds promising
(11:27:24)<tekateru>KiwiLinux is the Romanian Linux
(11:32:14)<the_ru>hm
(11:32:33)<the_ru>in C, can I malloc a 2-dimensional array directly?
(11:33:40)<the_ru>i.e. a ** pointer
(11:34:42)<jomiolto>a ** pointer is not a 2-dim array, but an array of pointers, I think
(11:34:47)<the_ru>hm, yes
(11:34:50)<the_ru>you are correct
(11:34:56)<Aerton>malloc just gives you a chunk of memory, you can cast it to whatever you want
(11:35:18)<the_ru>the first pointer points to an array of pointers, which in turn point to arrays of actual values
(11:35:25)<Aerton>yes
(11:35:49)<the_ru>but how do I access a specific y,x pair then?
(11:35:53)<the_ru>if it's just a chunk
(11:36:34)<Aerton>first, you alloc an array for pointers
(11:37:14)<Aerton>then you make these pointers refer to correct positions in allocated chunk (or use an individual malloc for each one)
(11:37:55)<the_ru>that
(11:38:01)<the_ru>'s what I'm doing now - individual malloc
(11:38:05)<jomiolto>or you can just malloc a single block to a normal pointer and do: pointer[x + y * x_length]
(11:38:21)<jomiolto>but I guess some people don't like that kind of a thing...
(11:38:28)<the_ru>the problem isn't the allocation, but the freeing - I have multiple return points
(11:38:48)<the_ru>I guess I could exchange them for a flag that I check at the end instead
(11:39:07)<Aerton>you'd want dedicated functions to alloc/init and free such things
(11:39:24)<jomiolto>yes, generally you should abstract that kind of things behind functions
(11:40:07)<TMC>cast to array!
(11:40:58)<the_ru>it's a one time thing, this *is* the function for abstraction :-O
(11:42:48)<the_ru>ahaha!
(11:42:50)<the_ru>I got it
(11:43:18)<the_ru>I'll just use the "light" array of the level instead
(11:43:26)<TMC>use
(11:43:29)<the_ru>it's the same type, and it isn't used at this point anyway
(11:43:54)<the_ru>I just create a pointer with another name and point it there, to make it clearer
(11:44:55)<TMC>(int [][XSIZE])malloc(YSIZE*XSIZE*sizeof(int))
(11:45:15)<the_ru>doesn't that require XSIZE to be known?
(11:45:23)<TMC>...yes
(11:45:25)<TMC>:(
(11:45:44)<the_ru>that's the problem - I'm moving to dynamic level sizes :-)
(11:46:09)<tekateru>so what - screenx/mapx+screeny/mapy
(11:46:31)<tekateru>that's what i use
(11:47:51)<the_ru>So, my large maps work
(11:47:51)<TMC>a wrapper is better than a layer of indirection
(11:48:00)<the_ru>10 times as large as the screen!
(11:48:12)<the_ru>now I just need to write some code for recentering the view and it's done
(11:48:35)<TMC>I wish Freebasic had array magic
(11:48:43)<the_ru>... and tune the dungeon generator to work better with large maps ...
(11:48:45)<the_ru>... and ...
(11:48:47)<tekateru>and negative indexes too
(11:50:12)<tekateru>hey TMC, do you want to see my "shortest maze generator in 5 lines" implementation in FB, in just 1 line?
(11:50:20)<tekateru>randomize timer:dim q as integer:for i as integer=1 to 80*25:q=rnd:if q=1 then : print "/";:else : print "\";:end if:next i:sleep
(11:50:25)<tekateru>pwnz0rz
(11:51:04)<the_ru>hm
(11:51:12)<the_ru>I could write my entire game in one line, does that count?
(11:51:37)<tekateru>YES
(11:51:40)<tekateru>please do it
(11:52:06)<TMC>ok!
(11:52:07)<the_ru>I guess it depends on my compiler, but I don't see any reason why not
(11:52:20)<TMC>tekateru, are you deveah? :P
(11:52:26)<tekateru>yes
(11:52:29)<the_ru>why it wouldn't work, I mean
(11:52:46)<the_ru>OTOH, I see no reason to actually try :-/
(11:52:47)<tekateru>deveah + 0irc = tekateru
(11:52:56)<TMC>that array generator is a little dull :(
(11:53:10)<TMC>here's shorter:
(11:54:33)<TMC>wait, how is that 5 lines?
(11:54:53)<TMC>ok, actually that's clever
(11:55:09)<tekateru>5 lines in c++
(11:55:11)<tekateru>1 in FB
(11:55:16)<TMC>pfft
(11:55:22)<TMC>1 line in c++ or c
(11:55:28)<TMC>just remove the newlines
(11:55:34)<TMC>what's the point of that
(11:55:36)<tekateru>do you have that C-to-FB emitter?
(11:55:45)<tekateru>swig-fb
(11:55:46)<TMC>it's in svn
(11:55:51)<TMC>oh
(11:55:52)<TMC>no
(11:55:56)<TMC>why?
(11:56:03)<TMC>I want to go the other direction! :)
(11:57:55)<TMC>if you wanted to write a short maze generator, you shouldn't have used q asa  temp variable
(11:57:59)<TMC>just write
(11:58:21)<TMC>iif(rnd,print "/",print "\")
(11:58:37)<TMC>oh wait
(11:58:42)<TMC>iif(int(rnd),print "/",print "\")
(12:14:28)<tekateru>and you get 1 line!
(12:17:01)<TMC>what
(12:17:18)<TMC>I suppose
(12:19:05)<tekateru>from the mega size 1 line TMC made it just 1 line! microtechnology!
(12:20:11)<TMC>yee-hah!
(12:21:40)<tekateru>this, ladies and gentlemen, is the great 21st century technology: nanobots and 1279-lines-of-code-for-hello-world!
(12:21:54)<TMC>I looked at the source of GNU Hello
(12:22:15)<tekateru>and?
(12:22:37)<TMC>what shocked me was not the round about way to print "Hello, world!", but all the other crap that was in it for reading argument lists and POSIX compliance and things
(12:23:59)<tekateru>well these days we relax in our little ZX Spectrum Basic programming
(12:26:29)<tekateru>at least I do
(12:29:27)<TMC>sounds magical
(12:29:49)<TMC>that would be a good fate for obsolete technology
(12:30:05)<TMC>Hi!
(12:30:19)<TMC>I don't get this 7 day RL playing contest
(12:30:35)<TMC>what if we've already finished some 7drls
(12:30:39)<Glowie>Hi
(12:30:42)<TMC>do we need to do it again to get the points?
(12:31:08)<Glowie>No idea
(12:32:28)<TMC>I really ought to get round to posting on usenet some day
(12:32:59)<jomiolto>what do you think of this fov: http://www.hytti.uku.fi/~jmtoivan/fov.png ?
(12:33:41)<jomiolto>some of the shadows are a bit weird, but at least there doesn't seem to be any nasty artifacts
(12:33:55)<tekateru>http://www.pouet.net/screenshots/50107.png
(12:35:48)<Glowie>The space between two symbols is quite big :P
(12:36:16)<jomiolto>that's because there is a space between the characters :)
(12:36:17)<Glowie>Seems good otherwise
(12:36:21)<Glowie>Oh
(12:36:34)<Glowie>Why would you do that?
(12:36:59)<jomiolto>it's from a console window and I couldn't find a nice font with width=height at a short notice, so I did that cheap trick to get it actually look like a circle :)
(12:37:12)<Glowie>I see
(12:38:58)<TMC>the large difference of width and height in most fonts annoys me
(12:39:07)<TMC>and that it's always ingnored
(12:39:19)<TMC>it seems like it should be an important problem!
(12:40:09)<TMC>hmm, that fov does seem a bit odd
(12:40:31)<TMC>because of the shadows cast by single tile walls
(12:40:52)<jomiolto>yeah, I know, that does seem a bit odd
(12:41:09)<TMC>are you checking visibility of the center point of a tile?
(12:41:12)<jomiolto>but I think it's quite close to a permissive fov
(12:41:46)<jomiolto>no, not really, it's a modification of a simple raycasting algo
(12:42:14)<Glowie>Players won't notice unless the fov is really off :P
(12:42:14)<purestrain>looks quite ok for a tilebased game
(12:43:20)<jomiolto>at least it looks a lot better than my older one that was simple raycasting with bresenham's algorithms :P
(12:45:14)<jomiolto>is there a list of different fov algos somewhere? I'd like to see if this particular idea has been implemented in roguelikes before, or if I actually came up with something new
(12:46:29)<jomiolto>oh, never mind, already found a list at roguebasin
(12:46:39)<TMC>so, what is it?
(12:46:50)<TMC>a tile is lit if a ray is cast through any part of it?
(12:47:45)<TMC>no, that can't be it
(12:48:25)<jomiolto>the idea is to start with only 8 rays and then increase the number of rays as you get farther away from the center of the fov
(12:51:02)<jomiolto>I guess I could write an article about this on roguebasin, or something
(12:51:11)<jomiolto>it might be of interest to someone
(12:51:50)<jomiolto>the algorithm is actually very simple and doesn't require a "real" implementation of neither line nor circle algorithm
(12:53:38)<TMC>what do you mean by that?
(12:54:43)<jomiolto>it does the raytracing recursively, so it doesn't need anything like bresenham's line algorithm
(12:54:50)<Glowie>Is it fast too?
(12:54:56)<jomiolto>I'm not really sure
(12:55:22)<jomiolto>I think it's somewhere in between O(n^2) and O(n^3), but not exactly sure
(12:56:02)<jomiolto>I really need to test it on a bigger map...
(12:57:23)<TMC>you are planning on using bigger maps?
(12:58:02)<jomiolto>not really, but I just want to test how fast it is in practise
(12:58:50)<jomiolto>that 50x50 level on the screenshot takes less than a millisecond to render, so it isn't really a good measure of how quick it is :)
(01:01:57)<TMC>well technically, you should just run it repeatedly (over different maps) rather than over one massive map
(01:02:09)<TMC>though I suppose there's probably no difference
(01:03:08)<jomiolto>oh, I think there's a pretty big difference actually, since this algorithm only goes through actually visible tiles
(01:03:18)<jomiolto>having a lot of walls should make it a lot faster
(01:16:07)<jomiolto>weird, the performance really sucks with a radius bigger than 25 :/
(01:16:21)<jomiolto>r=25 renders in under a millisecond, while r=50 takes 0.4seconds
(01:16:52)<jomiolto>I think there's a bug in the code...
(01:17:15)<TMC>hmmm
(01:20:01)<Roor>Hi
(01:21:59)<Aerton>angband uses something remotely similar
(01:22:15)<jomiolto>ah, no, it's the algorithm. All the recursion makes its execution time grow exponentially :/
(01:22:36)<jomiolto>I think it can be solved, though
(01:22:52)<Aerton>it has a precalculated table that indicated what new rays should be started from every cell
(01:23:18)<Roor>Hi... Are you talking about LOS? (Line of Sight?)
(01:23:43)<Roor>(I just arrived :P)
(01:23:44)<jomiolto>hmm, that's a good idea actually. I think most of this could be precalculated...
(01:23:44)<Aerton>rather, FOV
(01:23:44)<TMC>hi
(01:24:19)<jomiolto>I think I need to check that angband fov and see if it is similar
(01:26:40)<Roor>Hi TMC
(01:30:50)<Roor>I have a little RPG... still in dev, still buggy... check it at www.kaze-net.com/Atinar.rar , please tell me how bad you consider it...
(01:31:01)<Roor>It's an RL of course.
(01:40:00)<jomiolto>wow, I think I came up with a solution, but it's going to complicate the code quite a bit :O
(01:41:03)<jomiolto>but I think I'll have a walk now and meditate more on the idea
(01:41:07)<jomiolto>bye
(01:41:45)<TMC>bye
(01:41:48)<Roor>bye
(01:42:13)<RotateMe>Roor, i like the graphics
(01:42:27)<RotateMe>sound is a no-go for me though :(
(01:42:29)<TMC>looking at it now
(01:42:39)<RotateMe>just died after 2 seconds :D
(01:42:53)<Roor>Not all tiles have yet been implemented... some are still displaying ascii.
(01:43:02)<Roor>Is sound that bad?
(01:43:07)<RotateMe>and some stuff gets cut by the screen
(01:43:33)<Roor>I know, mostly text... because of my incomplete transition from text to gfx :P (yet to be finished)
(01:43:41)<Roor>Most text is still misplaced.
(01:43:49)<RotateMe>well, i had my speakers a bit to high and because there was no music it really shocked me when someone made "humph" in my room ::D
(01:43:53)<Roor>See... it is supposed to run on a PPC.
(01:44:01)<RotateMe>ah i 
(01:44:05)<RotateMe>*ah i c
(01:44:13)<Roor>240x320 on QVGA :P
(01:46:22)<RotateMe>didn't get a thing of what the purple man tried to say
(01:46:31)<TMC>sounds?
(01:46:41)<RotateMe>no the text got cut
(01:46:59)<RotateMe>"... from the cave to the west. but a long time ago an evil..."
(01:47:16)<RotateMe>and the game responds to the keypresses i'm doing here in irc :D
(01:47:40)<TMC>so it does
(01:47:54)<RotateMe>died again :(
(01:48:05)<RotateMe>i shouldn't try to mess with the bandits :D
(01:48:11)<Roor>Try to go to some safer place..
(01:48:32)<Roor>And don't mess with the bandits while you are just "scourge of the valley" :P
(01:48:47)<TMC>no penalty for stealing/
(01:48:48)<TMC>?
(01:49:24)<Roor>Depends if you are caught... it also changes the attitude of the gods towards you...
(01:49:30)<TMC>caught?
(01:49:33)<Roor>Some will like you more.. some will begin to dislike you.
(01:49:40)<Roor>(if someone notices)
(01:49:42)<TMC>I hear "you forgot to pay me 1gp!"
(01:49:54)<TMC>ok
(01:50:03)<Roor>Just try to do the same when there are guards around ;)
(01:50:35)<TMC>I haven't noticed any guards
(01:50:54)<TMC>I think the screen scrolling is confusing
(01:51:02)<Roor>There's no guards on the first little town.
(01:51:44)<Roor>Should it be slower? Or use some transition effect?
(01:51:50)<Roor>or just line by line?
(01:51:54)<TMC>especially when walking diagonally
(01:52:05)<TMC>maybe the camera should track the hero
(01:53:15)<TMC>if you don't want you, alternatively you could move the camera by 1 tile when the player gets fairly close to the edge of the screen
(01:53:25)<TMC>instead of moving in disorientating steps
(01:53:30)<Roor>That's an option I'll consider :)
(01:54:35)<TMC>being able to see more than 1 tile in front of me when standing near the left and right edges would also be very helpful
(01:56:25)<Roor>I'm taking note of all.
(01:56:31)<Roor>what you are saying.
(01:56:56)<Roor>Anyway, nowadays, I hope to clean all the mess with the misplaced texts.
(01:57:09)<TMC>you know... this tiny window is a little annoying to squint at
(01:57:23)<Roor>I worked a couple of weeks on it last year, and I'm taking it over again these days...
(01:57:23)<TMC>a 2x, 3x or even 4x zoom (option) would be good
(01:58:10)<Roor>I already have that one in mind... but a but more accurate zoom option, as well as an option to enlarge the "action screen"
(01:58:24)<Roor>(not sure about the convenience of the last one)
(01:58:46)<TMC>accurate?
(01:59:33)<TMC>I see "(more)" in my inventory screen
(01:59:42)<TMC>is there a second screen? how do I see it?
(02:02:26)<TMC>it seems like you'd have to increase the screen size to fit all the text
(02:04:03)<Roor>Go down/up and left/right... although maybe it just "another" bug there :P
(02:04:15)<Roor>Check the manual to get a hold of the keys.
(02:04:35)<Roor>I told... it is still in dev... and I haven't touched it for sometime.
(02:04:41)<Roor>I'm just resurrecting it :P
(02:04:53)<TMC>ah, of coruse
(02:06:08)<TMC>do you start off with nothing you own equipped?
(02:06:28)<Roor>If you start as a bard, you will begin with a little pet.
(02:06:47)<Roor>I already coded it so you can buy another pets, as well as contract bodyguards...
(02:06:59)<Roor>The original idea was that the hero may hire his own army...
(02:07:11)<Roor>But I never finished implementing the shops for that :P
(02:08:28)<RotateMe>is there some good ai movement algorythm that doesn't use pathfinding?
(02:08:45)<RotateMe>something that makes enemies dodge smaller obstacles?
(02:09:01)<RotateMe>i have come up with something myself but it might not be the best solution
(02:11:11)<Roor>Hmm.. I used pathfinding for that...  if they are just "small" obstacles (one tile) I guess that just forcing it to move diagonally should be enough... or just forcing it to move 2 or 3 times in a perpendicular direction to the target.
(02:11:45)<TMC>one to two tile obstalces are easy
(02:12:17)<RotateMe>yeah in very rare cases the obstacles are bigger and big chunks of units tend to block themselves
(02:12:23)<RotateMe>that's the biggest problem
(02:12:45)<TMC>maybe a cheap trick would work
(02:12:48)<RotateMe>sometimes a big army doesn't attack you on all sides because some are blocking the others
(02:13:35)<TMC>if a monster gets stuck in a corner, it could trigger a flag which forces it to move in the opposition direction for a couple turns, then go perpendicularily to try to escape, and reset
(02:14:10)<RotateMe>i have something like that
(02:14:25)<TMC>and it doesn't work? :(
(02:14:49)<RotateMe>but i have to set flags, so that enemies make place for more enemies when pushed
(02:15:28)<RotateMe>they should try to get around the char so that 8 enemies will attack you at the same time (if you are not standing at a wall)
(02:15:43)<TMC>it sounds like pushing other enemies should work
(02:15:51)<RotateMe>otherwise it reminds of japanese fighting movies: hundreds of guys but only one at a time :D
(02:16:11)<TMC>doesn't it?
(02:16:39)<RotateMe>hmm yeah i could try that
(02:17:07)<RotateMe>problem with direct pushing is that an enemy gets an extra turn, which is not fair
(02:17:42)<TMC>hmm
(02:18:02)<TMC>you could have the pushed enemy lose its turn
(02:18:21)<RotateMe>it's realtime so i can just distribute some penalties
(02:18:44)<TMC>aaah
(02:18:47)<RotateMe>pushing enemies take longer to be able to move again and pushed ones get a small penalty
(02:19:35)<TMC>you could also have enemies follow the wall when they can't move in a straight line
(02:19:51)<TMC>that would easily resolve the surrounding enemies problem
(02:31:43)<RotateMe>ugh i forgot to limit bumping and pushing to enemies near the char (or allies) but now it works pretty good
(02:32:41)<RotateMe>but i did it with a flag, if an enemy next to the char is pushed, he gets a flag and the next time he can do an action, he walks around the char instead of attacking (if able)
(02:36:32)<TMC>so, it isn't actually moved, just sets a bump flag?
(02:36:49)<TMC>that sounds more logical than pushing, actually
(03:04:13)<RotateMe>yep, bump flags
(03:05:22)<RotateMe>but wtf did just happen? i connected a usb hub (which was not even connected to the power) and my laptop went off immediatelly and wouldn't turn on again until i removed the akku and put it back in
(03:05:40)<RotateMe>not even the control light for "connected to power" was working anymore
(03:13:08)<TMC>:S
(03:15:20)<TMC>btw Roor, overall I liked your game, ignoring the numerous usability problems it's looking good so far
(03:17:54)<Roor>Thx a lot
(03:21:36)<TMC>also pretty playable
(03:21:44)<TMC>do you have any grand plans?
(03:21:57)<TMC>any unique gimmicks?
(03:23:26)<Roor>For the time being, I want to finish "fixing" it... completing the tiles, etc...
(03:23:55)<Roor>Then.. as it is a graphical roguelike... I'll add some "fast" gfx effects for magic, missile weapons... maybe blood.
(03:24:09)<Roor>But everything MUST be "fast passed", if you understand what I mean.
(03:24:15)<Roor>(I want a fastpassed game)
(03:24:32)<Roor>After that... I'll go to improve the current virtual theater of the game
(03:25:25)<TMC>fast paced
(03:25:55)<TMC>ok, so the focus is on a detailed setting?
(03:29:17)<TMC>night
(03:31:08)<Roor>I haven't done much on the "story" side.. I'll like to get some hep on that.
(03:31:26)<Roor>Also the RPG system is based on dices... and accept dice notation almost for anything in the game.
(03:31:39)<Roor>So if someone want to make it D&D compliant or something like that... would be welcome.
(03:32:10)<Roor>I like to concentrate on the "engine"... I'll be needing help with the art&creativity side :P
(03:54:45)<RotateMe>if i am debugging with code::blocks, is there a way to stop and see where i am right now?
(03:55:10)<RotateMe>i seem to have an endless loop but i can't find it and there is no such thing as "pause execution" or sth
(03:57:37)<RotateMe>found it
(03:57:55)<RotateMe>man it looks great how those thousands of coloured rats surround you
(03:58:17)<RotateMe>is there any good software to create movies from your desktop?
(03:58:27)<RotateMe>(free)
(04:55:53)<RotateMe>made a small clip but i have too few webspace :(
(04:56:01)<RotateMe>14 mb :P
(04:59:24)<RotateMe>will have to go with youtube :(
(04:59:36)<jomiolto>:(
(04:59:50)<jomiolto>hopefully there aren't small details in the video
(05:00:18)<tekateru>clip about what?

(08:32:21)<jomiolto>hmm, I found a fov algorithm similar to the one I've been working on today: http://www.geocities.com/temerra/los_rays.html
(08:33:24)<jomiolto>I'd really like to check that one out, but the link to the sample code on that page is broken :(
(08:34:39)<jomiolto>and there's no email or anything on the page... does anyone know who wrote that page and how I could contact him/her?
(08:44:48)<Roor>Welcome back tekknej
(08:56:58)<RotateMe>jomiolto, search the newsgroup, i think the guy who made it posted it on rgrd
(08:57:05)<RotateMe>i'm pretty sure of it
(08:58:45)<jomiolto>RotateMe: yeah, I remember that too, but I can't seem to find it :/
(09:01:13)<jomiolto>found it by searching on google with the filename :)
(09:01:41)<jomiolto>its not often you get exactly one hit for your search...
(09:12:23)<the_ru>Hm
(09:12:26)<the_ru>Almost done with my large maps
(09:24:08)<the_ru>Hm
(09:24:16)<the_ru>what kind of scrolling do you prefer?
(09:24:55)<the_ru>I currently have, if you get 5 (x) or 3 (y) tiles from the edge of the visible map, the view recenters on the player
(09:25:16)<the_ru>continuous Crawl-style recentering could be optional, I suppose
(09:27:02)<the_ru>should it recenter both Y and X?
(09:27:08)<the_ru>or just the axis that you move along?
(09:30:37)<the_ru>probably just one axis
(09:41:53)<the_ru>yay
(09:41:55)<the_ru>scrolling works
(09:42:04)<the_ru>now I can build vast wastelands as well!
(09:52:57)<the_ru>something is not right
(10:18:51)<RotateMe>the_ru, i don't like the first option
(10:19:00)<RotateMe>it disturbs my orientation
(10:19:41)<RotateMe>i like it when the camera moves along if you come near the edges but doesn't change position if you are in about the middle of the screen
(10:20:14)<RotateMe>optional you should include "continuous Crawl-style recentering"
(10:27:14)<the_ru>I've changed it so it only scrolls the axis you move along
(10:27:28)<the_ru>i.e. if you move towards the right edge, it will scroll right, but not recenter up/down
(10:27:42)<Kadwiell>The case for continuous recentering is pretty strong in terms of gameplay, even if I aesthetically prefer something else.. in practice, players won't use the look command after every single step, so being close to the edge of the screen arbitrarily limits their view
(10:28:48)<the_ru>well, they won't see outside their LOS anyway
(10:28:55)<the_ru>although that is longer than 3 tiles
(10:29:30)<the_ru>but I don't think I will use this much
(10:29:44)<the_ru>maybe a few enormous areas near the end-game
(10:30:07)<the_ru>but otherwise I'll mostly have screen-sized levels, too keep up the intensity
(10:31:38)<Kadwiell>Probably a good idea, screen-sized levels are great for both gameplay and aesthetics
(10:32:25)<the_ru>I
(10:32:36)<the_ru>I've realised I want outdoor levels as well
(10:32:49)<the_ru>and those don't work too well in 20x40 tiles
(10:35:22)<Kadwiell>I guess not.. still, you have to be careful to avoid people often being attacked from outside the screen and such
(10:36:04)<the_ru>my game has a lot of world travel
(10:36:13)<the_ru>and some of the worlds are towers
(10:36:24)<the_ru>but instead of just dropping the player in the tower with no way to get out
(10:36:45)<the_ru>the portal will be outside the tower, and you can walk in
(10:36:54)<the_ru>and also check of the surroundings
(10:37:06)<the_ru>out
(10:37:23)<the_ru>and my forest temple can actually have a forest around it
(10:37:34)<Kadwiell>Does sound appropriate :)
(10:37:54)<the_ru>and I want a huge, dead city
(10:38:17)<the_ru>only populated by ghouls and other troublemakers
(10:39:22)<Kadwiell>ADOM has non-scrolling outdoors levels, doesn't it? But those do feel somewhat artificial when it comes to combat
(10:40:07)<the_ru>the entire purpose of mine are to give a feeling of vastness :-)
(10:40:48)<Kadwiell>Then I agree that you do need scrolling :)
(10:40:56)<the_ru>so 90% of the game will be screen-sized levels, and the other 10% (the outdoor areas) will be so large that you'll only visit 10% of each :-)
(10:41:36)<the_ru>I wish I'll have time to add my smoke system
(10:41:42)<the_ru>it should limit LOS
(10:41:51)<Kadwiell>Another argument for continuous recentering in your game: it makes it very easy for the player to notice that they're on a scrolling level
(10:41:54)<the_ru>imagine getting lost in an ASCII sandstorm!
(10:42:24)<the_ru>yes
(10:42:25)<Kadwiell>Otherwise a player could stay in a screen-sized area of a scrolling level for a while before realizing..
(10:42:34)<the_ru>well, it shouldn't be too hard to support both
(10:43:18)<Kadwiell>Smoke sounds nice, I think GearHead has it
(10:43:31)<the_ru>but this is where I draw the line - I'm not even trying to write *wrapping* levels
(10:43:35)<the_ru>although they would be nice
(10:43:39)<the_ru>(like in the desert)
(10:43:44)<Kadwiell>TorusRL :)
(10:44:39)<the_ru>or I could do it the easy way
(10:44:50)<the_ru>"A sandstorm sweeps over you!"
(10:44:58)<the_ru>"Your surroundings appear to have changed."
(10:45:05)<the_ru>(the dunes drift)
(10:46:27)<the_ru>and I want an island
(10:46:37)<Kadwiell>Sounds easy, but easy isn't necessarily bad
(10:46:53)<the_ru>circulated by terrible sea monsters!
(10:47:11)<Kadwiell>What did you want to do with wrapping for deserts?
(10:47:41)<the_ru>well, combined with limited sight + continuous scrolling, it'd make it really easy to get lost
(10:48:47)<Kadwiell>Ah, true
(10:48:56)<the_ru>so the only things of interest are the portal and the entrance to a tomb
(10:49:11)<Kadwiell>Pretty confusing for someone who's trying to map out the level, but I guess deserts are meant to be confusing
(10:49:41)<the_ru>it'd be like getting lost in the woods in Adventure :-)
(10:52:30)<Kadwiell>Yeah, I know the sort of puzzle.. they _were_ confusing :)
(10:53:08)<Kadwiell>I think the sandstorm idea is probably better, because continuous movement sort-of makes the player expect that they're controlling movement
(10:53:55)<Kadwiell>That is, that their character moves in a straight line northwards if they press "up" repeatedly, etc.
(10:53:59)<RotateMe>i remember some desert quest in the snes rpg terranigma
(10:54:27)<the_ru>Secret of Mana had a desert too
(10:54:35)<RotateMe>or was it that... ?
(10:54:42)<the_ru>it was slightly annoying since you had to walk around and never really got anywhere
(10:54:51)<RotateMe>yeah than it was som
(10:54:59)<RotateMe>hella annoying, yes ^^
(10:55:03)<the_ru>I woulds
(10:55:24)<the_ru>I wouldn't have "getting lost in the desert" as an intentional challenge though :-)
(10:55:47)<the_ru>the path between the portal and the tomb would be quite straightforward, but if you feel like exploring...
(10:56:46)<the_ru>perhaps the sandstorms could do damage as well
(10:56:58)<the_ru>eventually, you'll collapse
(10:57:05)<Kadwiell>I guess if there are only two things of interest in the entire desert, wrapping would make navigation _easier_ because you could never get too far away from them
(10:57:14)<the_ru>Crematoria in the chronicles of Riddick comes to mind :-)
(10:57:48)<the_ru>there could be some permanent rocks
(10:57:54)<the_ru>and maybe a cave under them
(10:58:25)<the_ru>and there could be cactii that you could chop down and use as a weapon
(10:58:38)<the_ru>and random camels appearing
(10:58:39)<the_ru>...
(10:59:43)<the_ru>genies!
(10:59:56)<the_ru>... but OTOH, I'd like to keep this at least SOMEWHAT original
(11:03:32)<the_ru>I could use it for very rectangulary levels too
(11:03:37)<the_ru>like a gauntlet
(11:03:46)<the_ru>that would only scroll horizontally

(03:56:34)<RotateMe>hi joe
(04:10:04)<joe6pack>hi RotateMe 
(04:10:14)<joe6pack>nuremberg was nice
(04:10:38)<joe6pack>but not really exceptional 
(04:10:54)<joe6pack>just a generic medimu sized german city 
(04:12:33)<joe6pack>the architecture is a bit different from munich and vienna, it looked more like what i imagined switzerland might look like
(04:13:06)<joe6pack>but i've never been to switzerland, so i don't know if that's true 
(04:17:59)<RotateMe>but you had a nice stay there?
(04:18:07)<joe6pack>yea it was nice
(04:18:18)<RotateMe>thats the most important
(04:18:26)<joe6pack>yes i guess so
(04:18:51)<joe6pack>i'm kind of tired of this whole backpacking/youth hostel thing though
(04:18:54)<RotateMe>many unexceptional cities can provide a nice stay just because of the people you meet there
(04:18:59)<RotateMe>:D
(04:19:11)<RotateMe>got some progress on my game
(04:19:18)<joe6pack>\o/
(04:19:26)<joe6pack>screenshots? 
(04:19:29)<RotateMe>surch for aviel on youtube :D
(04:19:47)<RotateMe>screenshots are at htt://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/Aviel/
(04:20:27)<RotateMe>s/htt/http
(04:20:28)<joe6pack>there are 157 aviel vids on youtube
(04:20:42)<RotateMe>doh ;D
(04:20:48)<RotateMe>wait
(04:21:02)<joe6pack>none of the 1st ones look like a computer game :(
(04:21:32)<RotateMe>http://de.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XXETksO0U
(04:22:02)<RotateMe>http://de.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XXETksO0U
(04:22:15)<RotateMe>ugh sry http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/Aviel/
(04:22:28)<joe6pack>cool
(04:22:40)<joe6pack>looks like a lot of zerglings 
(04:27:49)<RotateMe>yeah it was just to check out if the game can handle so many enemies
(04:28:09)<joe6pack>you are using the dorian lib, right?
(04:28:16)<RotateMe>yep
(04:28:32)<joe6pack>is it easy to use?
(04:28:39)<RotateMe>its nice to switch the whole graphics and input problems and get right to the c++ problems
(04:28:41)<RotateMe>very easy
(04:43:22)<the_ru>I'd like to go backpacking
(04:43:31)<the_ru>I'm kind of broke though, and have little time :-/
(04:43:44)<joe6pack>well it's not really expensive 
(04:43:51)<joe6pack>that's the mian reason i do it...
(04:43:57)<the_ru>here it is :-/
(04:44:03)<joe6pack>but it gets old fast
(04:44:11)<joe6pack>whois  the_ru 
(04:44:11)<the_ru>even train is sometimes more expensive than flying!
(04:44:21)<joe6pack>erm
(04:44:33)<joe6pack>doh
(04:44:49)<joe6pack>i was trying to figure out where "here" is by the url
(04:45:29)<joe6pack>erm
(04:45:36)<joe6pack>is that danish?
(04:45:41)<joe6pack>dutch?
(04:46:09)<joe6pack>oh, Swedish 
(04:46:25)<joe6pack>but you can go south
(04:46:37)<joe6pack>and trains are often more expensive than flying in germany 
(04:48:51)<joe6pack>aren't there cheap air lines going from sweden?
(04:50:37)<the_ru>yeah, but how fun is flying?
(04:51:09)<the_ru>I want to see the landscape change
(04:51:19)<joe6pack>i normally take the train as well
(04:51:32)<the_ru>I travelled with my GF across Sweden a few years ago, it was quite fun
(04:51:41)<the_ru>but we weren't very well prepared
(04:51:42)<joe6pack>but that's because it's more effort to get to the air port than to the train station
(04:52:22)<the_ru>I can't easily get to Stockholm either :-/
(04:52:35)<joe6pack>heh
(04:52:39)<the_ru>150 euro just to get there and back
(04:52:45)<joe6pack>if you're stuck in the sricks it's a problem 
(04:52:55)<joe6pack>*sticks 
(04:53:14)<joe6pack>are you in northern SE?
(04:53:20)<the_ru>yes
(04:53:41)<the_ru>I've been driving through the country for two summers now though
(04:53:53)<joe6pack>why on earth would someone want to live there? do you get snow for 8-9 months  every year?
(04:53:53)<the_ru>first with a friend 2006, then with my GF 2007
(04:54:25)<the_ru>the urban areas are too crowded for me
(04:54:30)<the_ru>I like in a city now, though
(04:54:43)<the_ru>I would like to move to a cabin somewhere in the woods, but it's too expensive
(04:54:52)<the_ru>I live, not I like
(04:55:05)<joe6pack>how come? i would reckon it would be very cheap
(04:55:22)<joe6pack>much cheaper than in the city
(04:55:32)<joe6pack>although finding a job would be a problem...
(04:56:15)<joe6pack>huh
(04:56:31)<the_ru>well, I still want electricity and plumbing, so it can't be too far away
(04:56:45)<joe6pack>Stockholm is pretty remote. i figured it would be closer to Copenhagen and Oslo 
(04:57:09)<joe6pack>which city do you live in now
(04:57:10)<the_ru>but those places often go for 30-40k euro and up
(04:57:12)<the_ru>Kiruna
(04:57:32)<the_ru>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiruna
(04:57:39)<joe6pack>jesus christ 
(04:57:46)<joe6pack>that's in the middle of nowhere 
(04:57:52)<the_ru>heh
(04:57:57)<the_ru>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Kiruna.jpg
(04:58:03)<the_ru>you can even see my window there!
(04:58:52)<joe6pack>i wouldn't have been able to tolerate living in a small town for long
(04:59:07)<joe6pack>people tend to be conservative and narrow minded 
(04:59:38)<the_ru>... that's exactly what I think of "big city" people :-O
(04:59:49)<the_ru>conclusion: everyone everywhere is conservative and narrow minded!
(05:00:03)<joe6pack>maybe it's different in sweden
(05:01:04)<joe6pack>in austria people that live in the alpine states are often quite religious and/or racist 
(05:01:57)<the_ru>hm
(05:02:25)<the_ru>well, we aren't like that at least :-)
(05:02:59)<joe6pack>an ex roommate of mine from tirol (which is 26 yo) said she is the only one from her old Tirolean friends that is not married with children 
(05:03:32)<joe6pack>i mean people she went to school with, that are the same age as her
(05:03:48)<the_ru>don't most people have children around that time or earlier?
(05:04:00)<joe6pack>maybe where you are from ;)
(05:04:28)<joe6pack>that's one of the differences between the city and the country  
(05:04:45)<joe6pack>in vienna or berlin most educated people don't have children before 30
(05:06:37)<joe6pack>i'm almost 25 and i can't imagine marrying and having children anytime soon
(05:06:56)<joe6pack>it seems many many years away 
(05:07:06)<the_ru>some here
(05:07:13)<the_ru>though I'm a year younger
(05:07:30)<joe6pack>well i am still 24 officially :)
(05:07:38)<joe6pack>i have about a month left 
(05:08:16)<the_ru>I think it's tradition
(05:08:34)<joe6pack>kids?
(05:08:56)<the_ru>My GF has wanted to have children for several years already, but then she comes from a family where her grandmother was pregnant at 16 and her mother at 20 or so
(05:09:05)<the_ru>My mother was 36 when she got me, so I'm in no hurry
(05:09:11)<joe6pack>heh
(05:09:52)<joe6pack>that's one of my reasons, i don't like "trasitional" values
(05:10:18)<joe6pack>*traditional 
(05:10:31)<joe6pack>also,
(05:10:50)<the_ru>they made up a lot of strange customs in the old days
(05:10:53)<joe6pack>people in the sticks often don't have any culture 
(05:11:41)<the_ru>so what is culture?
(05:12:01)<joe6pack>theater/art/music/indie cinema 
(05:12:04)<joe6pack>museums 
(05:12:21)<joe6pack>i used to live in a small town
(05:12:49)<joe6pack>people there only went out to get drunk or watch hollywood films
(05:13:10)<the_ru>well, there are lots of stuff going on here, but few care about it
(05:14:11)<the_ru>there isn't enough of an audience for any of it to flourish
(05:14:19)<joe6pack>well that's pretty much it. people who are liberal and care at least a bit about culture 
(05:15:34)<joe6pack>that's the thing that annoys me whenever i go visit my parents
(05:16:16)<joe6pack>but at least the last time i was there i found a town ~6km away that has a cinema that shows non-hollywood films
(05:16:42)<joe6pack>and there is a direct bus from a station not far from where they live
(05:16:43)<the_ru>6 km?
(05:16:52)<joe6pack>yes, the closest other town
(05:16:55)<the_ru>the nearest town here is over 100 km away
(05:16:57)<joe6pack>maybe 7 or 8km
(05:17:16)<joe6pack>well they don't live in the middle of nowhere... just not a big city
(05:17:55)<the_ru>well pardon me
(05:17:57)<the_ru>http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=trippin
(05:18:11)<the_ru>Then as if the crew felt that they weren't being condescending enough, they keep saying "I can't believe how far away we are, we're in the middle of nowhere."
(05:18:17)<the_ru>Yeah, I'm sure citizens of Bhutan and Honduras appreciate being told that they live "nowhere."
(05:18:20)<the_ru>;-)
(05:18:26)<joe6pack>:o
(05:18:29)<joe6pack>sorry,,,
(05:18:38)<joe6pack>s/\,/\./g
(05:19:19)<the_ru>I used to live in a more urban area
(05:19:23)<the_ru>along the southern coast
(05:19:37)<the_ru>but all it made me realise was that wherever you live, things become what you make of them
(05:20:12)<the_ru>there are lots of people here complaining that nothing ever happens... yet they completely fail to take part when something actually does happen
(05:20:37)<joe6pack>that's true. but i still rather live somewhere non conformism is at least somewhat tolerated 
(05:21:18)<joe6pack>my problem is not so much with being bored. it is more about the kind of people you meet.
(05:21:23)<joe6pack>for example
(05:21:29)<joe6pack>lets say you were gay
(05:21:53)<joe6pack>would you feel comfortable telling people where you live that?
(05:22:23)<joe6pack>would you feel ok walking down the street holding hands with another man?
(05:23:22)<the_ru>I can't really picture myself in that situation... but yes, why not?
(05:23:23)<joe6pack>in big cities people generally don't care that much where you put your penis
(05:24:05)<joe6pack>well maybe in sweden it is like that, but i am sure in the rural parts of austria/bavaria/israel it wouldn't be very comfertable 
(05:24:32)<the_ru>I think that's because people in cities care less about *everything*
(05:24:36)<the_ru>but yes, I get your point
(05:25:10)<the_ru>although here at least I don't think more people are anti-gays than anywhere else
(05:25:19)<the_ru>most people just don't care
(05:25:43)<joe6pack>sweden is supposidly more liberal than most of europe 
(05:26:14)<the_ru>socially, maybe
(05:26:14)<deveah>I HATE BUSH
(05:26:23)<jomiolto>what's he done now?
(05:26:44)<deveah>He brought his motherfucking NATO summit to Romania
(05:27:05)<deveah>and now noone goes out of Bucharest - and noone goes in because he's sooooo important
(05:27:21)<deveah>now I can't go in the mountains!
(05:27:38)<joe6pack>they≈ïe afraid someone will try to assassinate him
(05:29:58)<joe6pack>in what other ways are they not liberal? 
(05:30:50)<the_ru>economically
(05:31:02)<the_ru>we have the world highest taxes, some people claim
(05:31:23)<joe6pack>that doesn't matter that much to me
(05:31:30)<the_ru>but nobody listens to the libertarian nuts anyway
(05:31:44)<joe6pack>you probably get at least something back because of social services 
(05:31:54)<jomiolto>high taxes = free health care, free education, etc. (usually)
(05:31:56)<joe6pack>liberal != libertarian
(05:32:38)<the_ru>I know, but I actually meant libertarian nuts
(05:33:14)<joe6pack>i am content with the level of social spending in austria 
(05:33:17)<the_ru>but I think our system works quite well
(05:33:39)<the_ru>it can always be more effective and better divided though
(05:33:40)<joe6pack>i think it works well if the country is rich enough
(05:35:29)<the_ru>anyway, people tend to move around a lot here
(05:35:50)<the_ru>right now we have a lot of new people in town because they're building new ore refining plants
(05:36:05)<the_ru>it's basically impossible to get an apartment
(05:36:19)<the_ru>at a fair price, that is
(05:36:57)<the_ru>so we don't really fit the stereotype of isolated, inbred rednecks :-)
(05:37:19)<the_ru>we even have... computers!
(05:37:24)<the_ru>telephone!
(05:37:26)<the_ru>internet!
(05:37:27)<joe6pack>:O
(05:37:27)<the_ru>:-O
(05:37:34)<the_ru>ice cream truck!
(05:39:46)<joe6pack>they probably keep the ice cream in the oven in Kiruna
(05:40:03)<the_ru>:-)
(05:40:34)<the_ru>normal winter temperature is around -20 C
(05:41:07)<the_ru>though it dropped to -45 C for a week a few years ago
(05:41:16)<deveah>a truck is rarely seen where I have the holiday house
(05:41:19)<joe6pack>my problem would be with the lack of sun shine 
(05:41:27)<the_ru>joe6pack: lolwut?
(05:41:30)<the_ru>midnight sun!
(05:41:37)<joe6pack>"where you have"...
(05:41:43)<joe6pack>where your parents have...
(05:41:53)<joe6pack>the_ru: in summer :p
(05:41:56)<joe6pack>and in winter?
(05:41:57)<the_ru>the sun is up from may to august
(05:42:21)<the_ru>for a while in december it never gets above the horizon
(05:42:38)<deveah>joe6pack: yes, my grandmother actually
(05:42:41)<the_ru>but right now we have typical spring weather, bright sunshine at 6 PM
(05:42:43)<joe6pack>sounds depressing 
(05:42:54)<joe6pack>the winter i mean, not the spring 
(05:43:14)<the_ru>everyone is tired around that time
(05:43:39)<the_ru>but I still prefer this over the slush down south
(05:44:00)<joe6pack>depends how far south you go ;)
(05:44:30)<the_ru>at least southern sweden
(05:44:35)<joe6pack>but i agree that -5 to 0 is better than 5-10
(05:44:49)<the_ru>here we get snow, then it usually stays the whole winter
(05:44:51)<joe6pack>at least when it comes to perspiration 
(05:45:00)<joe6pack>snow is much less annoying than rain 
(05:45:09)<the_ru>down there they get rain for a week, then everything freezes, then snow, then it thaws, then it freezes again
(05:45:12)<the_ru>etc etc
(05:45:16)<joe6pack>yea
(05:45:18)<joe6pack>that sucks
(05:45:51)<the_ru>and since we're so high up, we rarely get any strong winds
(05:56:16)<the_ru>heh
(05:56:29)<the_ru>my dungeon generators work great on large maps
(05:56:38)<the_ru>my recursive "catacombs" algorithm looks great
(05:57:14)<the_ru>"divide rooms into smaller rooms" mostly create long corridors, but that's tweakable
(05:58:53)<the_ru>it somehow feels like this is how it was meant to look
(05:59:14)<the_ru>but scrolling really takes attention away from the action
(05:59:58)<the_ru>larger maps would allow more strategic choices though
(06:00:21)<the_ru>right now, if you find a room full of goblins, there usually isn't any way around it
(06:01:32)<deveah>wtf? http://code.google.com/p/roguelulz/
(06:01:57)<the_ru>isn't that joe6pack?
(06:02:31)<deveah>yes, that's why I said: "wtf?"
(06:06:12)<the_ru>horizontal scrolling isn't so bad though
(06:06:44)<the_ru>it's the vertical that's most disorienting
(06:12:31)<joe6pack>deveah: that was for the article i wrote 
(06:13:02)<joe6pack>but i only wrote 1 part :(
(06:28:34)<RotateMe>too bad, looks like a funny idea
(06:28:45)<RotateMe>dammit just had to pay another 500 bucks tuition fee
(06:29:31)<RotateMe>at leat i paid it 1 month late
(06:29:49)<RotateMe>s/leat/least
(06:37:36)<joe6pack>i thought tuition is free in de
(07:01:59)<RotateMe>nope 500 
(07:02:04)<RotateMe>per 6 months
(07:05:14)<joe6pack>really
(07:05:23)<joe6pack>but that not's too bad
(07:20:42)<RotateMe>what do you pay?
(07:20:52)<RotateMe>i think 1000 bucks a year is pretty bad
(07:21:24)<RotateMe>it's exactly the amount of money you could spare to lay aside and make a big investment later on like a flat/car/pc
(07:21:31)<joe6pack>nuck = euro or usd?
(07:21:35)<joe6pack>*buck
(07:21:44)<RotateMe>500 euro
(07:21:58)<joe6pack>i pay ~740 euro per year
(07:22:15)<RotateMe>wow thought vienna would be more expensive
(07:22:42)<RotateMe>well but as my sister parts of her university are in a pretty bad shape
(07:22:49)<RotateMe>that's rarely the case here in germany
(07:23:03)<RotateMe>and in berlin, there are no fees yet
(07:23:58)<joe6pack>oh come on. 500 euros/year for a couple of years won't make a difference in the long run 
(07:24:32)<RotateMe>1000
(07:24:36)<RotateMe>500 per semester
(07:24:39)<RotateMe>(6 months)
(07:25:01)<joe6pack>still
(07:25:04)<joe6pack>not that bad
(07:25:09)<RotateMe>won't make a big difference, but it's not like you have that money when you have to pay it
(07:25:36)<joe6pack>in other countries you'd generally pay a lot more
(07:25:46)<joe6pack>that's what parents are for ;)
(07:25:47)<RotateMe>it's about 15-20% of the whole money i spend
(07:26:31)<RotateMe>well that's what my employer is for atm
(07:26:37)<RotateMe>so it's not a problem for me
(07:26:57)<RotateMe>and for berlin (in case they change the fees) i've laid all money i need for that aside
(07:27:11)<RotateMe>since moving to berlin means quitting my job
(07:28:03)<joe6pack>i don't think there is a single city in the developed world where it will be cheaper to be a stundent in then berlin
(07:28:37)<RotateMe>there isn't
(07:28:51)<RotateMe>well depends on what you count as developed world
(07:29:02)<joe6pack>in america you'd pay >10000/year
(07:29:05)<RotateMe>prag is hell of a cheap city to study
(07:29:22)<joe6pack>western europe/north america/japan/etc.
(07:29:27)<RotateMe>well either rich or sponsored people study there
(07:29:38)<joe6pack>hrm
(07:29:42)<RotateMe>it's not like someone would pay for the tuition fees there themselves
(07:29:58)<joe6pack>yea maybe you can find some place in post communist cenral europe like prague 
(07:30:24)<joe6pack>there == prague?
(07:30:36)<joe6pack>or the us?
(07:30:53)<RotateMe>in the us
(07:31:25)<RotateMe>i can't believe someone is making this amount of money on his/her own being a student
(07:31:38)<joe6pack>student loans 
(07:31:48)<joe6pack>they pay back for years and years after graduation 
(07:31:57)<joe6pack>or the parents save for 20 years 
(07:32:18)<RotateMe>does the state give out these loans?
(07:32:27)<joe6pack>i don't know.
(07:32:33)<RotateMe>it's hard to get a few hundred bucks per month here as a loan
(07:32:42)<RotateMe>this amount would be impossible
(07:33:15)<joe6pack>you can get stipends as well, but i know that a lot of americans&canadians leave uni with a huge debt that takes >10 years to pay off
(07:34:07)<joe6pack>i think my canadian ex-roommate only payed back his student loans in his 30's
(08:03:55)<deveah>i'm gonna play Diablo][
(08:04:02)<joe6pack>have fun
(08:04:10)<joe6pack>never got much into that one
(08:04:23)<joe6pack>i played 1 a lot though 
(08:07:32)<the_ru>same here
(08:07:49)<the_ru>I lost interest right before Diablo
(08:08:04)<the_ru>I was a sorceress, and there were no mana potions for some reason :-/
(08:08:27)<the_ru>Anyway, I guess that's a good thing with high taxes: free university
(08:08:44)<the_ru>or actually, free school alltogether
(08:19:23)<the_ru>I think I'll keep horizontal scrolling
(08:19:42)<the_ru>for most levels
(08:19:58)<the_ru>my catacombs and sewers get much more realistic if they're really large
(08:20:32)<the_ru>but perhaps I should make each area only one level deep
(08:20:50)<the_ru>now I have 3 levels of dungeon, 3 levels of catacombs, 3 levels of caves, etc
(08:21:01)<joe6pack>nice
(08:21:56)<the_ru>but why not vary
(08:22:08)<the_ru>the first levels could be screen-sized, then get larger
(08:22:21)<the_ru>the deeper you go, the harder it is to find your way?
(08:23:24)<RotateMe_dogwal>yep, why not, sounds good
(08:23:41)<the_ru>there's only one way to find out? :-)
(08:23:58)<RotateMe>can the word melee be used for both armed and unarmed damage?
(08:24:26)<joe6pack>i would use hand to hand combat
(08:24:42)<joe6pack>for unarmed 
(08:24:56)<the_ru>wikipedia says:
(08:24:58)<the_ru>Melee (from the French m√™l√©e IPA: [m…õle]) generally refers to disorganized close combat involving a group of fighters. A melee ensues when groups become locked together in combat with no regard to group tactics or fighting as an organized unit; each participant fights as an individual.
(08:25:28)<joe6pack>seems ok then
(08:25:32)<the_ru>in RPG terms, melee traditionally refers to armed combat, and hand-to-hand to unarmed
(08:25:44)<joe6pack>but i think most rl players expect melee to be swords and axes
(08:25:48)<the_ru>yes
(08:26:23)<Roor>I though that melee, in RPGs,  would be something just like "short range".
(08:29:04)<joe6pack>i think both interpretations are acceptable 
(08:48:37)<the_ru>my tongue is all swollen and shit
(08:49:06)<the_ru>I have some kind of wound on the inside of my cheek
(08:49:15)<the_ru>I must have bit myself or something
(08:50:01)<deveah>is "Aoleu" a good name for a roguelike?
(08:50:12)<deveah>like Aoleu!
(08:50:14)<joe6pack>maybe you have herpes
(08:50:25)<jomiolto>well, I don't know, but that made me immediately think of areola :P
(08:50:29)<the_ru>aoeu is a good start for a keyboard at least
(08:51:30)<deveah>aoleu! is an interjection meaning something like Yikes! and OMG! and ROFL! and noshit! but all together
(08:52:19)<joe6pack>never heard it
(08:52:33)<deveah>because it's romanian only :)
(08:52:39)<jomiolto>in that case name your roguelike zomgrofl, or something like that :)
(08:53:00)<jomiolto>or even better zomgrofl!!!1
(08:53:29)<deveah>if zomg = zombies oh my god then it's fine
(08:54:02)<jomiolto>zomg = omg with a z in front of it (don't ask me why, but I've seen it used instaed of omg several times)
(08:56:02)<deveah>well ZoMgG!G!!11!#133!!!11 (Zombies Oh My God!1!!%51$614!!) is a long but good title
(08:56:09)<deveah>cya
(08:57:47)<jomiolto>fake?
(08:58:02)<jomiolto>how is it fake?
(08:58:10)<the_ru>the person doesn't exist
(08:58:24)<jomiolto>oh, you mean like an anonymous one?
(08:58:33)<jomiolto>something with made up stuff?
(08:58:35)<the_ru>Nah, it has to appear sincere
(08:58:58)<jomiolto>oh, why?
(08:59:04)<the_ru>Some one appearently wants to "fuck my girlfriend" :-O
(08:59:11)<jomiolto>:(
(08:59:27)<the_ru>Really, his nick is "I want to fuck you"
(08:59:35)<the_ru>I'm creating this "Amanda" person
(08:59:45)<the_ru>let's see if it's all talk or if he's up to it :-)
(09:00:33)<jomiolto>heh, I've used a similar technique in a chat room once, when I was chatting with a nice girl and then an annoying *sshole came in and started harassing her with all kinds of stupid stuff
(09:02:24)<the_ru>/ignore ?
(09:02:24)<jomiolto>omg, it was daveah! :D
(09:02:40)<jomiolto>the_ru: not in IRC, but in a webchat
(09:03:04)<joe6pack>the_ru: ? where did you encounter that person?
(09:03:20)<the_ru>joe6pack: I didn't. My GF did
(09:03:39)<joe6pack>chat room troll?
(09:03:43)<the_ru>Every once in a while some moron shows up on her list and wants to demonstrate his dick or something
(09:03:54)<the_ru>No, MSN
(09:03:59)<joe6pack>oh you mean msn chat
(09:04:05)<joe6pack>ok
(09:04:13)<joe6pack>can't she just block him?
(09:04:22)<the_ru>Yeah, that's no problem
(09:04:35)<the_ru>I'm just curious if I can talk him into giving me his real name and stuff
(09:04:41)<joe6pack>oh ok
(09:04:48)<joe6pack>and give him a visit or a phone call
(09:04:48)<the_ru>send a log home to his parents? :-)
(09:05:21)<joe6pack>i thought more like punching him in the face
(09:05:49)<the_ru>not worth it
(09:05:56)<joe6pack>guess so
(09:06:06)<the_ru>it happened in RL though
(09:06:08)<the_ru>this summer
(09:06:13)<the_ru>some guy was following her around
(09:06:42)<joe6pack>you kicked his ass?
(09:06:46)<the_ru>no
(09:06:49)<the_ru>went to the police
(09:06:56)<joe6pack>so how is it the same
(09:07:07)<the_ru>what?
(09:07:11)<joe6pack>21:12:54 < the_ru> it happened in RL though
(09:07:18)<the_ru>yeah
(09:07:31)<the_ru>well, the anonymous dick flashers online are quite harmless
(09:07:37)<joe6pack>i thought you mean the "punch him the face" comment
(09:07:38)<the_ru>at least they're easy to get rid of
(09:07:55)<the_ru>well, it could have happened
(09:08:00)<joe6pack>:)
(09:08:06)<the_ru>but he seems to have given up now
(09:08:11)<the_ru>I haven't, though
(09:08:30)<the_ru>I have a pretty good idea where he lives, I drive through there whenever I'm in the area
(09:08:44)<the_ru>it doesn't hurt to know where to find him in case he gets any ideas again
(09:08:54)<joe6pack>the one who was stalking her?
(09:09:18)<the_ru>well, "stalking"... more like just annoying any girl he encountered
(09:09:43)<the_ru>the police I talked to was kind of cool
(09:10:03)<joe6pack>did he scare him a bit?
(09:10:04)<the_ru>"well, it looks like he's trying to propose, but doesn't know how it works around here... you could show him, late some night"
(09:10:27)<the_ru>they couldn't find him, even when I gave them photos
(09:10:50)<the_ru>but it felt like a good idea to get it written down by the police, in case I *have* to kick his ass someday
(09:11:07)<the_ru>at least I have tried to solve it in a peaceful way
(09:11:19)<the_ru>and as we all know, doing the quests properly gives the most experience
(09:11:21)<joe6pack>typical. the police doesn't give a shit about anything 
(09:12:16)<joe6pack>is sweden a gun loving country like finland?
(09:12:32)<the_ru>not quite
(09:12:34)<jomiolto>finland gunloving? how come?
(09:12:38)<the_ru>there are some weapons around here though
(09:12:46)<the_ru>but mostly just hunting rifles
(09:12:56)<joe6pack>i've heard that in finland a lot of people carry guns 
(09:13:30)<joe6pack>that the precentage of gun ownership is high relative to most other countries 
(09:13:58)<jomiolto>hmm
(09:14:13)<joe6pack>damnit again classes at 10:00 tomorrow 
(09:14:16)<jomiolto>there are a lot of people that hunt with guns, but otherwise I think it's quite rare for a finn to have a gun
(09:14:30)<jomiolto>and I think the laws are quite strict too
(09:14:40)<the_ru>I doubt it's legal to just carry one around for no reason?
(09:14:54)<jomiolto>I'm almost certain that it is not
(09:15:11)<the_ru>Here you basically have to take them apart and store the parts locked up at different locations
(09:15:17)<the_ru>and hide the keys
(09:15:24)<joe6pack>"In Finland there are 32 privately owned firearms per 100 civilians according to the Finnish Ministry of the Interior[1][2]. By the end of 2006 there were somewhat over 1,6 million licensed firearms and spread among Finland's population of 5,3 million it comes to 30,5 per 100 people. Unlicensed firearms are estimated at around 1,5 per 100. There are some 650,000 firearms permit holders in Finland."
(09:15:48)<jomiolto>yeah, I just found that Wikipedia article too :)
(09:16:30)<jomiolto>"According to law, the firearms must be stored in a locked space or otherwise locked, or with vital parts removed and separated. Even then the weapon or any of its separated parts must not be easily stolen."
(09:16:55)<jomiolto>"They may be carried only when they are transported from their place of storage to the place of use (shooting range, hunting area or such). Even then they must be unloaded and concealed or kept in carrying pouches."
(09:17:27)<jomiolto>so it seems that we *do* have a lot of guns here, but the laws are quite strict on their usage and storage
(09:18:00)<the_ru>it's a big hassle here to even have old guns for decoration
(09:18:00)<jomiolto>oh, and: "To obtain a firearms license, an individual must declare a valid reason to own a gun."
(09:18:12)<the_ru>even if you plug the barrel, there are tons of paperwork that need to be done
(09:18:19)<joe6pack>i think that's in most places though
(09:18:30)<the_ru>"But I'm angry now!" -Homer
(09:18:41)<jomiolto>"Permits are not required for muzzle-loaded black powder guns made before 1890 as long as they are not used." :D
(09:19:13)<jomiolto>I wonder how many people have such things :)
(09:20:12)<joe6pack>probably just for decoration 
(09:20:21)<the_ru>Heh. At work it's not unusual for someone to bring out a shotgun during lunch hour
(09:21:10)<joe6pack>you just said it was a hassle to carry a weapon...
(09:21:23)<the_ru>Carry?
(09:21:25)<the_ru>I said own
(09:21:40)<the_ru>But these guys are hunters, so they have all the papers
(09:21:40)<joe6pack>oh ok. i mixed you with jomiolto 
(09:22:06)<the_ru>Once this guy wanted to show us his rifle
(09:22:24)<the_ru>As he cocked it, another colleague yelled from his room down the corridor: "Now that's a sound I like!"
(09:23:14)<the_ru>He should be glad it wasn't the same day there was a bomb threat in the building across the street
(09:23:29)<the_ru>The police came up to us and told us to stay away from the windows :-)
(09:25:07)<joe6pack>lolwhat? bomb threat in Kiruna?
(09:25:13)<the_ru>That's one of the good things about Kiruna; everyone considers such things normal
(09:25:22)<the_ru>bringing a rifle to work that is, not bomb threats
(09:25:23)<joe6pack>why on earth would someone plant bombs in building there?
(09:25:36)<the_ru>well, of course it wasn't a real bomb
(09:25:51)<the_ru>they have a post office there that deal with undeliverable mail from the whole country
(09:26:15)<the_ru>it was a stuffed animal with some electronics that they mistook for a bomb
(09:26:40)<the_ru>it had been sent to some suspicious address and then bounced around the postal system for a while
(09:27:11)<the_ru>and a week later they got an anthrax alarm :-O
(09:27:20)<the_ru>but it was just some flour or similar
(09:27:27)<joe6pack>heh
(09:27:55)<the_ru>I mailed a pizza to a friend once
(09:28:02)<jomiolto>:D
(09:28:19)<the_ru>he worked at the post office though, so he just wrote "undeliverable" and returned it my address :-/
(09:28:24)<joe6pack>why would they transport the mail to somewhere so far away from most of the population? wouldn't it make more sense to put it in the middle of the country 
(09:28:29)<the_ru>so when I got home a week later there was a pizza in my mailbox
(09:28:38)<joe6pack>eek
(09:28:43)<joe6pack>week old pizza...
(09:28:52)<the_ru>it was a microwave pizza
(09:29:08)<the_ru>it's for political reasons, I guess
(09:29:42)<the_ru>they're relocating certain services and authorities here
(09:30:01)<the_ru>as compensation for closing down our regiment
(09:31:01)<joe6pack>do you have a lot of natives there?
(09:31:12)<the_ru>natives?
(09:31:16)<the_ru>the sami?
(09:31:32)<joe6pack>lapps
(09:31:33)<joe6pack>yes
(09:31:53)<the_ru>not really
(09:32:12)<the_ru>of course there are a lot of them, but they've mostly merged with the rest of us
(09:32:19)<the_ru>I'm 1/8, for example
(09:32:43)<the_ru>Hm, no wait
(09:32:46)<the_ru>I'm 1/4 actually
(09:33:33)<joe6pack>grandmother?
(09:33:38)<the_ru>grandfather
(09:33:49)<the_ru>but it's not really something that matters in everyday life :-)
(09:34:12)<joe6pack>i hope not ;)
(09:34:43)<the_ru>they are kind of racist, though - they have certain rights and they only want "pure" sami to use them
(09:35:39)<joe6pack>there is something like that for bedouin in israel. they are allowed to hunt certain animals that are not allowed for others
(09:36:04)<the_ru>yes, things like that
(09:36:42)<the_ru>it's understandable they guard their rights though, considering how they've been treated in the past
(09:37:15)<the_ru>... I guess that can be said about almost any native population
(09:37:25)<joe6pack>yea pretty much
(09:37:53)<the_ru>there was a course in their language, some time back
(09:38:00)<the_ru>I wanted to go but didn't have the time
(09:42:39)<joe6pack>in israel the government tried to put them in reservations in the 1950s and 1960s 
(09:42:48)<joe6pack>which didn't go to well, obviously 
(09:43:55)<joe6pack>then they tried to just make them live in 1 place (as opposed to being nomads), which worked a bit better
(09:45:10)<joe6pack>the biggest bedouin city is only a few km from where i went to uni, so there were relatively a lot of them in my school
(09:45:23)<joe6pack>most women it seems
(09:45:26)<joe6pack>i don't know why
(09:45:33)<joe6pack>*mostly 
(09:46:20)<joe6pack>normally in such societies there is a social preference for males to get an education
(09:46:28)<joe6pack>so it's a bit odd
(10:05:06)<RotateMe>dammit, writing the functions for handling 8 attributes is a hell lot of copy/paste
(10:05:22)<RotateMe>something generic won't do it before you say it ;p
(10:05:49)<joe6pack>i am sure it will ;)
(10:06:27)<joe6pack>if you are using *a lot* of copy&paste you are probably doing something wrong 
(10:07:07)<RotateMe>    sub_console->printLeft(PRINT_ATTRIBUTES_X,6,TCOD_BKGND_NONE,"%i",player->getMeleeDamage());
(10:07:07)<RotateMe>    sub_console->printLeft(PRINT_ATTRIBUTES_X,7,TCOD_BKGND_NONE,"%i",player->getMeleeAttackSpeed());
(10:07:07)<RotateMe>    sub_console->printLeft(PRINT_ATTRIBUTES_X,8,TCOD_BKGND_NONE,"%i",player->getRangedDamage());
(10:07:07)<RotateMe>    sub_console->printLeft(PRINT_ATTRIBUTES_X,9,TCOD_BKGND_NONE,"%i",player->getRangedAttackSpeed());

(10:07:11)<RotateMe>    sub_console->printLeft(PRINT_ATTRIBUTES_X,12,TCOD_BKGND_NONE,"%i",player->getMovementSpeed());
(10:07:13)<RotateMe>just stuff like that
(10:07:39)<RotateMe>but it's hell of annoying if you find out something is wrong and have to change everything
(10:07:49)<RotateMe>eg. the "%i" argument
(10:08:33)<joe6pack>print(size,value){ sub_console->printLeft(PRINT_ATTRIBUTES_X,size,TCOD_BKGND_NONE,"%i",value); }
(10:08:55)<joe6pack>print(6,player->getMeleeDamage() );
(10:09:13)<joe6pack>print(7,player->getMeleeAttackSpeed() );
(10:09:15)<joe6pack>etc..
(10:09:53)<joe6pack>less copy-paste ;)
(10:10:38)<RotateMe>yeah, before i just had Str Dex Vit and Mag but i decided that a simple roguelike doesn't need them to calculate the sub attributes
(10:10:55)<RotateMe>now i just use the subattributes and let levelups and equipment effect them directly
(10:11:08)<RotateMe>which also makes balancing the game easier
(10:11:31)<joe6pack>i don't see what that has to with it
(10:12:29)<RotateMe>well changing dex makes monsters faster and their attacks more accurate
(10:12:36)<RotateMe>maybe you just want to make them faster
(10:13:08)<joe6pack>no i mean i don't see what this has to do with what we were talking about (copy pasting code)
(10:13:53)<RotateMe>for 4 attributes i won't write generic functions
(10:14:14)<joe6pack>i would if it ended up saving chars
(10:14:17)<RotateMe>it's the magical border ;)
(10:14:26)<joe6pack>mine is normally 2 
(10:15:19)<joe6pack>especially when the "generic function" is something so simple like what you pasted here
(10:16:33)<RotateMe>well the drawing functions are in a class so i'd have to declare them alone at two places
(10:16:41)<RotateMe>so 2 would be a bit too much for me
(10:16:57)<joe6pack>what?
(10:17:04)<joe6pack>declare them alone at two places?
(10:18:55)<RotateMe>eh declare and implement them at different places
(10:19:14)<RotateMe>that's how i do it at least i know you could implement them on declaration
(10:19:33)<RotateMe>but then i'd need to #include files in the headers that have nothing to do there ...
(10:20:52)<joe6pack>it sounds like you are doing something in a suboptimal way. but i think you should let it bite you in the ass in a couple of weeks/months so that you learn your lesson ;)
(10:22:08)<joe6pack>maybe the design of your classes in not suitable for your purposes, i don't know 
(10:22:51)<RotateMe>nah it's just that i don't implement in headers
(10:22:58)<joe6pack>you shouldn't 
(10:23:10)<joe6pack>that's not the solution 
(10:23:26)<RotateMe>that's why i don't :D
(10:23:40)<joe6pack>i am saying that it soundsd like there is a better solution, but i can't tell you which one it is because i don't know your code base
(10:24:40)<RotateMe>i don't think there is because i don't care about hiding class methods/attributes, it's all pubclic and everything is accessed from everywhere
(10:25:20)<RotateMe>but the codebase won't grow much larger than it is now, and if it's biting me in the ass in a few weeks/months i failed anyway because it's supposed to be finished soon ;)
(10:29:28)<joe6pack>ok
(10:29:32)<joe6pack>good luck :)
(10:30:05)<RotateMe>or did you mean something else?
(10:30:35)<RotateMe>if it has to do with headers and source, you're right, i don't really know what i'm doing there
(10:31:35)<joe6pack>i meant that even if you do it wrong it's ok because doing it wrong will teach you to do it right next time
(10:33:54)<RotateMe>i think so, but i think concerning c++ specific code arrangement there will be no other way but a good book or tutorial
(10:34:24)<joe6pack>and experience from doing it over and over and over again...
(10:35:38)<RotateMe>ugh without noticing the enemy ai has gotten pretty mean
(10:35:54)<RotateMe>they change positions while attacking you, so it's hard to hack down the weakest
(10:36:22)<RotateMe>can't even kill 5 rats anymore even though technically they stayed the same
(10:36:36)<RotateMe>guess that's the difference between realtime and turn based
(10:59:33)<RotateMe>is there a way to determine if the object a pointer points to has been deleted?
(10:59:49)<RotateMe>(and yeah i *can* see the irony to what i said before there ;))
(11:00:44)<joe6pack>yes, you will get some error (segmentation fault?)
(11:03:12)<RotateMe>not always :(
(11:04:12)<joe6pack>then i don't know... i just make sure to free my pointers at the very end and not to use them afterwards 
(11:04:30)<Kadwiell>If you mean for debugging, you could use something like valgrind
(11:05:05)<RotateMe>problem is, npcs store an enemy they currently trace, if he gets killed i don't really know how to clear the pointer that stores the enemy
(11:05:27)<Kadwiell>Ah, I had that problem exactly in my 7DRL :)
(11:05:32)<RotateMe>in other languages i just look if they are pointing to a deleted object, but it seems here, i can't
(11:07:06)<Kadwiell>Huh, I can't remember how I fixed it, actually.. I wonder if I left that as a bug
(11:07:13)<Glowie>Can't you just loop that floor's NPCs and if the killed monster is the tracked one, pointer=NULL;?
(11:07:30)<Glowie>Kadwiell, which 7DRL is yours?
(11:07:36)<Kadwiell>Tribe
(11:07:41)<Glowie>Okie
(11:07:52)<Glowie>My greenskins just died :(
(11:08:04)<Kadwiell>Aw
(11:08:19)<Kadwiell>I didn't have time for game balance I guess :)
(11:08:24)<Glowie>I rallied them to battle, slew a few humies and then painted the blood with my people
(11:08:36)<Glowie>painted the floor*
(11:08:38)<RotateMe>Glowie, yeah, i will do it like that, but just one check would've been easier
(11:08:51)<Glowie>That's C++ for you ^
(11:09:05)<Kadwiell>You realized there's a way to win, carrying the bombs to the first floor and all that?
(11:09:24)<Kadwiell>It takes ages, so the "proper" strategy is probably to order someone to do that in the beginning
(11:09:53)<RotateMe>Tribe was pretty hard, but maybe i didn't get everything
(11:10:00)<Glowie>Yup but I thought I'd need to clear a few floors before doing that :P
(11:10:53)<joe6pack>RotateMe: maybe read about dangling pointers
(11:10:57)<Kadwiell>Ah, right, I fixed that with a horrible hack
(11:11:39)<Kadwiell>Every time before the pointer is used, it goes through the list of pointers to all living actors in the _game_ to see if it's there
(11:11:49)<Kadwiell>If not, it's set to NULL
(11:11:51)<Glowie>:D
(11:11:54)<joe6pack>heh
(11:12:00)<joe6pack>O(a lot)
(11:12:03)<Glowie>Now that deserves the word horrible
(11:14:36)<RotateMe>well atm it's no problem, the opposite is the case: it makes enemy units swarm around the player, because it seems his x and y coordinates are still unchanged in the memory :D
(11:14:56)<RotateMe>*swarm around the player after he's dead
(11:28:24)<the_ru>joe6pack: aren't you in Austria?
(11:29:57)<joe6pack>the_ru: i am
(11:29:59)<joe6pack>why?
(11:31:23)<the_ru>you grew up in israel?
(11:31:41)<joe6pack>yes,
(11:31:48)<joe6pack>i moved here a bit more than 3 years ago
(11:32:11)<the_ru>Ok - that explains your name sounding somewhat non-Austrian, I guess
(11:32:50)<the_ru>Anyway - copy & paste isn't a good solution for anything
(11:32:57)<joe6pack>"ido" could be a nick name in austria i guess
(11:33:05)<the_ru>I have lots of it in my code; it works but it's not very elegant
(11:33:17)<joe6pack>for Guido
(11:33:31)<the_ru>I have generic functions for the big things though, like attributes
(11:33:56)<the_ru>I have like 50 attributes
(11:34:11)<the_ru>so it's basically just a get_attribute(i) where i is the index of the desired attribute
(11:34:28)<the_ru>makes adding/removing attributes a breeze
(11:40:33)<RotateMe>anyone played "Fate" in here?
(11:40:38)<RotateMe>http://de.youtube.com/watch?v=miLGnw8TBEI&feature=related
(11:40:47)<the_ru>was it like Fudge?ÔøΩ
(11:41:00)<RotateMe>Fudge the pudding? ^^
(11:41:08)<the_ru>Fudge the RPG? :-)
(11:41:12)<RotateMe>i think it looks very entertaining
(11:42:02)<RotateMe>never heard of a game called Fudge, it's more like Diablo/Sacred/Divine/ThroneOfDarkness/Revenant etc.
(11:42:20)<the_ru>Fudge is a pen-and-paper system
(11:42:26)<the_ru>TSL is loosely based on it
(11:43:06)<RotateMe>ah you did TSL?
(11:43:12)<RotateMe>is there any chance of a win port?
(11:43:35)<RotateMe>i always *loved* the name, and especially the screenshot with the tiny font
(11:43:42)<the_ru>it's open source
(11:43:47)<the_ru>so anything could happen, I guess
(11:44:02)<the_ru>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FATE_%28role-playing_game%29
(11:44:36)<the_ru>and the font is the xterm default, it runs in a terminal
(11:46:36)<the_ru>I'm pondering dropping negative attributes completely, though
(11:46:46)<the_ru>they're usually >= 0 anyway
(11:48:12)<the_ru>or create a system that adds and drops attributes as they are needed
(11:53:44)<RotateMe>ah no, i meant this: http://games.wildtangent.com/fate/
(11:54:04)<RotateMe>i always liked games of that kind for some time off
(11:54:24)<RotateMe>my attributes are all unsigned ints
(11:54:26)<RotateMe>hp are not
(11:54:50)<RotateMe>heaving unsigned hp made beings indestructable, i searched a looooong time for that bug ;D

(01:25:02)<Glowie>Molten Core's trailer kicks ass :P
(01:25:13)<RotateMe>just watched it and wanted to say that
(01:25:42)<RotateMe>makes the blizzard team look pretty cool in my eyes
(01:25:57)<RotateMe>funniest part is, "has sound!" ;)

(01:47:27)<TMC>:D
(01:48:20)<TMC>:O
(01:48:58)<RotateMe>post it molten core style and release it as GenRogue
(01:50:17)<Epyon_>Nah, it would be ununderstandable for anyone except for maybe 30-40 people, even if I translated it to english :)
(01:50:27)<Epyon_>The name of it is "14"
(01:50:58)<Epyon_>The game is a very exaggarated and sick view on the Highschool I was attending to.
(01:51:24)<RotateMe>sounds like GenRogue on 1st of apirl ;)
(01:53:23)<Epyon_>The intro screen sais "Copyright 1999, The Fuck-drunk Programmers Group.   The authors do not take any responsibility for their program. Playing may induce permanent brain damage. The program is not suited for people under 18 years of age... actually it's not suited for anyone."

(01:54:28)<RotateMe>sounds nice ;)
(01:54:38)<Epyon_>The player is an underage student of the school. You get points for drinking, smoking, beating people up, the more sick the situation the more points.
(01:55:33)<Epyon_>All realised in a single player MUD environment
(01:55:59)<Epyon_>The location descriptions are sick D:
(01:56:38)<Epyon_>Not to mention the NPCs and items O.O
(01:58:38)<Glowie>Did you drink, smoke and beat people up when you were in highschool?
(01:58:45)<Epyon_>Kinda :>
(01:58:49)<Glowie>:<
(01:58:58)<Epyon_>The last one rarely though.
(01:59:09)<Glowie>And then made a game of it >_>
(01:59:22)<Epyon_>Yep :P
(01:59:40)<Epyon_>Columbine Massacre RPG would be rated Teen compared to this one ^_^
(02:00:05)<Glowie>At least it's not using drugs, raping and killing :<
(02:00:24)<Epyon_>Nah, that didn't happen...
(02:00:30)<Epyon_>... very often ...
(02:01:25)<Epyon_>Oh, cool, another old game that never was released :D
(02:01:41)<Epyon_>Knajpa -- (Lousy Bar in polish)
(02:02:01)<Glowie>More of the drinking theme?
(02:02:09)<Epyon_>Wrech as much havoc without getting beat up, passing out, or getting arrested ^_^
(02:02:33)<Glowie>Sounds like that
(02:03:02)<Epyon_>Oh my, NightCity, that's a classic :D
(02:03:19)<Epyon_>Too bad that I can't run it due to the Runtime 200 error :(
(02:03:26)<TMC>suuuure
(02:03:34)<Epyon_>TMC?
(02:03:51)<TMC>Epyon?
(02:03:59)<Epyon_>What is it?
(02:04:06)<TMC>it's a me
(02:04:46)<Epyon_>Oh my, "unit BloodGFX;" :D
(02:05:21)<Epyon_>Part of the NightCity code
(02:05:40)<Epyon_>One of these days I'm gonna ressurect NightCity as part of the 7DRL compo.
(02:06:03)<Epyon_>Aaah, and here start the GenRogue's :D
(02:06:23)<Epyon_>Oh my, this version is still called GenRoUGe :P
(02:06:48)<Epyon_>Took about 4 rewrites until I noticed ^_^

(02:09:31)<Epyon_>"World of Shadows: Blood Chronicles" aka GenRogue attempt #3
(02:12:42)<RotateMe>;) a friend faked a 10 minute installing process, with three bars and lots of text everywhere
(02:12:53)<RotateMe>it made the game look friggin awesome ^^
(02:13:43)<Epyon_>The next to last version of GR actually generated the world about 15 minutes D:
(02:14:18)<Epyon_>Still doesn't beat Dwarf Fortress though -- for the next incarnation I need to make sure it generates at least 5 hours ^_^
(02:16:13)<TMC>heehehhh
(02:17:24)<Epyon_>World of Shadows : Bloodlines a.k.a. GenRogue #5
(02:19:01)<RotateMe>be glad if you have it, i lost most of the games from my old pcs :(
(02:19:26)<Epyon_>I keep all revelant data on a few HD's :)
(02:19:27)<RotateMe>it was a 386 so i had to put the stuff on floppys, which tend to be broken if you use them a few weeks later
(02:21:29)<Epyon_>Okay, now moving into a more recent folder.
(02:21:31)<RotateMe>the biggest loss i have was a gauntlet like game written in qbasic...
(02:23:25)<Epyon_>List of subfolders : WOS, WOSPK, GENMUD, GENMUD2, GENROGUE, GENR2, GMFREE, GRFREE, GVFREE, GVNEW, GVEXEC, INFINITY, JEDIMUD, DOWNFALL
(02:23:36)<Epyon_>Guess what they stand for :)
(02:24:04)<Epyon_>Now the most historically important one here i DOWNFALL -- guess why :)
(02:25:23)<TMC>hmm.. GV?
(02:25:31)<TMC>Executive Edition :P
(02:26:14)<RotateMe>http://www.explosm.net/comics/1225/
(02:26:36)<Epyon_>GV stands for GenRogue Valkyrie
(02:27:29)<Epyon_>The most important one however from a historical point of view is DOWNFALL -- it's code was used as the base for DoomRL :)
(02:28:19)<Epyon_>Actually most of DoomRL's source files still start with df :P
(02:42:35)<jomiolto>few years back I lost most of my stuff to a hard drive crash, and since then I've made almost daily backups :)
(02:46:30)<DarkGod>I've setup a raid for my computer
(02:48:45)<jomiolto>what if your computer burns down or is struck by lightning? :)
(02:49:00)<jomiolto>(I seem to have become quite paranoid about backups...)
(02:49:42)<Epyon_>DarkGod :D
(02:50:00)<Epyon_>Havn't talked to you lately ^^
(02:50:02)<DarkGod>jomiolto: I do make backup too ;)
(02:50:10)<jomiolto>ok :)
(02:50:18)<DarkGod>Epyon_: hello :)
(02:50:26)<Epyon_>I use a synchronised SVN between my server and chaosforge one
(02:50:32)<DarkGod>jomiolto: but there could be a world wide nuclear war
(02:50:51)<jomiolto>DarkGod: oh no :( I must send backups to space too!
(02:50:56)<DarkGod>jomiolto: that's why I duplicate the quantum state of my backups in a paralel universe
(02:51:06)<jomiolto>yeah, that's even better
(02:51:25)<jomiolto>but what if the whole multiverse collapses and ceases to exist?
(02:51:51)<jomiolto>although, I think that not having backups would be the least of troubles if that happened :)
(02:52:12)<DarkGod>jomiolto: then i'll use my timemachine to go back to a point of space/time when the multiverse was not collapsed and save it from doing so
(02:52:17)<jomiolto>hmm, but I must be off to a sexology lecture :)
(02:54:19)<DarkGod>sounds fun
(02:54:50)<TMC>when the universe ceases to exist, you'll *really wish* you had backups!
(02:57:13)<DarkGod>hey Epyon_, seen my latest non RL work ? http://mailcatch.com/
(02:58:19)<Epyon_>heh funny :P
(02:58:53)<Epyon_>Here's a preview of my non-rl work in progress : http://chaosforge.org/sd_halberd.png
(02:59:44)<TMC>ooo, very simple!
(02:59:59)<Epyon_>I'm leaving texturing for when I decide how the engine will use them
(03:00:23)<Epyon_>From the same project : http://chaosforge.org/latern-promo.png
(03:00:49)<DarkGod>:)
(03:01:33)<Epyon_>And last but not least : http://chaosforge.org/files/tau-prototype2.png
(03:02:07)<Epyon_>This was the last screenshot before I moved to C++ : http://chaosforge.org/files/sd_ss_8.png
(03:03:34)<DarkGod>i'm bad at 3D :)
(03:03:47)<DarkGod>well I could make a 3D engine but not artwork ;)
(03:04:19)<Epyon_>I'm bad at artwork too. I hope I'll catch the eye of some 3d artist that will be willing to do some free work though :>
(03:04:33)<DarkGod>artist ? free work ?
(03:04:53)<Epyon_>Yeah I know :/
(03:05:14)<Epyon_>Oh, fun : http://chaosforge.org/files/sdtm.png
(03:06:18)<Epyon_>Until I find one, people will have to putup with my wannabe models.
(03:07:58)<DarkGod>:)
(03:13:03)<Epyon_>OMFG, GenRogue todo lists O.o
(03:14:54)<DarkGod>telnet omniscientist.org

(03:16:46)<DaEezT>Be happy
(03:17:11)<DarkGod>why?
(03:17:42)<Epyon_>Oh my, I found a GenRogue version new enough to actually run without the Runtime 200 error O.o
(03:18:08)<Epyon_>I dig the intro screen ^_^
(03:35:00)<the_ru>My GFs sister is pregnant
(03:35:05)<the_ru>OTOH, it's April 1st
(03:35:13)<the_ru>But she says it's for real
(03:35:18)<the_ru>My condoleances
(03:35:32)<the_ru>So anyway, back in the real world
(03:35:50)<the_ru>I'm having a bad case of featuritis creepuitis :-/
(03:37:36)<the_ru>I'm loosing focus from a action-packed dungeon crawl to a world exploration game
(03:37:59)<the_ru>I have ideas for ~10 overworld areas
(03:38:15)<the_ru>That isn't so bad in itself, as most would be optional
(03:38:36)<the_ru>But then there is the problem with the portals connecting them
(03:39:04)<the_ru>In every world but the one you start in, the portal will be above ground
(03:39:18)<the_ru>In the first, though, I'd like to have it at the bottom of the dungeon
(03:39:55)<the_ru>So how would anyone motivate putting such a thing in a location that's hard to reach and prone to cave-ins?
(03:40:12)<the_ru>If it's for travel and trade, it ought to be as easy to access as possible
(03:40:22)<the_ru>So; I could create an overworld for the first world as well
(03:40:39)<the_ru>But it feels like I'm loosing my grip
(03:42:22)<the_ru>What would I put there?
(03:42:49)<the_ru>A deserted village, a dark cathedral with a huge dungeon?
(03:42:55)<the_ru>Tristram here we come!
(03:46:54)<TMC>:O
(03:50:48)<the_ru>So how would I merge all my diverse worlds into a single tree without producing the same kind of theme-mismatch found in any major roguelike?
(03:51:00)<the_ru>I doubt it's possible
(04:12:00)<TMC>Eypon, your screenshots fill me with resolve to kill my space based game
(04:12:33)<TMC>both engine and 3D models were vastly inferior
(04:12:47)<TMC>also, I really like your models!
(04:13:23)<TMC>maybe they'll look worse textured than with the diffuse whiteness
(04:14:58)<TMC>DIED
(04:16:44)<Epyon_>TMC, thanks :)
(04:26:05)<TMC>...logging party?
(04:28:33)<TMC>oh damnit!
(04:28:37)<TMC>way too late!
(04:28:38)<TMC>bye!
(04:56:44)<RotateMe>god dammit i shouldn't have installed fate
(04:56:52)<RotateMe>keeps me from working on my game :(
(04:57:00)<RotateMe>great diablo clone for the holidays
(04:58:35)<deveah>has there ever been a reversed rogue?
(04:58:51)<deveah>like a rat/zombie/gnome hunting the player?
(04:59:27)<deveah>or a wall moving in a world of player-like-walls?
(05:00:07)<RotateMe>i'm pretty sure the first one has been made, or at least begun
(05:00:16)<RotateMe>tribe and kobold's quest come to my mind
(05:00:57)<RotateMe>and the wall moving thing doesn't sound fun ^^
(06:03:27)<RotateMe>how do i declare functions with default parameters?
(06:03:57)<Epyon_>in C++?
(06:04:19)<Epyon_>int myfunc(int x = 12, int y = 23) {}
(06:06:17)<RotateMe>yes c++
(06:06:29)<RotateMe>no i mean when i declare them seperated in a header file
(06:06:36)<RotateMe>like int myfunc(int,int);
(06:07:07)<Epyon_>int myfunc(int x = 12, int y = 23); :P
(06:07:08)<RotateMe>implementation: int myfunc( int a, int b = 999) {}
(06:07:23)<RotateMe>ah so i can't leave variable names away in this case :(
(06:09:00)<RotateMe>well, works now, thanks!
(06:17:42)<deveah>sweet! a RL with complete functions = 31.8 kb!
(08:27:41)<the_ru>complete functions?
(08:28:00)<the_ru>Oh
(08:28:02)<the_ru>He left?
(08:29:30)<the_ru>Heh
(08:29:38)<the_ru>My bandmate is a strange guy
(08:29:42)<the_ru>He plays bass
(08:29:51)<joe6pack>that *is* strange
(08:30:03)<the_ru>Had barely played for 10 years before he joined us
(08:30:18)<joe6pack>isn't 10 years a lot?
(08:30:44)<the_ru>He's really careful, alwaysturns down his volume and plucks the strings very softly as if he was afraid to play something wrong
(08:31:05)<the_ru>then he suddenly breaks out into an improvised kickass solo just out of nowhere
(08:31:07)<the_ru>WTH
(08:31:18)<the_ru>10 years
(08:31:24)<the_ru>well, 10 years are 10 years
(08:31:34)<the_ru>if it's a lot of not depends on what you make of them, I guess?
(08:32:13)<the_ru>IMO; if you watch TV, it's a lot. If you practice an instrument, or write a roguelike, it's barely the beginning!
(08:54:38)<the_ru>I'm having problems with random crashes :-/
(09:16:04)<the_ru>I don't get what's going on
(09:16:11)<the_ru>it gets a pointer from an array
(09:16:19)<the_ru>where it's apparently non-null
(09:16:33)<the_ru>yet suddenly, it's null
(09:16:48)<joe6pack>run it through a debugger 
(09:16:53)<the_ru>I am
(09:16:58)<the_ru>just don't know what to look for
(09:17:03)<joe6pack>hmmm
(09:17:11)<joe6pack>too bad :(
(09:17:29)<the_ru>no wait
(09:17:36)<the_ru>it gets a non-null pointer
(09:18:45)<the_ru>which it proceeds to operate on
(09:18:57)<the_ru>but at one point, the pointer is invalid
(09:19:33)<the_ru>*something* deallocates and removes it from the array, but the calling function isn't aware of that...
(09:41:45)<the_ru>What the hell
(09:41:52)<the_ru>I do
(09:41:56)<the_ru>fprintf(stderr, "%s\ti: %d\t%p\t%p\n", creature->name, i, creature, creature->turn_func);
(09:42:02)<the_ru>and it prints
(09:42:07)<the_ru>rat     i: 5    0xb7bb6008      0x807715f
(09:42:16)<the_ru>but then, on the lines...
(09:42:21)<the_ru>if (creature->turn_func != NULL)
(09:42:25)<the_ru>  creature->move_counter -= creature->turn_func(creature);
(09:42:30)<the_ru>I get
(09:42:35)<the_ru>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

(09:46:35)<the_ru>huh
(09:48:02)<jomiolto>h√∂m, mitenk√§s muuten meni ihmisill√§ ohin uusintatentti? siell√§ kun oli jopa yll√§tt√§v√§n paljon porukkaa...
(09:48:07)<jomiolto>oops :/
(09:48:11)<jomiolto>wrong channel, sorry
(10:02:15)<the_ru>...
(10:02:19)<the_ru>I think I caught it
(10:02:38)<the_ru>there seem to be cases where turn_func can kill the creature
(10:02:48)<the_ru>for example, if it steps on a lethal trap
(10:03:15)<the_ru>I currently don't have any way to pass back to the caller that such a thing happened
(10:03:54)<the_ru>so I have to check the levels creature[] array and see if the creature is still in there - i.e. it's still alive
(10:04:00)<the_ru>and the pointer is valid
(10:04:01)<the_ru>:-(
(10:04:56)<the_ru>... and about now you're probably all wondering what the hell I'm talking about
(10:04:58)<the_ru>I'm not sure myself
(10:06:13)<the_ru>perhaps I should just add a "dead" flag in the creature_t struct, that I flip
(10:06:26)<the_ru>and then let the main game loop free the memory
(10:07:00)<the_ru>but that would require if (creature->dead) checks in many places
(10:07:02)<the_ru>I imagine
(10:07:04)<the_ru>How do you do it?
(10:08:03)<the_ru>... and I'm not really expecting any interpreted/GC-equipped language geeks to answer that
(10:08:20)<jomiolto>hmm, I had a similar problem, but I don't remember how I solved it
(10:10:04)<jomiolto>I think I somehow made it so that monsters are only killed in one place in the code, and that code removed all the references to the monster from everywhere
(10:10:26)<the_ru>yeah, I think that makes sense
(10:10:44)<the_ru>I'm sure I had some reason NOT to do it that way, but I can't remember what it was :-/
(10:11:24)<jomiolto>it actually gets really ugly when you have a lot of references to the monsters/other things all around the place
(10:12:48)<jomiolto>for example I had items that could have a monster as their owner, and then AI code also needed references whenever a monster attacked another monster, etc.
(10:13:12)<the_ru>yeah
(10:13:18)<the_ru>I have master->minion relationships
(10:13:57)<the_ru>I keep them in a global 2D array, where each row is a relationship, index 0 is the master and index 1 is the minion
(10:14:12)<the_ru>since the master and minion might end up on different levels
(10:14:40)<the_ru>and I don't want to search EVERY creature on EVERY level for a reference if I remove either of them
(10:15:01)<the_ru>it's better to have them in a list, and have get_master() etc functions
(10:15:46)<the_ru>but anyway, in many places I'm using the return value of functions to tell the caller if the creature pointer is still valid
(10:16:21)<the_ru>but it feels like there are better uses for the return values
(10:16:57)<the_ru>and in some places I simply need them for other things, that's why I had to do it this way with the traps
(10:17:10)<jomiolto>I've considered putting all the monsters/items/etc. in lists from which they can be referenced with an integer index, instead of a pointer
(10:17:25)<the_ru>yeah, been thinking of that too
(10:17:37)<the_ru>it ought to make saving/loading easier as well
(10:17:44)<the_ru>although I'm not adding that to my game
(10:17:45)<jomiolto>that way there will not be problems with pointers, but there is a performance penalty, unless there is some smart ninja way to do it
(10:18:14)<the_ru>what language are you using?
(10:18:17)<jomiolto>C
(10:18:29)<the_ru>I wouldn't worry about the performance then
(10:18:39)<jomiolto>I can't really help it :)
(10:18:43)<jomiolto>I'm so used to it
(10:18:57)<the_ru>I can guarantee there are better places to hunt cycles :-)
(10:19:35)<jomiolto>I used to do a lot of coding when I only had a 66MHz 486 machine, and that really required some optimizing even for some relatively simple things
(10:19:38)<the_ru>BTW, an example: my activate_trap() function only takes a trap_t pointer as argument, and figures out on its own which creature is standing on it
(10:20:19)<the_ru>a trap could also kill multiple creatures, so either way it would be very inconvenient to try to track them
(10:20:31)<jomiolto>yeah
(10:21:34)<the_ru>My creatures take almost 54k memory :-O
(10:21:38)<the_ru>... each
(10:21:45)<jomiolto>what? how did you manage that? :D
(10:23:31)<the_ru>well, 13k are just for LOS tables and such things
(10:23:51)<jomiolto>oh, you do LOS for all the monsters?
(10:24:05)<the_ru>yes
(10:24:21)<the_ru>and I regenerate everything every turn, and keep it in a table :-/
(10:24:32)<the_ru>instead of just calculating the lines I need when I need them
(10:25:16)<jomiolto>I simply check if there is something interesting in the radius of the monster's vision, and then check if there is a line-of-sight from those interesting things to the monster
(10:26:09)<the_ru>unlike 99% of the RL developers out there, I don't think it's very interesting to create the ultimate LOS
(10:26:25)<jomiolto>"ultimate LOS"?
(10:26:31)<jomiolto>something like a really cool los algo?
(10:26:36)<the_ru>I just use a brute force approach, calculate everything with 360 degree precision just in case, and proceed to write actual game content
(10:26:42)<the_ru>yes
(10:26:58)<jomiolto>do you use raycasting or something else?
(10:27:14)<the_ru>it seems like there's always a thread in the newsgroups about the most efficient LOS implementation
(10:27:18)<the_ru>I have no idea
(10:27:31)<jomiolto>heh, I'm actually developing a new LOS algorithm :)
(10:27:33)<the_ru>I "cast" "rays" in a way, but I dunno if it's actually raycasting
(10:27:57)<jomiolto>I currently use raycasting, but it's an O(n^3) implementation of it, because I want it to look nice
(10:28:10)<jomiolto>and it gets too slow at longer radii
(10:28:14)<the_ru>starting at each creature, I use sin and cos to shoot rays into all directions
(10:28:44)<the_ru>it's "fast enough" that no one has ever complained, and I honestly don't notice it being slow
(10:29:23)<jomiolto>of course, if you only use small radii with LOS, it is not going to matter that much, but I want it to be usable at something like radius=25 or longer
(10:29:49)<the_ru>I use 40, don't notice any slowness
(10:29:52)<jomiolto>:/
(10:30:02)<jomiolto>then your LOS must be much more efficient than my current one
(10:30:09)<the_ru>I don't have the patience to keep reinventing the wheel, it feels like I'm falling behind in the race :-/
(10:30:18)<jomiolto>yeah, that is true
(10:30:27)<jomiolto>sometimes it really sucks to be a perfectionist :(
(10:30:30)<the_ru>the race against time, since I know some day I won't be able or won't want to work on this anymore
(10:30:39)<the_ru>I want to finish
(10:31:01)<the_ru>I don't think it's very efficient, I just don't care
(10:31:05)<jomiolto>and I don't even think that it matters so much in the end, because most of the players are not going to notice anything ,unless the LOS is really *ugly*
(10:31:53)<the_ru>if it's a fun game, I think people will accept it
(10:32:02)<the_ru>... or fix it for you, if it's open source ;-)
(10:32:23)<jomiolto>but I think now I'm going to stick with this LOS that I'm developing, since it looks as good as the old one (or even better) and is a lot faster
(10:32:44)<the_ru>do you have level validation?
(10:32:51)<jomiolto>what's that?
(10:33:20)<the_ru>I check mine for stuff like connectivity (all tiles must be reachable), that stairs are built where they are supposed to, etc
(10:33:32)<the_ru>the connectivity is probably the most inefficient routine I have, but it works
(10:33:45)<jomiolto>well, yeah, it is kind of built into the dungeon generation. All the dungeons generated will be sane
(10:34:00)<the_ru>I count the number of traversable tiles, then floodfill them and see if the numbers match
(10:34:14)<jomiolto>when it comes to LOS, I would like to implement something like this: http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Digital_field_of_view_implementation
(10:34:16)<the_ru>if there are more traversable tiles than floodfilled ones, there ought to be a cut-off section somewhere
(10:34:23)<jomiolto>but it's way too complex for me to understand :/
(10:34:53)<jomiolto>I actually use quite a many different dungeon generators for my main roguelike
(10:35:33)<jomiolto>there are wilderness levels, caves, mines, troll caves, etc.
(10:35:36)<the_ru>I have two so far
(10:35:40)<the_ru>and variants of those
(10:35:58)<jomiolto>the wilderness one was actually really fun to code and I really like it :)
(10:36:03)<the_ru>one generates 90% valid maps, but I want a bit of randomness
(10:36:19)<jomiolto>it generates forests, swamps, hills, mountains and river/lake levels
(10:36:19)<the_ru>could be 100%, but then they'd be too predictable
(10:36:24)<the_ru>a-ha
(10:36:34)<the_ru>is it a continuous world, or discrete areas?
(10:37:09)<jomiolto>well, I have an overworld like in ADOM and you can "enter" wilderness squares, which basically just generates a random level according to your surroudings
(10:37:34)<the_ru>I'm considering overworld maps now, but I'm reluctant to add them. They became the killing blow for my previous roguelike
(10:37:35)<jomiolto>so if there are swamps near you, there will be swamps in the wilderness levels
(10:37:43)<the_ru>ok
(10:37:48)<jomiolto>and same for hills, forests, etc.
(10:39:12)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/files/roguelike/screenshots/mine/screenshot23.png
(10:39:15)<the_ru>I had something like that
(10:40:00)<the_ru>you could "zoom" to a local view, and it would generate an area map
(10:40:35)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/files/roguelike/screenshots/mine/screenshot24.png
(10:40:45)<the_ru>don't have any shots of the local view though :-/
(10:41:10)<the_ru>the first one is a small island, the other is a continent (?)
(10:41:46)<jomiolto>I'm just making some screenshots of my overworld/wilderness levels :)
(10:42:08)<the_ru>I'm pondering adding overworld areas to TSL
(10:42:16)<the_ru>but it feels like it goes against the spirit of the game
(10:42:51)<the_ru>I wanted it to be a quick dungeon crawl, now I'm *again* turning it into the bloated thing I wanted to get away from when I started my rewrite
(10:43:31)<jomiolto>heh, that's why I'm doing two roguelikes: one is a simple dungeon crawl, and another one is a larger and more complex one
(10:44:28)<the_ru>I wish there was a way to combine them
(10:44:47)<the_ru>my plan is to have a system of portals connecting different (deserted) worlds
(10:45:06)<the_ru>but I want the first portal to be at the bottom of the first dungeon
(10:45:15)<the_ru>while the others should be above ground
(10:45:32)<the_ru>but then: how would anyone motivate placing a portal intended for travel and trade below ground?
(10:46:04)<the_ru>so I could add a small village above the dungeon where the portal is...
(10:46:14)<the_ru>but then I'd really just be ripping off Diablo
(10:46:38)<the_ru>and I can't come up with any way to combine the different worlds, they're too diverse
(10:47:18)<the_ru>catacombs - flooded city - spaceship - volcano - glacier
(10:47:37)<the_ru>now how would I motivate all *that* being in close proximity with each other?
(10:48:20)<jomiolto>hmm, these levels don't look quite as good as I remembered :/
(10:48:20)<the_ru>catacombs under a flooded city with a volcano underneath and a glacier on top, all within an enormous space ship?
(10:48:43)<jomiolto>that indeed seems like a bit of an overkill...
(10:49:32)<the_ru>I *could* have a main dungeon, with optional world travel
(10:51:19)<the_ru>I don't want the main antagonist to be just some pathetic mad wizard though
(10:51:32)<the_ru>it should be an evil deity of cosmic proportions
(10:51:47)<the_ru>I want the player to travel through the worlds it has already ruined
(10:52:16)<jomiolto>there are a few shots: http://www.hytti.uku.fi/~jmtoivan/exadorshots/
(10:52:26)<jomiolto>all of them are randomly generated, except for the oevrworld map
(10:52:38)<jomiolto>not nearly as pretty as I remembered :/
(10:52:50)<jomiolto>it's been way too long since I've done some real coding on my game
(10:53:07)<joe6pack>looks cool
(10:53:20)<the_ru>yeah
(10:53:23)<the_ru>much better than mine, at least
(10:53:44)<the_ru>I just placed random stuff, with a lesser probability in the middle of the map - to create a traversable path
(10:53:52)<the_ru>you actually generate patches of stuff
(10:54:19)<the_ru>whatever those brown ~ are - pools of blood!?
(10:54:24)<the_ru>hm... maybe hills
(10:54:25)<jomiolto>hills :)
(10:54:43)<jomiolto>the ^s are mountains
(10:54:48)<the_ru>ok
(10:55:07)<the_ru>well, as long as there are things to do in the wilderness :-)
(10:55:11)<jomiolto>one of the things lacking from those shots are plants
(10:55:29)<jomiolto>I'm planning to have an alchemy system in the game, and there will be some vegetation you can collect
(10:55:32)<the_ru>ADOM has a relatively small overworld, but it feels like there's a lot to do in it
(10:55:48)<the_ru>are we developing the same game? :-O
(10:56:01)<jomiolto>the_ru: there already are orc raiding parties, zombie hordes in swamps, and bandit camps in the wilderness
(10:56:23)<jomiolto>currently they are just random monsters, though
(10:56:54)<the_ru>I like this shot, BTW: http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/files/roguelike/screenshots/mine/screenshot11.png
(10:57:07)<jomiolto>:D
(10:57:09)<the_ru>how do you handle random encounters?
(10:57:16)<the_ru>where do you place the character?
(10:57:32)<jomiolto>hmm, I'm not sure actually :D
(10:57:35)<the_ru>I never figured out a good way to do it; I just placed it in the middle
(10:57:50)<the_ru>it didn't work very well if there was e.g. a castle there
(10:58:08)<the_ru>since you were supposed to walk into it yourself :-/
(10:58:22)<jomiolto>I think the character is placed in the middle if there is no encounter, or if you were ambushed (random change), or around the edge if you managed to sneak to the camp/raidin party
(10:58:36)<the_ru>ok
(10:59:07)<the_ru>I had hand-made towns, though
(10:59:15)<jomiolto>I also have several pre-generated maps, and in those the character is placed in some set position
(10:59:23)<the_ru>ok
(10:59:54)<the_ru>I had problems with that in a location where it mattered where the player came from
(11:00:13)<the_ru>it was a mountain range, where a fort was the only way to get through
(11:00:22)<jomiolto>hmm, in that overworld map I can count 6 dungeons, 5 forts, 4 towns/cities, couple of small settlements and several misc. places
(11:00:35)<jomiolto>and I have a lot of content planned for each of them, yikes
(11:00:49)<the_ru>the idea was that you would have to go through it by foot, so if for example you're wanted for some crime you'd have to avoid the guards
(11:00:54)<the_ru>... but I never got that far
(11:01:26)<the_ru>a word of advice from one that tried that and failed: take small steps :-)
(11:01:33)<jomiolto>yeah, I know :)
(11:01:49)<jomiolto>oh, and that map isn't showing the hidden locations; there are at least two of them :)
(11:02:07)<the_ru>I worked for *a year* on the last version of HASAD, it got too massive for me to ever want to touch it again
(11:02:15)<jomiolto>:(
(11:02:53)<jomiolto>I'm actually really eager to get to content adding part, but I'm currently doing some major refactoring/rewriting and there's still a lot to do before I can actually continue with the development
(11:03:02)<the_ru>so I wonder why the hell I'm getting myself into building that kind of game again
(11:03:12)<jomiolto>have you done any smaller roguelikes?
(11:03:21)<jomiolto>like 7drl or something like that?
(11:03:38)<the_ru>yeah, try to get the code as good as possible - it's a lot more fun to add content then
(11:03:44)<the_ru>this is my "small" RL
(11:03:48)<jomiolto>oh :)
(11:03:57)<the_ru>at 34k lines
(11:04:01)<jomiolto>:/
(11:04:18)<jomiolto>I have something like 38k lines, and a lot of that is crap :/
(11:04:19)<the_ru>it's more than HASAD was when I quit it, but it's capable of much more as well
(11:05:14)<the_ru>I'll try not to get carried away by my dynamic map sizes... just because my engine can handle them I don't have to use them for everything
(11:05:23)<jomiolto>39655 lines in the most recent version
(11:05:39)<the_ru>is it public?
(11:05:50)<jomiolto>although, the last year or so of the development I've somehow managed to increase the code base, but not add any real features :(
(11:05:53)<jomiolto>no, not yet
(11:06:19)<jomiolto>that's actually the reason I'm doing refactoring, the code is just too bloated and ugly to work on
(11:06:29)<the_ru>indeed
(11:06:42)<the_ru>I'm always trying to shave off a few lines here and there
(11:07:06)<the_ru>but the line count is somewhat misleading, since a lot of that is comments
(11:07:07)<jomiolto>I never did that before Istarted the current refactoring process, I just added and added code
(11:07:13)<the_ru>and I have a very verbose comment style
(11:07:19)<the_ru>:-)
(11:07:38)<jomiolto>some parts of the code are actually quite horrible
(11:08:10)<jomiolto>for example some of the display code; I originally made the game only for Curses, but then I decided to hack together a quick SDL module for it, and that code is all over the place :(
(11:08:20)<the_ru>the lesson I learned from HASAD was to draw a line and stick to it
(11:08:35)<the_ru>(a lesson I'm not adhering to very well ATM)
(11:08:42)<jomiolto>heh :)
(11:08:48)<the_ru>gotta set up priorities
(11:08:56)<jomiolto>there's no such thing as learning from mistakes, it's all just an illusion :)
(11:09:09)<the_ru>there has to be
(11:09:18)<jomiolto>that was mostly just a joke :)
(11:09:20)<the_ru>otherwise I wouldn't have gotten this far on the second try
(11:09:23)<the_ru>:-)
(11:09:55)<the_ru>hm
(11:09:57)<the_ru>I've gotta go
(11:10:00)<jomiolto>ok
(11:10:02)<jomiolto>bye
(11:10:02)<the_ru>Gotta go for a walk
(11:10:06)<the_ru>before it gets to late
(11:10:08)<the_ru>l8r
(11:34:58)<the_ru>I think I have a clue now
(11:35:10)<the_ru>It's like Tolkien when the dwarves awaken the Balrog
(11:35:17)<the_ru>It's also like Stargate
(11:35:41)<the_ru>They dig too deep, and find an ancient portal
(11:36:01)<the_ru>activating the portal brings the attention of the Big Bad Deity that's already out there, destroying worlds
(11:36:17)<the_ru>within days, your world is overrun
(11:40:16)<the_ru>so once you battle or sneak through the enemy lines, the portal will let you travel to other worlds that have already been conquered
(11:40:38)<the_ru>where you must gather items that act as keys, to unlock the way to the final bad guy
(11:40:43)<the_ru>kind of crawlish
(11:56:53)<jomiolto>"The Garbage Collector will ultimately claim all Java coders, but C coders can live on forever in the leaked memory." :)
(11:57:45)<the_ru>until a reboot anyway
(11:58:00)<jomiolto>yeah, until the universe reboots :)
(11:58:19)<jomiolto>the_ru: just out of curiosity: have you read the Death Gate Cycle series?
(11:58:28)<the_ru>Feist?
(11:58:30)<the_ru>No...
(11:58:31)<jomiolto>because your game keeps constantly reminding me of it
(11:58:45)<jomiolto>no, I think it's from Weis and Hickman
(11:58:49)<the_ru>Hm
(11:58:54)<the_ru>Yes, I think you're correct
(11:58:57)<the_ru>Well, never read it
(11:59:07)<the_ru>read a lot of Dragonlance though
+++ The date has changed: 2008/04/02 +++
(12:00:13)<jomiolto>hmm, I think I've read some of that too
(12:00:23)<jomiolto>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dragonlance_novels :-O
(12:00:27)<jomiolto>quite a list of books
(12:01:45)<the_ru>Well, from that list, I haven't exactly read *a lot*
(12:02:05)<jomiolto>ah, yes, I've read The War of Souls series
(12:02:14)<the_ru>but it's a lot from my own point of view; it's more than I've really enjoyed reading
(12:02:17)<jomiolto>that was some years ago though, and I can't remember much about it
(12:02:22)<the_ru>M-hm - read that this summer
(12:02:50)<jomiolto>I think there's also another series in there I've read, but can't remember which one
(12:02:58)<the_ru>Loved the dark atmosphere in the first book, but the 2nd and 3rd weren't very good
(12:03:14)<the_ru>all the tension was lost once it was revealed that it was Thakisis that was behind it all
(12:03:35)<the_ru>(although that was really quite obvious even from the start)
(12:03:49)<jomiolto>I
(12:03:53)<jomiolto>ops :)
(12:04:08)<the_ru>have you read anything by David Gemmell?
(12:04:14)<jomiolto>I meant to say that I can't quite remember what I thought of that series
(12:04:20)<the_ru>the Drenai books are the best fantasy I've ever read
(12:04:23)<jomiolto>no, I don't think I have
(12:04:39)<jomiolto>I really liked some of R.A. Salvatore's work
(12:04:47)<jomiolto>like the Dark Elf Trilogy
(12:05:21)<the_ru>is that AD&D?
(12:05:50)<jomiolto>uhm, yeah, I think it is. It's from Forgotten Realms
(12:06:06)<the_ru>I find most RPG-based fiction quite boring :-/
(12:06:22)<the_ru>Except a swedish book, Sv√§rdsspel i Hadarlon, based on the swedish Eon RPG
(12:06:32)<the_ru>that was entertaining
(12:06:46)<jomiolto>I actually haven't read much fantasy for a long time
(12:06:50)<jomiolto>haven't had time/interest
(12:06:51)<the_ru>me neither
(12:07:15)<the_ru>I've had the complete chronicles of Conan lying around since summer
(12:07:25)<the_ru>but don't have any energy to start reading
(12:07:30)<the_ru>and a lot of Lovecraft
(12:07:35)<jomiolto>there was some Katharine Kerr series that I really loved, but sadly couldn't get all of the books in the series in my hands :/
(12:07:40)<the_ru>... it's about time I read the classics
(12:07:57)<the_ru>I'm trying to get through HHGTTG now
(12:08:17)<jomiolto>HHGTTG?
(12:08:37)<the_ru>Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy
(12:08:41)<jomiolto>ah, okay :)
(12:09:06)<jomiolto>I've also read that a long time ago, though it was a finnish translation and I think it had lost a lot of its humour in the translation
(12:09:14)<jomiolto>I'd really like to get the original in my hands
(12:09:19)<the_ru>I have a 5-in-1 edition, so the book is really massive :-/
(12:09:28)<jomiolto>heh
(12:09:48)<jomiolto>my most recent reading has been some Zen philosophy :)
(12:09:51)<the_ru>I'm reading the swedish, but most of it seems to get through
(12:10:03)<the_ru>perhaps Swedish is a more humorous language
(12:10:14)<jomiolto>or perhaps its just closer to English
(12:10:20)<the_ru>he reminds me a lot of pratchett anyway
(12:10:23)<jomiolto>Finnish is quite far from... anything, actually
(12:10:39)<the_ru>It's related to some indian languages, AFAIK :-)
(12:11:51)<the_ru>Pratchett, BTW, I have a hard time "getting"... some of it is just hilarious, while some just gives a "huh" feeling
(12:12:13)<jomiolto>yeah, I've had the same feeling
(12:12:22)<jomiolto>actually quite a lot of "huh" feelings for me
(12:14:08)<the_ru>Reaper Man was great
(12:14:26)<the_ru>Maskerade was ok
(12:14:53)<the_ru>Pyramids great
(12:15:03)<jomiolto>was Reaper Man the one where Death took a little kid as an apprentice, or something like that?
(12:15:22)<the_ru>Eric was "huh" - but that's probably because I didn't "get" the parody it's supposed to be
(12:15:28)<the_ru>no, that's Mort
(12:15:43)<jomiolto>oh, right
(12:16:09)<the_ru>Mort - I'm sure I've read it, but I don't remember *anything* of it
(12:16:12)<jomiolto>I've read Guards! Guards! for example, I felt like i didn't get most of that book
(12:16:17)<the_ru>so that's a "huh" as well, I guess
(12:16:31)<jomiolto>I've also read Mort, but can't remember much of it either, except that I considered the concept to be hilarious :)
(12:17:00)<the_ru>Jingo was a "huh"
(12:17:25)<jomiolto>btw, I've planned on writing a short fantasy series myself, and I actually have a lot of plans for it (the plot in general, the main characters, etc.), but I never seem to have the time for it
(12:18:03)<the_ru>so many ideas, so little time
(12:18:07)<jomiolto>yeah :)
(12:18:35)<the_ru>I had a friend that was really into Discworld but I could never understand his obsession :-/
(12:18:35)<jomiolto>while others wish that there was 28 hours in a day, I wish there was something like 240 :)
(12:19:07)<jomiolto>not that it would help that much because I'm a master in procrastination and in getting nothing done :/
(12:19:26)<the_ru>You could idle for 239 hours, then work your ass off
(12:19:31)<jomiolto>I've also seen a few discworld fans, but no one really obsessed
(12:20:11)<the_ru>He wasn't very happy when I was 50 pages ahead of him in Reaper Man and spoiled all the good quotes :-)
(12:20:18)<jomiolto>perhaps if I spent less time on IRC, I would actually get something done :)
(12:20:29)<the_ru>I've tried that, it works
(12:20:38)<jomiolto>and I could also spent less time drinking :/
(12:20:45)<the_ru>I'm not "really" here now either, just taking a break from real life
(12:21:12)<jomiolto>I'm taking a break from taking a break
(12:21:42)<jomiolto>I was supposed to write email to one of my teachers, but I got distracted and soon I got distracted from the distraction and ended up in IRC
(12:22:16)<jomiolto>kind of reminds me of this: http://xkcd.com/214/
(12:22:38)<the_ru>yeah
(12:24:41)<the_ru>Bah
(12:24:54)<the_ru>Maddox doesn't have any April 1st special
(12:25:03)<the_ru>I'm heading to bed, l8r
(12:25:10)<jomiolto>bye
(10:31:02)<deveah>so, guys, what do you think about nokia 5310?
(10:31:36)<joe6pack>that is is a cell phone
(10:31:47)<DarkGod>it is probably able to make wireless calls
(10:32:58)<joe6pack>deveah: aren't you supposed to be at school right now?
(10:36:36)<deveah>no, it's the Bucharest NATO Summit these days so Bucharest is literally a rock
(10:36:47)<joe6pack>huh
(10:36:54)<deveah>I'm going to see 10000 BC today too!
(10:36:58)<joe6pack>well at least you get a couple of days off
(10:37:01)<joe6pack>i heard it sucks
(10:37:10)<deveah>yes, it does
(10:37:16)<deveah>i can't go into the mountains
(10:38:01)<joe6pack>no i mean the film sucks
(10:38:36)<deveah>well it's an opportunity to get out of the house
(10:38:43)<deveah>so I'm not missing it
(10:38:59)<deveah>and today is wednesday, two tickets at the price of one!
(10:40:19)<deveah>is it something wrong that I use mobile phones for everything except talking?
(10:41:10)<deveah>i'm gonna download some mobile phone demos right away!

(11:09:08)<joe6pack>\o/
(11:19:09)<RotateMe>voted for octobre :P ^^
(11:19:38)<RotateMe>september is the start of my math study
(11:20:10)<RotateMe>but i'd be fine with both, berlin is perfect, i will be living there by that time *THUMBS UP*
(11:21:41)<joe6pack>yea it should be easy/cheap to get there from most of europe 
(11:25:51)<RotateMe>depending on how i will live there, i can of course invite you to my home
(11:27:59)<joe6pack>\o/
(11:28:45)<joe6pack>the real question is what will we do
(11:29:02)<joe6pack>i had an idea for a presentation i can give,
(11:29:13)<joe6pack>about underused ideas in RLs
(11:29:59)<joe6pack>introduce 4-5 games that have at least 1 concept that isn't used often in RLs
(11:30:59)<joe6pack>like the jumping/wall-climbing in the game where you play a thief 
(11:31:23)<Kadwiell>Hey, that was mine!
(11:31:28)<Kadwiell>But it was horrible :/
(11:31:45)<Kadwiell>I think the feature wasn't a bad idea, though
(11:31:46)<joe6pack>it had nice ideas :)
(11:32:05)<joe6pack>it had more than 1 novel idea in it
(11:32:17)<RotateMe>sounds good... everybody could try to come up with some stuff that he didn't show online before
(11:32:36)<joe6pack>well i didn't do a lot of stuff, and it is all online...
(11:32:44)<RotateMe>but mainly it's just a good opportunity for an international meeting
(11:32:56)<joe6pack>an exchange of ideas
(11:33:31)<joe6pack>maybe we could also do a hackathon and try to produce a game together?
(11:33:43)<joe6pack>like in 1-2 days
(11:33:49)<RotateMe>:D that would rule
(11:34:13)<RotateMe>would be kind of unique too i guess
(11:34:14)<Kadwiell>That'd be cool, but probably stressful for the participants :)
(11:34:38)<Kadwiell>There's some saying about how adding people to a late project makes it later, and a 2DRL is already late..
(11:34:49)<joe6pack>yea, well we don't have to have an impressive result 
(11:34:50)<RotateMe>heh
(11:35:21)<RotateMe>if you do it right, you could really get some work done
(11:35:27)<joe6pack>we could just do pair programming, or have 1 person work for a few hours and then another
(11:35:54)<RotateMe>eg. defining a data format, after that someone makes content, someone does the reading of data, someone the engine and someone gets drunk
(11:36:39)<joe6pack>i call the "get drunk" spot 
(11:36:45)<RotateMe>me too
(11:37:44)<joe6pack>Kadwiell: did you publish anything other than the thief game?
(11:38:20)<Kadwiell>well, Tribe for this year
(11:38:50)<Kadwiell>No non-nDRL yet
(11:39:33)<joe6pack>are you somewhere close to the_ru?
(11:39:59)<Kadwiell>Norway, so pretty close
(11:40:19)<joe6pack>yea but where in norway?
(11:40:51)<Kadwiell>Bergen now, will be Oslo after summer
(11:42:05)<joe6pack>then you are far away from him
(11:42:39)<joe6pack>can you get cheap flight from/to both of these?
(11:42:52)<Kadwiell>To Kiruna?
(11:43:03)<joe6pack>or to berlin ;)
(11:43:24)<Kadwiell>Ah.. I've never tried to travel to Kiruna, but I guess it would be pretty easy/cheap to get to Berlin
(11:43:41)<joe6pack>okai 
(11:43:59)<joe6pack>vote for it then :)
(11:44:05)<Kadwiell>I'm not sure I'll be attending the meet though, might be inconvenient with the starting of studies etc
(11:44:25)<joe6pack>so vote for a time that is convenient 
(11:44:37)<joe6pack>right now there is 1 vote for sep. and 1 for oct
(11:44:47)<joe6pack>but i could change my mind to august as well
(11:45:15)<joe6pack>it is non-obligating
(11:45:57)<RotateMe>oct isn't possible for you, ido?
(11:46:30)<joe6pack>it is, but sep would be more convenient. my studies start at 1st of oct
(11:46:40)<joe6pack>but i think there are holidays shortly thereafter
(11:46:45)<joe6pack>so it might be ok afterall
(11:47:18)<joe6pack>anyway it is too early to know. i don't know what i will do in 6 months
(11:47:59)<joe6pack>but don't need to worry to much for it now. if the date would be suboptimal we'll jsut discuss it and come up with something better
(11:59:30)<joe6pack>getting late
(11:59:40)<joe6pack>a lot of homework for tomorrow 
(11:59:45)<joe6pack>and the day after that 
(11:59:46)<joe6pack>:(

(12:01:19)<joe6pack>good night
(03:42:39)<cellyboy>hi
(08:44:17)<tekateru>good morning
(08:45:55)<tekateru>I wish I could go to the meeting.....
(12:41:28)<tekateru>anyone *alive* ?
(12:51:02)<Glowie>I am now
(01:24:36)<tekateru>good
(01:24:51)<tekateru>i need a coffeebreak roguelike
(01:25:27)<Glowie>DoomRL is probably the best pick
(01:25:53)<Glowie>Or any other Kornel's creation
(01:26:15)<tekateru>i need smth other than his creations - i've finished them all
(01:26:22)<Glowie>Haha
(01:26:40)<Glowie>Actually I haven't played smaller ones that much
(01:26:46)<tekateru>prince vs zombies is good
(01:26:53)<Glowie>How coffeebreak should it be?
(01:27:09)<Glowie>Is it a 7DRL or larger?
(01:28:01)<tekateru>doens't matter
(01:28:07)<tekateru>*doesn't
(01:28:32)<Glowie>I meant Prince vs Zombies
(01:29:13)<tekateru>it's a 7drl
(01:29:19)<Glowie>Okay
(01:29:22)<tekateru>altrough i can do it in 1 day
(01:29:28)<tekateru>2, i meant
(01:30:22)<Glowie>I've only played Slash's creations more than a day or two (and of course play tested my own if that counts)
(01:30:37)<Glowie>You might want to try them
(01:31:22)<tekateru>well it's a bit complicated as i finished/seen almost all RLs
(01:31:35)<Glowie>Slash's too?
(01:31:50)<Glowie>And I assume we aren't counting the major ones?
(01:31:56)<tekateru>yep: CastlevaniaRL, MegamamRL etc
(01:32:09)<Glowie>Did you actually beat CvRL O_O
(01:32:11)<tekateru>we're counting those I haven't played....
(01:32:31)<Glowie>(Coffeebreak refers to fast and small)
(01:32:38)<tekateru>yes
(01:32:46)<Glowie>Woah
(01:32:50)<Glowie>I found it hard
(01:33:45)<Glowie>Of course if you want quality, depth and longer commitment, try ADOM, Nethack, Crawl and perhaps even Angband and its variants, though I dislike them
(01:34:02)<tekateru>yes, I hate them too
(01:34:27)<tekateru>I'll try Alphaman, althrough it's not coffeebreak
(01:34:37)<Glowie>Have fun
(01:34:51)<Glowie>I didn't really get into it though the setting is interesting
(01:34:55)<RotateMe>try to beat RogueTower
(01:35:02)<RotateMe>for it has no end muwahahahaah
(01:38:00)<tekateru>roguetower is hard
(01:38:23)<RotateMe>yeah it's unbalanced
(01:38:30)<RotateMe>(i can say that because i made it)
(01:38:34)<tekateru>where are you from?
(01:39:04)<RotateMe>a friend of mine made it to tower level 30 and then starved because he got stunned so long that he couldn't eat
(01:39:06)<Glowie>Oh tekateru is deveah :)
(01:39:08)<RotateMe>germany
(01:39:12)<tekateru>good
(01:39:20)<tekateru>"+ Sry, the guys from funpic killed my files and space and I can't find a backup"
(01:39:34)<RotateMe>yeah one version is still there
(01:39:44)<tekateru>funpic is a hungarian site, so i had a flying thought you were too
(01:39:46)<RotateMe>i was as dumb as having my only backup online
(01:39:52)<RotateMe>ah, no
(01:40:32)<RotateMe>got to take the dog out now though, tell me if you reach higher then 10 or find any bugs
(01:40:44)<tekateru>i will
(02:31:01)<Aerton>I suggest Siberia, 1 august :-P
(02:31:18)<Aerton>it will be an eclipse
(02:31:32)<Aerton>and the next one is ~20 years later
(02:33:00)<Glowie>You can film it for us \o/
(03:08:29)<tekateru>a 12x9 rl will rock
(03:11:28)<DaEezT>a rocket launcher that fires 12 by 9 inch ammo?
(03:15:36)<tekateru>a 12x9 sized roguelike
(03:15:39)<tekateru>lazyfingers
(03:16:17)<Kadwiell>12x9 characters? Why exactly that size?
(03:16:29)<tekateru>it's 4:3 ratio size :D
(03:16:55)<Kadwiell>Wow, it's also stamp-sized
(03:17:19)<tekateru>and smaller sizes aren't accepted in cmd
(03:17:19)<Kadwiell>Sounds a bit restrictive
(03:17:50)<Kadwiell>Seems xterm lets me go all the way to 1x1. Very useful :)
(03:19:07)<tekateru>well cmd accepts sizes of 1x1, but it's showind the vbar and hbar
(03:21:22)<tekateru>*showing
(04:02:53)<RotateMe>hmmm when i start my game in debug mode i get this segmentation fault, when i compile it normally it works fine
(04:03:04)<RotateMe>plus i see no reason for the segmentation fault :(
(04:07:16)<Kadwiell>Debug mode meaning under a debugger?
(04:11:02)<RotateMe>yes
(04:11:05)<RotateMe>it's gone
(04:11:26)<Kadwiell>Spooky but convenient :)
(04:11:51)<RotateMe>it maybe was because i didn't initialize every object attribute before making something pointing to it
(04:11:57)<RotateMe>but i don
(04:12:10)<RotateMe>*but i don't see why this would lead to an error
(04:15:11)<RotateMe>and my monitor starts flickering more and more :(
(04:16:56)<Kadwiell>I doubt that's caused by a bug in your roguelike
(04:31:03)<RotateMe>^^ but still it's annoying
(04:50:09)<tekateru>hi ido
(04:50:19)<joe6pack>hi tekateru 
(04:50:23)<joe6pack>tekateru...
(04:50:26)<joe6pack>who are you?
(04:50:40)<tekateru>deveah
(04:50:46)<joe6pack>ah
(04:50:49)<joe6pack>thought so 
(04:50:51)<joe6pack>:(
(04:50:57)<joe6pack>have homework 
(04:51:01)<joe6pack>don't want to do them
(04:51:04)<tekateru>third client not working
(04:51:05)<joe6pack>but i should....
(05:29:13)<RotateMe>hi cellyboy
(05:29:26)<RotateMe>have you been here before?
(05:38:34)<tekateru>scrap is sweeeeeet!
(06:08:52)<joe6pack>cellyboy: are you still looking for a coffee break game?
(06:09:08)<joe6pack>was just reading the logs...
(06:09:23)<joe6pack>too bad i wasn't here to pimp cryptrover :p
(06:10:03)<RotateMe>was greating him about half an hour ago, he didn't answer yet...
(06:20:35)<RotateMe>why can't i use vectors as static members of classes?
(06:20:54)<joe6pack>i don't really know the STL that much 
(06:21:14)<RotateMe>i can declare them but as soon as i use them i get an "undefined reference bug
(06:21:37)<joe6pack>can't help you there, sorry 
(06:21:48)<joe6pack>and must get back to my homework as well ;(
(06:21:55)<RotateMe>okay thanks anyway
(08:28:39)<the_ru>so
(08:28:43)<the_ru>what are you listening to?
(08:29:09)<joe6pack>so hoe come
(08:29:14)<joe6pack>*how
(08:29:20)<the_ru>how come what?
(08:29:32)<joe6pack>name of the song i am listening to 
(08:29:38)<the_ru>a-ha
(08:29:44)<the_ru>what is it?
(08:29:54)<joe6pack>the beatles 
(08:29:58)<the_ru>a-ha
(08:30:14)<joe6pack>live at the bbc
(08:31:40)<the_ru>live recordings are usually good
(08:31:51)<the_ru>... or maybe they don't release the bad ones
(08:37:44)<joe6pack>what's up TMC?
(08:42:35)<the_ru>AHA
(08:42:39)<the_ru>I have poison!
(08:45:13)<Kadwiell>RotateMe: You have a definition of the static member as well as a declaration?
(09:01:47)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/Norther%20-%20Frozen%20Sky.mp3
(09:01:59)<the_ru>Great soundtrack for a roguelike ascension?
(09:05:01)<tekateru>cya
(09:07:05)<the_ru>jomiolto: what does your nick mean?
(09:07:14)<the_ru>I thought it was Santa Claus, but it seems not
(09:07:50)<the_ru>A colleague of mine often speaks of beings he calls "oultas", that are people you can see and talk to, but don't really exist
(09:08:15)<jomiolto>my nick? it's actually the two first letters of each of my names
(09:08:19)<the_ru>A-ha
(09:08:40)<the_ru>It does sound like a real finnish word :-O
(09:08:47)<jomiolto>well, kind of :)
(09:08:56)<the_ru>What was that, keksi keksin...?
(09:09:22)<jomiolto>hmm
(09:09:34)<jomiolto>I think I've heard something like that, but can't recall it at the moment
(09:09:54)<the_ru>it's something about the inventor invented a cracker
(09:10:10)<jomiolto>keksij√§ keksi keksin
(09:10:30)<the_ru>... yeah, something like that
(09:10:30)<jomiolto>sounds funny when you say it :)
(09:11:07)<the_ru>is that a tongue twister in Finland?
(09:11:31)<jomiolto>nah, not really. The real tongue twisters are much more difficult
(09:13:04)<jomiolto>like: "Appilan pappilan apupapin papupata pankolla kiehuu ja kuohuu."
(09:14:01)<jomiolto>or even better: Kokko, kokoo kokoon koko kokko! Koko kokkoko? Koko kokko.
(09:14:17)<jomiolto>(and yes, it actually does mean something :)
(09:14:27)<the_ru>what's the difference between k and kk?
(09:14:43)<the_ru>Kokko, kokoo kokoon koko kokko! Koko kokkoko?
(09:15:10)<jomiolto>k is a simple k, whereas kk has glottal stop (or something like that) in it
(09:15:25)<the_ru>I'm going to learn finnish some day, perhaps I'll start with something more basic
(09:15:38)<jomiolto>:)
(09:15:44)<the_ru>If only my GF hadn't lost our "learn by repeating" CDs
(09:16:02)<jomiolto>oh, ones about Finnish?
(09:16:02)<the_ru>They're still around here somewhere... But to find them in this mess!
(09:16:05)<the_ru>Yes
(09:16:10)<the_ru>She wants to learn too
(09:16:15)<jomiolto>why would anyone want to learn Finnish? :)
(09:16:24)<the_ru>None of us has had the energy to get started
(09:16:31)<the_ru>Well, lots of people around here use it
(09:16:39)<jomiolto>hmm, where were you from again?
(09:16:46)<jomiolto>Sweden?
(09:16:58)<the_ru>... or some weird variant of it, where half the words are made up or just the swedish word with an -i at the end
(09:17:05)<the_ru>Yes
(09:17:35)<jomiolto>well, there are actually a lot of words in Finnish that were borrowed from Swedish
(09:18:17)<the_ru>probably more than the other way around
(09:18:24)<jomiolto>yeah :)
(09:19:22)<jomiolto>that reminds me; I should really brush up my Swedish skills, or I'm going to fail the obligatory Swedish course the coming autumn :(
(09:19:58)<the_ru>at least I should learn enough to be able to look stuff up in a dictionary
(09:20:38)<jomiolto>yeah, once you get to that stage, it gets a lot easier
(09:21:06)<jomiolto>I'd personally love to learn several new languages, but there's never enough time...
(09:21:09)<the_ru>I don't know how you conjugate words and stuff, so just typing an arbitrary word into an online dictionary doesn't find anything :-/
(09:21:17)<the_ru>lojban?
(09:21:37)<jomiolto>what's that?
(09:21:55)<jomiolto>lolban :)
(09:22:18)<the_ru>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban
(09:22:51)<the_ru>http://xkcd.com/191/
(09:23:42)<jomiolto>never heard of it before, but looks quite interesting
(09:24:28)<the_ru>somehow it feels like the most useless language to learn
(09:24:53)<jomiolto>perhaps
(09:25:53)<the_ru>I wonder what lojban poetry would be like
(09:26:16)<the_ru>I'm sure there is some already, but I won't be able to read it :-/
(09:26:26)<joe6pack>the_ru: that would be klingon 
(09:26:33)<jomiolto>heh, I was just about to say the same
(09:26:59)<the_ru>aren't there people who use that for actual communication?
(09:27:08)<joe6pack>i know a gu+y who learned esperanto and insists that everyone should learn it as well
(09:27:16)<Kadwiell>I'm not quite sure that there are more Lojban speakers than Klingon speakers
(09:27:20)<joe6pack>and that it should be the official international language
(09:27:21)<Kadwiell>So it might be the other way around
(09:27:37)<the_ru>joe6pack: well, the intention is good - but who has the time?
(09:27:50)<joe6pack>he does, apparently :p
(09:27:58)<joe6pack>i told him he should just learn english instead 
(09:27:59)<the_ru>I know one of those as well
(09:28:08)<the_ru>esperanto advocate/general pain in the ass
(09:28:15)<joe6pack>exactly 
(09:28:21)<joe6pack>but a nice guy other than that 
(09:28:29)<the_ru>just like dem damn foolz insisting everyone should use Linux
(09:28:35)<Kadwiell>I think the idea is that it feels like cultural imperialism to just force everyone to learn English
(09:28:41)<joe6pack>he just have a lot of weird ideas
(09:28:47)<joe6pack>yes
(09:28:54)<Kadwiell>But of course Esperanto is not a very realistic alternative
(09:29:03)<joe6pack>maybe mandarin 
(09:29:08)<jomiolto>well, everyone should just learn Latin :)
(09:29:22)<joe6pack>it's the only alternative i see to english as the next world language 
(09:29:34)<jomiolto>Quenya!
(09:29:42)<joe6pack>jomiolto: maybe some simplified version thereof...
(09:29:59)<joe6pack>latin has quite a complicated grammer i think
(09:30:39)<the_ru>I was working with a friend to create a simplified and unambiguous swedish, it looked something like "xHUNAx rBRUNr"
(09:30:42)<joe6pack>anyway the world language always was and always will be the language of the current strongest empire 
(09:31:48)<Kadwiell>Seems quite probable
(09:32:16)<the_ru>or we can just wait for the babelfish
(09:32:17)<Kadwiell>In what sense is Lojban "logical", anyway? Is it like Newspeak, where it's impossible to formulate certain (illogical) ideas?
(09:34:03)<jomiolto>"I √•a √§ e √∂ √• i √∂a √§ e √•." :D
(09:36:01)<the_ru>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Xekri_je_blanu_nicte.ogg
(09:37:38)<the_ru>it sounds like an american reading a mix of german and arabic
(10:05:02)<joe6pack>i can imagine the arabic part
(10:05:12)<joe6pack>but i don't see the resemblance to German 
(10:38:25)<the_ru>mostly the "iche" parts
+++ The date has changed: 2008/04/04 +++
(01:11:22)<Kadwiell>Hm, has everyone seen Cristophe's FOV demo on rgrd from a few days back? That's actually a pretty nice way to show FOV in a SDL roguelike, in my opinion.. makes it very clear that what the background colour means, as well as where it's centered
(01:13:24)<cellyboy>hiya
(01:14:11)<cellyboy>Anyone who can suggest a good way to check collisions with monsters/walls/etc for example..
(01:14:41)<cellyboy>would it be appropriate to send a pointer to the Entity (monster/player/etc) in question with the world map.. and list of other entities?
(01:15:16)<cellyboy>and keep all the collision detection etc to be done by the Entity-class?
(01:16:13)<Kadwiell>Collisions as in whether x0==x1 && y0==y1?
(01:16:45)<Kadwiell>I'd say the LevelMap class or equivalent could handle that, but I'm probably not all that OO-orthodox in every way
(01:28:22)<cellyboy>hmm
(01:28:25)<cellyboy>so...
(01:28:41)<cellyboy>send a call for function that checks whether a square is occupied or not
(01:28:49)<cellyboy>like bool fooCheck(int x, int y); ?
(01:29:26)<cellyboy>that is held by the class containing the world map and creature list?
(01:29:40)<Kadwiell>Sounds good to me. If you use pointers or IDs and by "occupied" you mean that there is exactly one creature there already, then you could combine this
(01:30:08)<Kadwiell>with getCreatureAt: isOccupied(x,y) { return getCreatureAt(x,y) != NULL; }
(01:30:13)<cellyboy>I have a linked list containing all entities, and arrays for the World/Dungeon/Map/Tile's
(01:30:28)<cellyboy>yeah, i suppose that would work
(01:30:52)<cellyboy>Sending too many pointers here and there would be spaghetti as far as I can see it...
(01:31:09)<cellyboy>and would probably get me problems later on...
(01:31:14)<Kadwiell>Well, this is a code design issue, so the answer is probably "whatever you're most comfortable with"
(01:31:18)<cellyboy>yeah
(01:31:20)<cellyboy>i suppose
(01:31:57)<cellyboy>This is my third try for creating a roguelike, the last two tries I started in the wrong end and ended up in some kind've limbo where I couldnt do anything since it was like positioning a straight block through a round hole...
(01:32:13)<cellyboy>so this time i started off at the heart of the game as I see it, the EventHandler...
(01:32:41)<cellyboy>which handles whoms turn it is, and also handles all the effects and when they should take place...
(01:33:08)<cellyboy>learning by doing I guess it's called ;p
(01:33:17)<Kadwiell>That's where I started with my 7DRL.. but I changed my mind about how it should work during the seven days :)
(01:33:58)<cellyboy>yeah, but building the eventhandler around the events would be.. odd how I see it.. I guess one needs to adjust it, but the general idea is thought up already :)
(01:35:12)<Kadwiell>Yeah, event handler first is probably best.. just expect that you'll change your mind about things later
(01:35:29)<Kadwiell>I take it you're working on non-nDRL projects?
(01:35:34)<cellyboy>yeah, i suppose, but then most of the changes will happen in the Entity class and it's children...
(01:35:37)<cellyboy>yes
(01:35:50)<cellyboy>it's a long term project, or atleast I hope it will be :)
(01:35:59)<cellyboy>with 7drl
(01:36:10)<cellyboy>one can accept a portion of ugly code
(01:36:19)<cellyboy>since the project in general is fairly limited.
(01:36:32)<Kadwiell>Yeah
(01:36:57)<Kadwiell>I agree that a non-nDRL should be prettier, but code in general increases in entropy, is my experience
(01:37:12)<cellyboy>aye
(01:37:41)<cellyboy>i'm pretty happy about the eventhandler though, it's only limited in the way I chose to have my Entity class and it's children
(01:38:21)<cellyboy>Everything is an Entity, spells, effects, monsters, players, whatever I may see fit...
(01:38:44)<Kadwiell>And the common feature of entities is that they act in some manner controlled by the event handler?
(01:39:21)<cellyboy>basically each time an entity is looped through the eventhandler checks if it's that events turn to act, if it is, it calls a function onDefault(void)
(01:39:42)<cellyboy>which in turn calls upon either AI, player controls, whatever i chose...
(01:40:20)<cellyboy>I may add additional things later on, but for now this does the trick by far.
(01:40:22)<cellyboy>:)
(01:40:29)<Kadwiell>Sounds reasonable :)
(01:40:45)<cellyboy>The general idea I got from an article on roguebasin...
(01:41:00)<cellyboy>it's called "Elegant Roguelike...something..."
(01:41:09)<cellyboy>Elegant handler, or Elegant timekeeping or something..hmm
(01:42:04)<cellyboy>also allows for very very very distinct speeds for each unit.. the resolution for speed settings is huge
(01:42:31)<Kadwiell>Do you use something queuelike for the eventhandler?
(01:43:11)<cellyboy>a linked list containing all entities, which each contain a value "int currrentActionPoints" and "int initialActionPoints"
(01:43:21)<Kadwiell>Hm, also: something to keep in mind with huge speed setting resolutions
(01:43:24)<cellyboy>a unit with speed 20 is 5 times as fast as one with 100...
(01:43:40)<Kadwiell>That is generally my speed system as well :)
(01:44:06)<Kadwiell>But: the player may want to see all movement, getting --more-- prompts and such when there's an excess of movement before she gets to act
(01:44:20)<cellyboy>yeah, that's true...
(01:44:26)<Kadwiell>Is that possible? (I ask because I ignored this in my 7drl..)
(01:44:26)<cellyboy>atleast if something important happens
(01:44:29)<cellyboy>like getting attacked....
(01:44:41)<cellyboy>or getting cast a spell at...
(01:44:48)<cellyboy>general movement i wouldnt deem that neccesary...
(01:44:53)<Kadwiell>Or if it's a relatively long time until they get to act, such as if they're paralyzed or just fighting a very fast monster
(01:45:00)<cellyboy>aye
(01:45:07)<cellyboy>that's very possible...
(01:45:28)<cellyboy>Lets say a speed-20 monster hits a speed 100 player..
(01:45:55)<cellyboy>a --more-- prompt would be great, so the player doesnt suffer like 5 hits and has no idea what happened..
(01:46:09)<cellyboy>but that can be built in quite easily i suppose
(01:47:00)<cellyboy>one thing would be to just add it in the attack code...
(01:47:06)<Kadwiell>Yep, but it's an UI event outside the player's act()
(01:47:15)<Kadwiell>Which is easy to forget to plan for
(01:47:20)<cellyboy>hmmm
(01:47:37)<cellyboy>what do you mean?
(01:47:48)<cellyboy>I have my player as a separate child class under Entity...
(01:48:09)<cellyboy>with it's own onDefault() containing controls...
(01:48:21)<cellyboy>not sure if this is the right way to go, but it has worked fine so far :)
(01:48:30)<cellyboy>I'm not so far gone with the RL though :)
(01:49:20)<Kadwiell>I mean if you have all other UI stuff under Player->onDefault(), this might lead to some confusion later on
(01:49:50)<Kadwiell>But I think the general wisdom is to get the @ moving onscreen as soon as possible, and _then_ worry about the perfect design :)
(01:50:01)<cellyboy>welll
(01:50:13)<cellyboy>i tried that twice, and got stuck :p call me a newbie, but bah
(01:50:22)<cellyboy>it didn't work well for me ;)
(01:50:51)<cellyboy>when i tried to add any kind've general functionality i just had to bork the code into an unrecognizable pit of spaghetti :P
(01:51:47)<cellyboy>The controls are kept by player class, but the UI code is in a separate class UI...
(01:51:59)<cellyboy>i.e UI::message("Hiya!");
(01:52:07)<cellyboy>or UI::more();
(01:52:40)<Kadwiell>Okay, then it sounds like you will avoid that particular trap
(01:53:19)<Kadwiell>Just call UI::more() when the notification console fills up, something moves twice without an update, or something similar
(01:53:19)<cellyboy>lets hope so :o
(01:53:34)<cellyboy>but i guess one is in for a few surprises anyways ;6
(01:53:45)<cellyboy>AYE
(01:53:52)<cellyboy>thats the general idea :)
(01:54:20)<Kadwiell>Which is your project anyway? Might I have heard of it lurking on rgrd?
(01:54:38)<cellyboy>nope :)
(01:54:49)<cellyboy>i've never posted there...
(01:54:56)<cellyboy>i'm more of a lurker... and...
(01:55:25)<cellyboy>I am a novice programmer, coded some different toys and stuff earlier on, and then got my eyes on roguelikes
(01:55:39)<cellyboy>and thought, wow, this is a very very good way to be able to toy around with lots of different sollutions
(01:55:53)<cellyboy>I like the whole deal about random content
(01:56:12)<cellyboy>and I also saw it as a good way to get better at programming :)
(01:56:19)<Kadwiell>Yep, many cool algorithms in that area
(01:56:26)<cellyboy>also played a lot of nethack
(01:56:28)<cellyboy>:p
(01:56:41)<cellyboy>and that really got me
(01:57:00)<cellyboy>I found it so neat that you could do basically anything you could think o
(01:57:18)<cellyboy>i.e. just a thing like falling into a pit carrying a cockatrice corpse would stone you :P
(01:57:24)<Kadwiell>Yeah, that's cool in NH
(01:57:25)<cellyboy>pure genious
(01:57:29)<Kadwiell>Not so cool when you actually do that
(01:57:38)<cellyboy>only happens once :P
(01:57:47)<Kadwiell>Yep
(01:58:31)<cellyboy>got an ascendant candidate on alt.org
(01:58:41)<cellyboy>but i let it rest :P
(01:58:54)<Kadwiell>I've ascended an orcish rogue once :) But it was a wild streak of luck
(01:59:10)<cellyboy>:D
(01:59:11)<Kadwiell>I've never even come close again..
(01:59:21)<cellyboy>hmm, gonna see what i was playing
(01:59:23)<cellyboy>valkyrie i think...hmm
(02:01:37)<cellyboy>hmm
(02:01:44)<cellyboy>cant freaking rememeber my nickname :o
(02:02:18)<Kadwiell>Hehe, that's the trouble with remote servers
(02:06:30)<cellyboy>HAH
(02:06:31)<cellyboy>urbax2
(02:06:31)<cellyboy>:P
(02:08:19)<Kadwiell>Killed by an iron golem :/
(02:08:26)<Kadwiell>At least you got a whole lot of points
(02:08:28)<cellyboy>hmm
(02:08:39)<cellyboy>uhm
(02:08:42)<cellyboy>what the heck :P
(02:08:46)<cellyboy>I thought he lived...:s
(02:09:39)<cellyboy>bleh
(02:10:30)<cellyboy>ah
(02:10:32)<Kadwiell>Tried ADOM or GearHead? I've never completed either of those, but they're quite fun
(02:10:33)<cellyboy>server crashed probably
(02:10:43)<cellyboy>tried gearhead a little...
(02:10:47)<cellyboy>but i never got the hang of it
(02:11:01)<cellyboy>ADOM havnt tried, only heard about, played a bit of Powder
(02:11:12)<cellyboy>since I have a nintendo DS that's the only viable alternative for portables :)
(02:11:23)<cellyboy>well, nethack too, but it's much more cumbersome to play...

(02:11:30)<Kadwiell>Hm, okay, I've only read about that on rgrd
(02:11:46)<Kadwiell>Yeah, NH must be a nightmare without a keyboard :)
(02:15:55)<cellyboy>hmmm
(02:16:12)<cellyboy>had some pretty rad equipmen...
(02:16:17)<cellyboy>it must've crashed...
(02:17:05)<Kadwiell>alt.org? :/
(02:17:17)<cellyboy>yeah, effectively removing my game :)
(02:17:51)<Kadwiell>That's a shame
(09:47:57)<tekateru>hello
(11:11:40)<tekateru>i hate having a song stuck in my mind and not knowing where it comes from
(07:47:03)<Kadwiell>Does anyone have any experience with making Markov chains suitable for name generation?
(07:47:59)<Kadwiell>I've added a filter for length, but the result still has a tendency to just string nearly-complete source names together
(07:51:18)<Kadwiell>Depth 2 (instead of 3) does work pretty well, actually, but then the names perhaps stray a little too far from the source style
(09:04:32)<Epyon_>Kadwiell, I have a pascal unit for that somewhere that produces quite nice names.
(09:08:43)<jomiolto>opintotukip√§iv√§ <3
(09:08:46)<jomiolto>ops :(
(09:08:52)<jomiolto>sorry for that
(09:10:01)<Kadwiell>Do you use Markov chains? Is there a way to balance more finely than integral "depth"?
(09:10:54)<Kadwiell>I guess some of the reason I'm dissatisfied with my current output is because I've been seeding it with a list of real names for testing.. and random rehashes of those sound pretty silly
(09:13:07)<joe6pack>purestrain: are you there?

(09:36:53)<joe6pack>i'll send him that
(09:38:18)<joe6pack>another one!
(09:38:25)<joe6pack>so quickly... 
(09:38:25)<purestrain>but i think your sentence is ok too for a non native german speaker
(09:40:08)<joe6pack>thanks. i can speak german already, but i still have problems with the grammar

(12:45:12)<TMC>thanks
(12:45:56)<TMC>I wonder where the problem is
(01:20:51)<the_ru>deveah: isn't there any better place to take your ideology discussions?
(01:33:36)<TMC>which (open source) rl's have really complicated extensive map generators?
(01:33:59)<the_ru>how extensive?
(01:34:05)<TMC>I just planned out my map (floorplan) generator at a high level, and it's shockingly complicated
(01:34:26)<joe6pack>the generator or the map?
(01:34:29)<TMC>well, adaptable to many totally different maps
(01:34:34)<TMC>yeah
(01:34:45)<joe6pack>i don't think it needs to be complicated to generate good maps 
(01:34:45)<TMC>I need randomly generated buildings
(01:34:58)<the_ru>how large?
(01:35:15)<the_ru>5x5 tiles or 50x50?
(01:35:17)<TMC>from houses up to castles and mansions
(01:35:25)<the_ru>do they need any structure or just random rooms thrown together?
(01:35:46)<TMC>semi realistic sturcture is preferable
(01:35:54)<TMC>well, necessary really
(01:36:09)<the_ru>the "divide rooms into smaller rooms" algorithm should do a decent job then
(01:36:22)<TMC>but real buildings have hallways
(01:36:34)<the_ru>i.e. decide on an area to build on,ÔøΩ split it in two, then do the ame thing recursively on the parts
(01:36:47)<TMC>and I having a tough time figuring out how to place the corridors
(01:36:58)<the_ru>then split them into three parts, where the center in just 1 tile wide
(01:37:07)<TMC>hmmmmm
(01:37:26)<the_ru>It works pretty well in TSL
(01:37:44)<TMC>what is TSL again?
(01:37:52)<TMC>your game, but I haven't played it
(01:37:53)<the_ru>The Slimy Lichmummy
(01:37:55)<the_ru>yes
(01:37:57)<TMC>ah
(01:38:27)<the_ru>wait 1 second
(01:38:34)<the_ru>... or maybe a bit longer
(01:38:38)<TMC>did you put in corridors or just split each room in 2?
(01:40:23)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/divide.png
(01:40:41)<the_ru>I don't generate them specifically, but they are often created anyway
(01:40:55)<the_ru>that is the algorithm I described, with a few tweaks
(01:41:19)<the_ru>it can also generate rooms within rooms, but that isn't shown there
(01:41:34)<the_ru>i.e. a block of rooms that is completely contained within another room
(01:41:54)<the_ru>it also builds moats randomly, with the same method
(01:41:58)<TMC>do you use several different map generators for tsl?
(01:42:06)<the_ru>yes
(01:42:23)<the_ru>really just two right now
(01:42:33)<the_ru>and then two or three more derived from one of those
(01:43:34)<TMC>hmmm
(01:43:51)<TMC>this map doesn't look much like it was crated by repeatively splitting!
(01:44:14)<the_ru>it was
(01:44:19)<TMC>you just carve a rectangular chunk out of the room?
(01:44:29)<the_ru>but then I run another algorithm over it that removes random walls
(01:45:17)<the_ru>the 1st recursion takes the whole map as arguments
(01:45:22)<TMC>oh, so you actually just split each room (which starts rectangular) with a single straight line?
(01:45:29)<the_ru>yes
(01:46:23)<the_ru>you can even write it so that it *always* generates connected maps
(01:46:33)<TMC>neat, removing walls seems pretty powerful then
(01:47:12)<the_ru>as you can see, I fill random areas with walls completely - removing a few % from the valid map ration
(01:47:28)<the_ru>but I already have tests for it anyway, and I like the extra randomness
(01:48:03)<the_ru>just keep splitting them until the rooms get as small as you want them
(01:48:21)<the_ru>and with a few special cases you can have all the hallways you want
(01:49:42)<TMC>yes
(01:49:52)<TMC>thanks, that was very helpful
(01:50:34)<TMC>removing walls would be an easy way to keep rooms above a minimum size, with interesting shpes and easy placement
(01:51:27)<the_ru>you
(01:51:41)<the_ru>will have to figure out how to make non-rectangular houses, though :-)
(01:51:48)<the_ru>but it shouldn't be too hard
(01:51:51)<the_ru>and gardens!
(01:51:58)<the_ru>gotta have gardens inside the mansions!
(01:53:08)<TMC>yep
(01:53:26)<TMC>the interior of the buildings will be very important
(01:53:44)<TMC>so there will be no such thing as an empty room
(01:53:55)<TMC>unless it's a storage room or other special case
(01:54:20)<the_ru>you can decide that every time you "close" the recursion
(01:54:57)<the_ru>but - putting them together in a logical manner might prove more difficult
(01:55:14)<the_ru>why are the stables next to the kings bedroom? why is the kitchen next to the dungeon?
(01:55:27)<the_ru>are they making supper from the prisoners?
(01:55:47)<TMC>from the prisoners? oO
(01:55:55)<the_ru>but OTOH - is the player allowed to just walk around a castle as he wishes?
(01:56:13)<TMC>I plan on a top down assignment of "areas"
(01:56:33)<the_ru>ok
(01:56:44)<TMC>such as, for a home, start by splitting the building into living/kitchen/dining and sleeping areas
(01:56:54)<TMC>then the sleeping area is split into bedrooms and bathrooms
(01:57:05)<the_ru>makes sense
(01:57:23)<the_ru>then you could control what areas end up next to each other
(01:57:27)<the_ru>but now, I must depart
(01:57:31)<the_ru>BBL
(01:57:37)<TMC>and the other is split into kitchen/pantry/dining (which is in turn split into those rooms), and whatever else... living/study
(01:57:40)<TMC>ok
(01:57:42)<TMC>bye
(02:06:04)<deveah>bye
(02:47:29)<the_ru>deveah: how do you expect people *not* to judge you and your game, considering that its objective would be judging (and killing) others?
(02:49:03)<the_ru>I think most people would find it very hard to identify with *that* protagonist
(02:49:30)<deveah>well it would sell in Romania
(02:49:55)<the_ru>really? are there that many nationalist roguelike players there?
(02:50:23)<deveah>roguelike players, not so much - but nationalists are 70%
(02:53:18)<the_ru>I think racism could be a very interesting concept in games - but it'd have to be from the oppressed peoples point of view
(02:54:02)<the_ru>and if there was some context to it, historically accurate, etc
(02:55:25)<the_ru>Ultima 7 had a lot of social problems, among other the conflict between gargoyles and humans
(02:58:16)<deveah>the year 2040: after the magyar pressure over Transilvania, Romanians have counter-attacked. Now Transilvania is magyar-free!
(03:12:36)<the_ru>the problem is that if you're a majority killing a minority, it's not liberation, it's genocide
(03:16:40)<Epyon_>Woohoo ge-no-cide!
(03:16:53)<Epyon_>There's nothing like some genocide to make your day xP
(03:20:17)<deveah>in Secuime, a Romanian place, hungarian people are more than 80%
(03:20:24)<deveah>they're the majority there
(03:20:41)<deveah>but still, they're in Romania, and they have to behave
(03:20:48)<the_ru>so why should they belong to Romania?
(03:21:27)<deveah>the place was populated by Romanian people, but when magyars came, they were too hostile so Romanian people left the place
(03:21:45)<deveah>it's a region that holds a big part of the Romanian gold
(03:21:56)<deveah>that's why the filthy magyars settled there
(03:22:18)<deveah>they even gathered women and kids into barns, and then burnt the barns down!
(03:22:32)<TMC>gold?
(03:22:32)<deveah>it's _our_ turn to genocide them
(03:22:38)<deveah>yes, gold
(03:22:49)<the_ru>that sounds like a war, then
(03:22:50)<deveah>in Rosia Montana
(03:22:54)<the_ru>where was your army?
(03:23:03)<Kadwiell>Genocide by turns, that's history for you
(03:23:33)<deveah>some jewish people came to power and ordered a law that xenophobism in Romania should be prohibited
(03:23:46)<TMC>good for them
(03:23:47)<deveah>but noone listens, and that's good
(03:23:58)<the_ru>heh
(03:24:01)<TMC>good for me
(03:24:05)<the_ru>so now the jews are involved as well
(03:24:09)<TMC>good night
(03:24:31)<deveah>on hungary's national day, a group of young nationalists went there and beat some filthy activists
(03:24:49)<the_ru>I see a light on the horizon
(03:24:54)<deveah>they started (the magyars) to gather and request Transilvania
(03:24:59)<the_ru>it's... godwins law, racing towards us!
(03:25:10)<TMCNight>no! it's dawn!
(03:25:36)<TMCNight>bedtime for everyone who's not filthy activist!
(03:26:35)<deveah>I'd tell you jokes with magyars, if you'd understand Romanian humour
(03:26:50)<the_ru>I doubt anyone cares
(03:27:14)<Kadwiell>Interestingly, we'd probably have heard them before.. racist jokes tend to be very search-and-replace, in my experience
(03:29:01)<deveah>this one's a classic: a magyar walked near a fountain with a romanian guy near to it. The romanian guy quickly said "the water's opisoned, do not drink it!", but when he realised the guy was a magyar he said "you can drink it, but it's cold"
(03:29:06)<the_ru>I used to work with a guy whose jokes always began with "there was a negro that..."
(03:33:11)<the_ru>and nationalists/racists love to portray themselves as the victim, even when they are the majority that has all the privilegies
(03:58:31)<purestrain>hehe
(03:58:37)<purestrain>those jokes are the best :-)
(05:23:05)<the_ru>Hm
(05:23:18)<the_ru>What do you think, should Stealth be an attribute or a skill?
(05:23:22)<the_ru>I'm leaning towards skill
(05:25:18)<the_ru>If it was a skill, where would that leave Perception and Dodge?
(05:25:55)<Kadwiell>Skill would be the conventional choice.. are Perception and Dodge attributes in your game?
(05:26:01)<the_ru>Yes
(05:26:14)<the_ru>I'm pondering if Dodge should be a skill with Speed as base attribute
(05:26:21)<Kadwiell>Dodge seems very specific.. but it does become very important for a skill if it's a skill
(05:26:53)<the_ru>I used to have Evasion which was a combination of dodge and stealth
(05:27:58)<the_ru>I don't think it matters much
(05:28:16)<the_ru>I don't really need to have a symmetric skill tree or anything
(05:30:14)<the_ru>and I wonder how visible my skills should be
(05:30:26)<the_ru>should they all be on a list, or should they just appear as they are learned?
(05:30:43)<the_ru>the second approach would offer more replayability, I think
(05:31:15)<the_ru>even if you "know" the game, you can pursue some obscure combination of skills that have some kind of synergic effect
(05:32:19)<Kadwiell>To the spoiled player it probably won't matter whether they are listed or not
(05:32:44)<Kadwiell>But whether getting the first skill point / "learning the skill" is a huge issue does matter, of course
(05:32:58)<Kadwiell>Do you plan to restrict the number of skills a player can learn?
(05:33:03)<the_ru>well, it could make it easier for new players
(05:33:19)<the_ru>if they only need to be concerned about the skills they know - no need to wonder "What does that do?"
(05:33:27)<the_ru>well, not really
(05:33:31)<the_ru>they skills are active all the time
(05:33:45)<the_ru>they're just modifiers to the success rolls of your actions
(05:35:17)<the_ru>and should attributes care about skills?
(05:35:35)<Kadwiell>Hm, then it could be good to have them all listed as well, so new player can know what areas they may improve at later
(05:35:36)<the_ru>like, if you have an extremely high dodge skill, it ought to "wear off" on your general Speed attribute
(05:36:05)<Kadwiell>So they can think "I'm apparently useless at stealth at the moment" rather than "stealth seems to be useless in this game"
(05:36:38)<the_ru>hm
(05:36:47)<the_ru>well, OTOH, some characters shouldn't know about some skills
(05:37:06)<the_ru>like a fighter that doesn't care about magic shouldn't even be aware what different magic schools there are
(05:37:39)<Kadwiell>Well, if your game is strict-classed and there are some skills that are just plain useless for some classes, you could just hide them
(05:38:00)<Kadwiell>But someone who's not a rogue might want to learn stealth, for instance..
(05:38:35)<the_ru>yes, but that is done in other ways
(05:39:10)<the_ru>character advancement will probably be through choices you make at "checkpoints"
(05:39:43)<the_ru>the checkpoints will be statues at the end of the various areas, that house ancient spirits that share their knowledge
(05:40:07)<the_ru>so you never browse a skill list and think "hm, what could be useful here"
(05:40:15)<Kadwiell>Hm, right
(05:42:09)<the_ru>it's more take what you can get and make the best of it
(05:42:12)<Kadwiell>Not a bad idea, equating character and spatial progress
(05:42:27)<Kadwiell>But still, I think roguelike players will always want to plan ahead to some degree
(05:43:06)<Kadwiell>If you find the Cloak of Awesome Stealth, you'll want to hang onto it only if you think that your character will ever have a chance in the stealth parts of the game
(05:43:25)<Kadwiell>So it's a useful thing to know even when you're not "leveling up"
(05:43:29)<the_ru>I don't have any experience, levels or classes :-)
(05:43:57)<the_ru>it's a bit hard to come up with any other system that works, but I hope I'll be able to create something new
(05:45:24)<the_ru>stealth is the biggest issue - there's no good way to award experience for stealth
(05:45:37)<the_ru>and I want to encourage non-melee paths of action
(05:45:45)<Kadwiell>Yeah, it's good to avoid copying the D&D cliches just because everyone else does it :)
(05:46:00)<jraregris>you could reward "not being seen"
(05:46:39)<Kadwiell>Or award points for the strength hostiles who are still unaware of you when you are exiting a level
(05:46:45)<Kadwiell>strength of*
(05:47:25)<the_ru>yes, but it's tricky
(05:47:29)<the_ru>both suggestions
(05:47:54)<the_ru>you don't really do anything to not be seen, you just run and hope it will work out
(05:48:05)<Kadwiell>Heh
(05:48:15)<Kadwiell>You don't have something like a "hiding" mode?
(05:48:21)<jraregris>yeah, but the game does "isSeen()"-checks, no?
(05:48:39)<Kadwiell>Or just shadows and LOS like in Thief
(05:48:49)<the_ru>just shadows and LOS
(05:48:55)<the_ru>jraregris: yes
(05:49:04)<the_ru>but sooner or later, you'll get caught anyway
(05:49:17)<the_ru>if you try to improve stealth by just walking around
(05:49:34)<Kadwiell>Is your game linear, in the sense that there's a "goal" (down-stairs etc) for most levels?
(05:49:46)<the_ru>haven't decided yet
(05:50:16)<the_ru>half the game will probably be linear, then you get to a portal and can choose which worlds you wish to explore
(05:50:32)<the_ru>but most worlds will have a "goal", yes
(05:50:35)<Kadwiell>Hm, okay.. that would make it easier to award experience for sneaking past things, because there would be a definite point where you would be "past" them
(05:50:48)<the_ru>but what if you go back?
(05:51:21)<Kadwiell>Don't know.. you obviously shouldn't get any experience for just going upstairs and downstairs again :)
(05:51:33)<the_ru>and what if a certain level is really easy, e.g. if the up and down stairs appear right next to each other
(05:51:36)<jraregris>you could get fitter tighs
(05:51:46)<the_ru>...
(05:51:50)<the_ru>this isn't Nethack :-)
(05:51:56)<jraregris>:P
(05:51:59)<Kadwiell>But what exactly is the stealth skill used for, if stealth is just utilizing shadows and LOS?
(05:52:12)<the_ru>you get a stealth bonus for moving in shadow
(05:52:20)<the_ru>and from stealth skill, of course
(05:52:33)<the_ru>it's rolled against the perception of each creature within sight
(05:52:45)<the_ru>or rather, each creature that can see *you*
(05:52:53)<Kadwiell>Ah, right.. but if you're really good at stealth you can stay hidden even without shadows?
(05:52:59)<the_ru>yes
(05:53:12)<the_ru>with unrealistic attributes
(05:53:42)<the_ru>equipment also plays a part... noisy armor vs. dark clothes
(05:54:24)<Kadwiell>One potential problem is that players who play "stealthily" would try to avoid isSeen() checks at all, by staying outside monster LOS
(05:54:33)<the_ru>indeed
(05:54:45)<Kadwiell>Meaning that the stealth skill would paradoxically matter less for them..
(05:55:16)<the_ru>there should be sound as well, but it doesn't work well yet
(05:55:32)<the_ru>I also have code for a track-by-scent system for monsters, but it's commented out ATM
(05:56:16)<jraregris>you could a have a basic xp-bonus (or similar) just for being in a monsters radius undetected
(05:56:37)<Kadwiell>Would encourage "thieves" to act pretty foolishly, though
(05:56:50)<the_ru>it's too hard to balance
(05:57:05)<the_ru>either it would be too easy to advance that way, or it would be so hard that no one would bother
(05:57:25)<the_ru>I think it's better to base advancement on accomplishment
(05:57:29)<Kadwiell>Tracking by scent sounds pretty complicated.. you could just fake it by saying that a monster that can smell you automatically knows where you are
(05:57:37)<the_ru>finding the statues, or whatever the checkpoint happens to be
(05:57:59)<the_ru>then you get a 2 or 3-way choice, like fighter/mage/thief
(05:58:05)<the_ru>it's quite easy actually
(05:58:18)<Kadwiell>I mean for the player to keep track of
(05:58:20)<the_ru>you leave a certain amount of your scent on each tile
(05:58:27)<the_ru>then it decays over time
(05:58:36)<the_ru>the monsters just move in the direction it's strongest
(05:58:43)<Kadwiell>Ah, that does sound pretty neat technically, worth keeping I guess :)
(05:59:08)<the_ru>I haven't yet figured out how to switch the monsters to scent-tracking when the player runs out of view
(05:59:27)<the_ru>it also opens up new tactics... sprinkling pepper on the floor? :-)
(06:00:29)<Kadwiell>Hehe
(06:00:36)<the_ru>BBIAB, dinner
(06:01:00)<Kadwiell>Also, if you have or plan to put polymorphing in your game, makes for some interesting gameplay when playing as a scent-sensitive monster
(06:37:59)<the_ru>I have it
(06:38:16)<the_ru>And to complicate matters further, the player also has to make the same rolls for seeing the enemies
(07:09:46)<the_ru>what do you think of different poisons?
(07:10:22)<the_ru>instead of your HP just ticking away, it could cause other effects as well
(07:10:37)<the_ru>permanent strength loss, blindness, paralysation, etc
(07:10:52)<jomiolto>hallucinations? :)
(07:11:13)<the_ru>why not?
(07:11:24)<the_ru>they would be hard to do the way I want them though :-)
(07:11:48)<the_ru>Nethack-style with randomly cycling monster names isn't very exciting
(07:13:49)<joe6pack>look at the way alan's psychedelic journey handeled it
(07:14:05)<jomiolto>well, you could make the rooms extend and shrink randomly (if your dungeon levels have rooms) and then make random hallucinatory monsters appear out of no where (and disappear when you try to fight them)
(07:14:24)<jomiolto>joe6pack: that isn't really much better than what Nethack does :)
(07:14:53)<joe6pack>i don't know what nethack does,
(07:15:03)<the_ru>well, IMO hallucinations must instill fear and confusion in the *player*, not the character
(07:15:09)<joe6pack>but the walls randomly changeing position is pretty confusing 
(07:15:48)<jomiolto>the_ru: not all hallucinations are scary, some can be quite funny actually :)
(07:15:52)<Kadwiell>Perhaps generate random monsters that behave consistently, but don't actually do damage?
(07:16:09)<the_ru>yeah, but they have to be believable for the player
(07:16:22)<the_ru>if a character sees a dragon, he ought to be all like "oh shit"
(07:16:49)<the_ru>but if the player can tell a dragon shouldn't appear at that place, he sees right through it
(07:17:15)<jomiolto>hippie hallucinations: colourful flowers appearing out of nowhere and monsters starting to sing and dance together in peace :)
(07:17:42)<the_ru>jomiolto: same thing there, the *player* will still now that he should attack the happy flowers :-)
(07:17:42)<Kadwiell>The player could mistake something real for something else.. like thinking a dragon is a newt
(07:18:41)<the_ru>I think it could work to spawn "illusionary" monsters
(07:18:51)<the_ru>they need to be properly themed, though
(07:19:06)<the_ru>a half-dozen goblins could appear as a hundred
(07:19:10)<jomiolto>yeah, just make them appear out of the line of sight and then have them move closer to you, so they won't just appera out of thin air
(07:19:38)<the_ru>that's no problem for me - they can do that anyway
(07:19:42)<the_ru>if they sneak up on you
(07:20:06)<jomiolto>oh, okay
(07:20:09)<the_ru>now I must go deposit some biological weapons in the toilet
(07:20:12)<the_ru>seeeeeeee ya
(07:20:17)<jomiolto>:)
(07:20:19)<the_ru>(I hope)
(08:44:16)<the_ru>Hm hm
(08:44:20)<the_ru>Anyone alive?
(08:44:48)<the_ru>A-ha-ha.
(09:08:09)<jomiolto>hmm, I must be really tired: I was reading some roguelike newsgroup and I read "scroll of identify" as "scroll of virginity" :D
(09:08:16)<jomiolto>I wonder what the use of such thing would be?
(09:08:26)<the_ru>what if it was cursed?
(09:08:35)<jomiolto>ouch, that might be bad
(09:08:58)<the_ru>Ultima 7 kept track of your virginity :-O
(09:09:15)<jomiolto>really? was it actually used for something?
(09:09:21)<the_ru>yes
(09:09:21)<joe6pack>so did fallout 2, iirc
(09:09:27)<jomiolto>:O
(09:09:37)<jomiolto>I never knew that
(09:09:44)<the_ru>there was a unicorn that would tell you if you were or not
(09:09:54)<the_ru>and after a pleasant night at "the baths", you weren't.
(09:10:21)<the_ru>P√ñart 2 got much more graphical though
(09:14:33)<jomiolto>hmm, if you had moral or moods, or something like that in your game, you would have a use for sex, and then you could implement a dating mini-game inside the game :)
(09:14:48)<the_ru>dating mini-game?
(09:14:50)<the_ru>you mean
(09:14:53)<the_ru>rape sim?
(09:15:08)<jomiolto>huh?
(09:16:30)<the_ru>"What would you like to bring to the date? a) flowers b) chocolate c) chloroform, latex gloves, 30 ft of rope, a shovel"
(09:16:36)<jomiolto>oh, right
(09:18:02)<the_ru>I wonder if there are any highschool IF adventures
(09:18:08)<jomiolto>those dating games used to be fun as a teenager, but I'm not sure if they would be anymore
(09:18:19)<the_ru>YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY TO DETENTION. GOING DOWN THE HALLWAY, YOU SEE A MAN BREAKING INTO A LOCKER.
(09:20:01)<the_ru>YOU ENCOUNTER THE GIRL YOU HAVE HAD A CRUSH ON FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS.
(09:20:04)<the_ru>> say hi
(09:20:12)<the_ru>THE GIRL REPLIES: "WHAT YOU SAY!!"
(09:20:17)<the_ru>> rape girl
(09:20:29)<the_ru>THE GIRL REPLIES: "YOU HAVE NO CHANCE TO SURVIVE MAKE YOUR TIME"
(09:29:08)<jomiolto>making good abstractions is really difficult
(09:29:50)<jomiolto>either they become too specific and can't be reused, or if they're general enough, then they won't simplify the task they're trying to accomplish enough
(09:30:19)<the_ru>huh
(09:30:23)<the_ru>what are you talking about now?
(09:30:39)<jomiolto>I'm talking about my roguelike library that should work for 2-3 different roguelikes
(09:31:14)<jomiolto>I guess I'm setting too high standards
(09:31:30)<the_ru>example?
(09:32:20)<jomiolto>I want to, for example, support both tile graphics and ASCII without having to write both of them from the ground up
(09:32:38)<jomiolto>but it's just that tile graphics are in so many ways different from ASCII
(09:32:53)<the_ru>they shouldn't be, to the caller
(09:33:19)<the_ru>it should just be a matter of display_tile(y, x, tile) either way
(09:33:24)<jomiolto>yeah, that's the thing, I want the same code to work for both, but there are some differences between them that make it very difficult
(09:33:38)<the_ru>such as?
(09:34:28)<the_ru>I guess sometimes you have to settle for the least common denominator
(09:34:33)<jomiolto>like the fact that ASCII only shows one "tile" at a time in a single place, while in tile graphics you might see a glimpse of an item under a monster and then a glimpse of the level tile under it
(09:34:50)<the_ru>then store it in layers
(09:35:12)<the_ru>tile, item, creature, effects (spells, etc)
(09:35:32)<the_ru>I currently have tile, trap, item, creature
(09:35:44)<jomiolto>that's what I'm basically doing now, but it complicates the code :/
(09:36:40)<the_ru>I don't see why it should
(09:36:50)<the_ru>unless you use some very sophisticated level memory or something
(09:37:10)<the_ru>I just remember the wall/floor layout, no items or such things like Nethack does
(09:37:48)<jomiolto>my code also remembers items, but that's not really the problem
(09:38:24)<jomiolto>with simple one tile at a single location all you need to do is to get the tile at x, y and paint it, if it's visible, but when you can have a stack of tiles, you need to paint them in order
(09:38:43)<the_ru>ok?
(09:38:44)<jomiolto>and the problem is that those tiles come from different places
(09:38:57)<jomiolto>monsters are in a different place, items in another diffrent place, and so on
(09:39:03)<the_ru>yes
(09:39:17)<the_ru>but what is the problem? just loop across those structures then?
(09:39:21)<jomiolto>I've been thinking about storing them all in a single list, and using some kind of polymorphism, but that once again makes it more complicated :)
(09:39:54)<jomiolto>well, there's no real problem, but I'd just like to keep the code as simple as possible
(09:39:57)<the_ru>I have the map as a 2D array, which overlaps with the level memory, then traps and items in a linked list, and creatures in an array
(09:41:07)<jomiolto>anyway, that is nothing compared to having support for animations and such, and still trying to make it work with same code as the ASCII
(09:41:29)<the_ru>is it threaded?
(09:41:32)<jomiolto>nope
(09:41:36)<the_ru>a-ha
(09:41:42)<jomiolto>but I think I have a nice solution for it
(09:41:43)<the_ru>well, animations could be a problem then
(09:42:45)<jomiolto>I'm just going to abstract the event loop away from the game to the library, so the different parts of the library can implement the event loop in different ways and handle animation and such
(09:43:08)<the_ru>the event loop?
(09:43:16)<the_ru>the same place the game logic takes place in?
(09:43:19)<jomiolto>uhm, yeah I think that's what it's called
(09:43:35)<jomiolto>nope, it just reads the input from user and calls the correct "event handlers"
(09:43:51)<jomiolto>then the game logic will take place in those event handlers
(09:44:00)<the_ru>when do monsters get to move?
(09:44:24)<jomiolto>they move after an event
(09:44:35)<jomiolto>it's turn based, so that won't be a problem
(09:45:01)<the_ru>what if you want to pause the game between different actions?
(09:45:11)<the_ru>like a monster firing an arrow - the player should have a chance to see it
(09:45:31)<the_ru>how does that work with the animation loop?
(09:46:03)<jomiolto>that is another problem, because such things would look quite different on ASCII and graphics
(09:46:50)<jomiolto>but it could be either implemented by the event loop (disable event handling until the arrow has hit something) or by the game logic code
(09:47:46)<the_ru>heh
(09:47:50)<the_ru>well, roguelikes are hard
(09:48:03)<jomiolto>but that is one of the things where I'm probably going to have to write different code for ASCII and graphics
(09:48:03)<the_ru>since the data and presentation are so tightly connected
(09:48:22)<jomiolto>yeah, I've noticed that during the years I've tried to develop a roguelike :)
(09:48:40)<the_ru>I think you should try to keep the game logic in the game code
(09:48:46)<jomiolto>yes, I know
(09:49:21)<the_ru>either that, or create a separate thread that deals with animation and stuff. then you could only set a few flags to update what's going on on-screen
(09:49:39)<the_ru>but you'd still need to manually flush updates if it's running in text mode
(09:50:21)<jomiolto>well, I could use threads for graphics, but I don't think I'm going that way for ASCII -- I wan't to keep the ASCII stuff as simple as possible
(09:50:51)<the_ru>probably a good idea
(09:51:05)<the_ru>and thanks for reminding me why I'm not making a graphical version :-)
(09:51:11)<jomiolto>heh :)
(09:51:40)<the_ru>I'm pondering making one just to see how well logic and UI separates...
(09:51:41)<jomiolto>I wasn't originally going to do that either, but after I found a nice tile set and saw how different the game looked and felt with graphics, I just had to go for it
(09:51:50)<the_ru>but I have other things I'd like to work on for now
(09:51:59)<the_ru>which one?
(09:52:02)<the_ru>Lost Dragons?
(09:52:11)<jomiolto>hmm, I'm sure where I found it
(09:52:41)<jomiolto>there were tiles for Crawl and Nethack I think, 32x32
(09:52:58)<the_ru>A-ha
(09:53:11)<the_ru>http://www.lostdragon.com/tiles/db-bmp-tiles.zip
(09:53:17)<the_ru>Those are great anyway
(09:53:48)<jomiolto>http://rltiles.sourceforge.net/
(09:53:51)<jomiolto>that's the one, I think
(09:55:28)<jomiolto>http://www.hytti.uku.fi/~jmtoivan/exador/exador000.png <- there's a crappy screenshot of them, but they look much better when there are more things around (items, monsters, etc.)
(09:57:20)<jomiolto>oh, and then there's this: http://rltiles.sourceforge.net/dc-pl.html
(09:57:44)<jomiolto>I somehow found it very interesting to write code that displays the items your PC is wearing :)
(09:57:55)<the_ru>yeah
(09:58:08)<the_ru>paperdolls are great - I wonder why so few use them
(09:58:33)<the_ru>and when they do, they are very poorly implemented (Morrowind comes to mind)
(09:58:46)<jomiolto>hmm, what was the problem with morrowind?
(09:59:12)<the_ru>well, first of all it's buggy
(09:59:18)<the_ru>my arm appears through my shield
(09:59:39)<jomiolto>oh, well, it's 3D and that kind of things are quite common, I think :/
(09:59:47)<the_ru>I found a pair of boots that wouldn't display, so it looks like my legs are cut off right after my knees
(09:59:53)<jomiolto>:D
(09:59:58)<jomiolto>well that's certainly a bug
(10:00:15)<the_ru>the inventory interface is very inconvenient overall, I think
(10:00:24)<jomiolto>well, that's true
(10:01:32)<jomiolto>but making a paperdoll thingy for 2d is surprisingly easy
(10:01:50)<the_ru>... given good graphics to work with :-)
(10:02:15)<jomiolto>uhm, yeah, I was talking mostly about the code :)
(10:02:49)<jomiolto>I don't have one bit of a graphical artist in me, so I can't really get anything done graphics-wise :/
(10:03:26)<jomiolto>although, at one point I was going to make a platformer with stickman graphics, but even that turned out to be quite difficult :)
(10:03:54)<jomiolto>I kind of envy people that can code and do music/graphics
(10:04:26)<jomiolto>but on the other hand, those people are probably even busier than regular developers, so it might no be such a blessing after all ;)

(12:56:21)<TMC>well I wrote a small function today... but I spent 10x longer browsing the web and reading up the page in this channel

(07:23:58)<the_ru>"done"
(07:24:09)<the_ru>I went straight to the endgame

(03:50:01)<the_ru>Hi
(03:54:35)<the_ru>And NT 3.1
(03:55:26)<the_ru>I should check if my WfW 3.11 disks still work
(04:01:23)<Glowie>For porting purposes?
(04:02:23)<the_ru>Nah
(04:02:26)<the_ru>Educational, rather
(04:02:39)<Glowie>Okie
(04:04:32)<the_ru>I tried OS/2 briefly back in 95 or so
(04:05:00)<Glowie>I've never tried it
(04:05:14)<the_ru>I threw it out for exactly the reason that prevented it from becoming popular: it wasn't as fun as Windows
(04:07:58)<Glowie>I don't find operating systems particularly fun, just useful and practical
(04:09:53)<the_ru>Well, a stable, well-engineered, business-like OS still isn't a lot of fun for an 11 year old
(04:10:49)<Glowie>Hehe
(04:16:15)<the_ru>I need new cables for my speakers
(04:16:26)<the_ru>they're slightly too short so they're just stretched over the floor
(04:20:48)<the_ru>I'm tempted to add an overworld to my roguelike
(04:20:56)<the_ru>But I know I shouldn't
(04:21:10)<the_ru>It takes the attention away from the intense dungeon crawling
(04:21:42)<the_ru>I wouldn't be wander-able in the ADOM sense, though
(04:21:55)<the_ru>just a map with interesting locations marked out
(04:21:58)<Glowie>I'd say get the basic fun roguelike finished before thinking of bigger features
(04:22:36)<Glowie>Though I don't know if you've finished that already
(04:24:04)<the_ru>I don't know either
(04:24:28)<the_ru>It just feels like I'm not getting anywhere with it right now
(04:24:41)<the_ru>I don't want to keep writing an engine forever
(04:25:17)<the_ru>and I want a world that somehow makes sense
(04:25:39)<Glowie>I fixed that problem by not writing an engine at all :<
(04:25:47)<the_ru>i.e. not just a dungeon random foo giant, then sixteen flavours of dragon, a million orcs
(04:26:42)<Glowie>Making a logical world just needs planning
(04:27:10)<the_ru>Well, I have ideas
(04:27:28)<the_ru>I was going to make the game centered around world travel
(04:27:38)<the_ru>and each area was going to be a world of its own
(04:27:54)<the_ru>but I don't know how to get it to make sense
(04:29:15)<the_ru>I have plenty of locations that I think could be interesting
(04:29:15)<Glowie>Each area a world of it's own->pick a random scifi cliche like time travel or dimensional travel :b
(04:30:05)<the_ru>temple ruins, haunted mage towers, a sunken city, a desert tomb, a mine, etc
(04:30:17)<the_ru>these could very well just appear in the same world
(04:30:32)<the_ru>I think it would make more sense if they did, actually
(04:30:54)<the_ru>since most planets have a varied climate
(04:31:10)<the_ru>not the scifi stereotypical "the desert planet" "the jungle planet"
(04:31:26)<Glowie>An overworld would definitely work with those ideas
(04:31:42)<Glowie>If you're not afraid of a huge amount of work :P
(04:31:54)<the_ru>I *could* make it one main dungeon, with the others mostly optional
(04:32:13)<the_ru>Or I could have two modes, one where it's just a dungeon hack, and a "story" mode
(04:32:25)<the_ru>the first would just have a huge dungeon with random foes
(04:32:29)<Glowie>Sounds like even more work ^
(04:32:33)<the_ru>aye
(04:32:50)<the_ru>and another problem arises with the overworld
(04:33:11)<the_ru>I wanted it to have a feeling of loneliness; the worlds you were to visit would be dead and deserted
(04:33:22)<Glowie>I'd say if you want to use those ideas while having a world that makes sense, pick overworld instead of one dungeon
(04:33:41)<the_ru>if I have a huge world, there ought to be *someone* alive there that was still friendly
(04:33:51)<Glowie>do they have to be worlds, can't they be locations in a world?
(04:34:10)<the_ru>yes, that's what I'm considering now
(04:34:23)<Glowie>You could write some kind of a post apocalyptic background
(04:34:27)<the_ru>the inter-world travel works technically, but not well thematically
(04:34:39)<Glowie>The adventurer coming from another more lively place etc
(04:35:17)<the_ru>Yes
(04:35:44)<the_ru>The final boss is supposed to be some kind of ancient world-devouring chaos god or something
(04:35:49)<the_ru>wow - that's original
(04:35:55)<Glowie>^_^
(04:36:26)<Glowie>Some of those, like the desert tomb and the chaos god, sound a lot like ADOM
(04:36:36)<the_ru>I just have so many ideas for IMO interesting locations - I'd really like to get them playable
(04:37:08)<the_ru>I love the idea with ADOM, but I've never really gotten along with the implementation :-/
(04:37:38)<the_ru>It's just that "no overworld" was one of my original design goals
(04:38:25)<the_ru>my previous attempt failed for that reason :-/
(04:38:39)<the_ru>but OTOH - I don't think this is very interesting to work on now
(04:38:51)<Glowie>A hint: don't force yourself to add all ideas you have into the game if they simply don't fit. Sometimes you have to make choices and drop other ideas out
(04:39:40)<the_ru>They fit, but not in the same dungeon
(04:39:41)<Glowie>Leads to a more consistent game
(04:40:01)<Glowie>But if one dungeon was one of the ideas, drop it
(04:40:03)<the_ru>I want to have this area called Vault of the Frozen Saint; it's supposed to be a library deep underground
(04:40:20)<the_ru>to protect the books, fire is forbidden
(04:40:27)<Glowie>ADOM has a library too \o/
(04:40:30)<the_ru>so if you bring fire there, the guardians will awaken
(04:40:43)<the_ru>now, how would it make sense to have such an area next to, say, a volcano?
(04:41:04)<Glowie>If it's underground it shouldn't matter
(04:41:40)<the_ru>I suppose a volcano could form under a glacier
(04:41:58)<Glowie>A sleeping volcano at least
(04:43:07)<the_ru>one of the things that always bother me with the major RLs is the complete mismatch of themes
(04:44:35)<the_ru>... I say
(04:44:50)<the_ru>and then I'm actually planning to have a spaceship in mine
(04:45:02)<Glowie>>_<
(04:46:17)<the_ru>How about this - I make the main dungeon large enough to fit the whole game in there
(04:46:38)<the_ru>It's also the starting location
(04:46:44)<Glowie>With the kinda conflicting ideas?
(04:46:54)<the_ru>but if you want extra loot or extra challenge, you can leave and visit other areas
(04:47:18)<the_ru>well, it'd be reduced to only a few branches
(04:48:02)<the_ru>it'd still be large enough to complete the game
(04:48:20)<Glowie>Sure you *could* do that, but to me it feels like you're doing more work than most players can find/use
(04:48:31)<the_ru>but if you're e.g. a mage, you might find it worthwhile to visit the Vault to pick up some books
(04:48:52)<Glowie>Did my sentence make sense?
(04:48:58)<the_ru>Yes
(04:49:34)<the_ru>what if the other areas were unlockable?
(04:49:40)<Glowie>Okie. A working solution, but I can't see why you wouldn't let all players in every game to the overworld locations :P
(04:49:41)<the_ru>you would have to learn about their location in-game
(04:50:31)<the_ru>I'm not hindering them from exploring
(04:50:32)<Glowie>At least it would add that mystery, the feeling that there are secrets to be uncovered
(04:51:20)<the_ru>Or I could go the opposite route
(04:51:32)<the_ru>At the start, there are only a few well-known locations
(04:51:53)<the_ru>You have to clear many minor areas before you learn about the final fortress of doom
(04:52:24)<Glowie>When I add stuff, I try to make it accessible to most players so that I'm not "wasting" effort that only a few players find. But that doesn't lead into mysterious secrets. A matter of preference from thw developers side in my opinion
(04:52:35)<Glowie>Sounds good
(04:53:12)<the_ru>It's also a question of game length
(04:53:31)<the_ru>For an experienced player, a complete ascension shouldn't take more than two hours
(04:53:36)<the_ru>(in my game)
(04:54:23)<Glowie>2 hours!?
(04:54:43)<the_ru>Yeah
(04:54:44)<the_ru>What?
(04:54:54)<the_ru>It's not quite a coffeebreak game
(04:55:08)<Glowie>Then you indeed want to make the locations optional, if you want to add all those ideas that is
(04:55:24)<Glowie>Even mine takes about 4+ hours to finish
(04:55:42)<Glowie>2 is quite short in my opinion for a not coffeebreaker :P
(04:55:57)<the_ru>Well, that's what I intend
(04:56:05)<the_ru>It will probably take longer once it's done
(04:56:16)<the_ru>but I don't have most of the stuff that takes time in other games
(04:56:17)<Glowie>(Though of course normal games take less than 4 hours as you often die before the end)
(04:56:23)<the_ru>no grinding to level up, for example
(04:56:33)<the_ru>just the players skill and luck against the computer
(04:57:09)<Glowie>Is clearing a floor before going down grinding if you indeed go down after exploring the wholer floor?
(04:57:11)<Glowie>-r
(04:57:32)<the_ru>What?
(04:57:55)<the_ru>In my game, you don't get any experience for kills
(04:58:14)<Glowie>I was thinking more generally
(04:58:14)<the_ru>so waiting around for enemies to appear doesn't do anything
(04:58:27)<Glowie>Because only Bands differ from my description
(04:58:48)<the_ru>AFAIK many RLs suffer from a slow mid-game
(04:58:54)<the_ru>gathering the right gear, etc
(04:59:30)<the_ru>when I watch people on NAO they are either a) just starting out, or b) walking around in Gehennom, eating wraiths
(04:59:37)<the_ru>I saw an ascension once, though
(04:59:44)<Glowie>Yeah, but that is very rarely grinding, in Nethack for example it has a lot to do with fountains, well used wishes etc
(04:59:54)<the_ru>Hm
(04:59:58)<the_ru>Maybe Nethack is a bad example
(05:00:06)<the_ru>after all, it doesn't share many traits with normal games
(05:00:30)<Glowie>ADOM has grinding only if you haven't found a ring of ice and need to go to the Tower of Flames
(05:00:56)<Glowie>I'm not a Crawl expert, but at least I haven't had to grind there
(05:01:30)<the_ru>One of the problem with the normal XP systems is that even if you're a skilled player that dive fast, you still have to slow down sometime and "catch up" with your level
(05:01:41)<the_ru>... at least that's my impression
(05:02:51)<Glowie>In Nethack XP levels do actually more harm than the small hp bonus is worth after about 20th level
(05:03:18)<Glowie>I haven't had that impression in any other game than Angband really
(05:03:50)<the_ru>Hm
(05:03:57)<the_ru>What were we talking about originally?
(05:03:58)<Glowie>Unless you're skipping levels and not exploring them fully, which isn't how they are meant to be played
(05:04:08)<Glowie>Can't remember :P
(05:04:20)<Glowie>AFK food for a moment now anyway
(05:04:31)<the_ru>I'm waiting for the same thing
(05:33:57)<the_ru>East coast!
(05:34:08)<the_ru>I'm gonna make an east coast game!
(05:34:13)<the_ru>Most are west coast, it seems
(05:34:30)<the_ru>Just think about it; Baldurs Gate, Betrayal at Krondor, the Belgariad...
(05:34:34)<the_ru>LOTR
(05:34:41)<the_ru>Fallout
(06:04:24)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/MAP_1
(07:01:56)<RotateMe>no topic anymore?
(07:02:23)<the_ru>Hm
(07:02:25)<the_ru>What do you think
(07:02:30)<the_ru>A touch spell
(07:02:39)<the_ru>Should the caster need to have one hand free to use it?
(07:03:03)<RotateMe>nice idea but could anoy the people
(07:03:26)<the_ru>same goes for hurled spells actually
(07:03:27)<RotateMe>if so you should give him the option to make the spell take two turns longer but auto-unequip and reequip the stuff
(07:03:33)<the_ru>where does that fireball materialise?
(07:04:08)<RotateMe>that's right
(07:04:42)<RotateMe>but like i said it doesn't add to the fun because it just makes the spell take longer and needs nasty (un)equiping
(07:05:11)<the_ru>well, what about weapons then
(07:05:29)<RotateMe>what do you mean?
(07:05:42)<the_ru>right now I let the player equip a weapon + shield, a two-handed weapon or dual-wield two weapons, at the same time as having a missile weapon equipped
(07:06:15)<the_ru>making missile weapons equipping both hands is a bit too much, but at least one hand
(07:06:39)<the_ru>that's realistic as well - you can still pull the bowstring even if you have a dagger in your other hand
(07:07:14)<RotateMe>well you most often have some thing on your girdle to put your sword/dagger/etc. away fast to use your hands
(07:07:36)<the_ru>as you said, it doesn't contribute to fun
(07:07:42)<RotateMe>yep
(07:08:19)<the_ru>but somehow I want to prevent people from dual-wielding two battleaxes, having a bow ready in some imaginary third hand AND being able to cast spells at any time
(07:08:31)<RotateMe>if the player wants that kind of deepness, he can imagine that the player puts his stuff away himself while using the spell
(07:09:09)<RotateMe>what advantages do you give when the player dualwields?
(07:09:23)<the_ru>well, two attacks in one turn
(07:09:41)<the_ru>they still take as much time as two individual attacks, but you get to perform them right after each other
(07:09:50)<RotateMe>i did it like that as well but you get a lot of disadvantages
(07:10:00)<RotateMe>for the second attack that is
(07:10:04)<RotateMe>AND you have no shield
(07:10:08)<the_ru>so the two attacks could kill the enemy right away, instead of hitting, getting hit, then hitting again
(07:10:36)<RotateMe>ah but it takes longer?
(07:10:42)<the_ru>yes
(07:10:45)<RotateMe>okay
(07:10:53)<the_ru>it takes twice the time before you can do anything again
(07:10:58)<the_ru>or something like that
(07:11:04)<the_ru>I'm not 100% sure how the math works actually
(07:11:19)<RotateMe>:D
(07:11:42)<the_ru>Also; it does matter what hand each weapon is in
(07:11:53)<the_ru>but there is no way for the player to configure that
(07:11:57)<RotateMe>doesn't he need some sort of skill?
(07:12:15)<RotateMe>in dungeonhunter it's not possible to dualwield without the passive skill
(07:12:22)<the_ru>the weapon that has been in the inventory the shortest time is considered the first
(07:12:26)<the_ru>yes, it needs a skill
(07:12:40)<the_ru>and it gives a -2 to-hit penalty as well
(07:16:32)<RotateMe>okay i think that's fine then
(07:16:39)<RotateMe>don't give any more disadvantages
(07:19:24)<the_ru>well, how about I keep track of the hands?
(07:20:01)<the_ru>when using a one-handed weapon, with or without a shield), there are no modifiers
(07:20:11)<the_ru>two-handed weapons get +1 to-hit
(07:20:24)<the_ru>dual-wielding gives a -2 to the weapon in the non-dominant hand
(07:20:55)<the_ru>it wouldn't keep track of the actual handedness of the character, just where each weapon was
(07:21:50)<the_ru>when using a ranged weapon, it would occupy the non-dominant hand
(07:22:42)<the_ru>or I could let the player hot-key "weapon sets", and spend a turn swapping
(08:04:54)<Aerton>hi there
(08:05:01)<the_ru>Hi
(08:05:18)<Glowie>Hullo
(08:08:32)<Aerton>I can't believe Hajo is back!
(08:08:41)<the_ru>Who's Hajo?
(08:08:49)<Glowie>On RGRD?
(08:08:58)<the_ru>I remember the name but not the person
(08:09:29)<Aerton>the author of H-World
(08:10:02)<Aerton>he didn't post to rgrd for a few years
(08:11:29)<Aerton>too bad my NNTP server begun to skip messages recently :/
(08:24:15)<Kadwiell_>Wow, the screenshot of his latest project looks very nice
(08:24:50)<Glowie>Link it to us too
(08:29:10)<Kadwiell_>http://www.simugraph.com/misc/roguelike_cut2.png
(08:29:42)<Kadwiell_>From the "hommage to the @" thread; I'm not sure it's actually a roguelike
(08:29:45)<Glowie>Neat
(08:29:58)<Kadwiell_>But still, it would be great to have that sort of talent for pixel art :)
(08:30:17)<Glowie>Or any talent for art at all >_<
(08:30:31)<Kadwiell_>Hehe, true
(08:30:49)<Glowie>Though calling it talent is wrong, it's just endless practice like everything else
(08:32:12)<Kadwiell_>Perhaps.. I have no doubt you need a lot of practice to become good, at least
(08:32:22)<the_ru>I'd say mastery is endless practice, talent is just a head start :-)
(08:32:50)<Glowie>My point was that nearly anyone can become good with hard work :)
(08:33:02)<the_ru>yes
(08:33:12)<the_ru>but talent reduces the time
(08:33:15)<Glowie>Usually the so called talent is just more doodling in childhood than for talentless
(08:33:37)<the_ru>well, I doodled in childhood, and I can't draw anything today anyway
(08:33:53)<the_ru>except technical drawings, that I work with, but that doesn't count
(08:34:00)<Kadwiell_>And I distinctly remember people drawing better doodles than me in childhood :)
(08:34:15)<Glowie>Of course you need to constantly keep drawing after that :P
(08:34:20)<Glowie>Hehe
(08:34:43)<the_ru>this is my "art": http://www.hotmotrolf.com/kmfl_big.png
(08:34:52)<the_ru>I didn't make the skulls nor guns though
(08:35:03)<Glowie>I guess there's some differences in engineers' and artists' brains too then
(08:35:12)<the_ru>s/skulls/skull/
(08:36:38)<Kadwiell_>Well, I agree that the "talent" thing is sometimes just an excuse.. not having "talent" doesn't really excuse that I can't draw at _all_ :)
(08:37:28)<Kadwiell_>I don't think I have the patience to try to learn it at the moment, though
(08:37:45)<the_ru>Well, my time is too precious to practice things I don't have any talent for
(08:38:19)<the_ru>I might be able to learn to draw *well*, but I'll never be *great* and I'm not interested in trying
(08:38:48)<the_ru>there are other areas I can excel in
(08:38:55)<the_ru>such as sexual seduction
(08:38:55)<Glowie>Art loses part of its coolness after you realize that those great artist have actually drawn so much that they remember human proportions by heart and it's not magically planted in some people's heads :P
(08:39:32)<the_ru>but you know what
(08:39:41)<the_ru>my GF used to draw a lot when she was younger
(08:39:46)<the_ru>and she was quite good at it, too
(08:39:49)<the_ru>(honestly)
(08:40:03)<the_ru>yet she doesn't draw today, because she thinks it's not good enough
(08:40:39)<Glowie>I've heard of that before, some sort of perfectionism
(08:40:39)<the_ru>to her, every drawing has to be a perfect end product - she doesn't get that she could draw just to improve her skills
(08:40:47)<Kadwiell_>Yeah, I think that stops a lot of people from having artistic hobbies..
(08:41:18)<Glowie>What they miss that they move closer to perfection by drawing those not-perfect pictures
(08:41:23)<the_ru>but then, there are always jealous people too
(08:41:43)<Glowie>Hmm, never thought of it that way
(08:42:05)<the_ru>I know [of - don't know her personally] another girl who used to show he drawings online - there were a lot of people on her page trolling and claiming she didn't draw those herself
(08:42:34)<Kadwiell_>That's a pretty good compliment if she knows that she did, though :)
(08:42:57)<the_ru>Yes, but it isn't fun to hear it every day
(08:43:18)<the_ru>now imagine if all these people with artistic talent were available to the RL community :-)
(08:43:55)<Glowie>I prefer roguelikes in ASCII :P
(08:44:10)<Kadwiell_>That's the thing, though, I don't think all artistic talent (slash skill) is immediately applicable like that
(08:44:56)<Kadwiell_>"Pixel art", making things that look good onscreen, is another sort of medium
(08:46:16)<Kadwiell_>I've seen some tile sets where the art by itself seems very good, but it doesn't fit together very well, so the game ends up looking a bit clumsy
(08:46:40)<the_ru>I prefer ASCII too
(08:46:48)<the_ru>but the other things - homepages, logos, manuals
(08:48:25)<the_ru>we could have guidebooks on par with those of Ultima and other major CRPGs
(08:48:59)<the_ru>Kadwiell_: that's exactly the feeling I get from H-World, actually
(08:49:01)<the_ru>http://h-world.simugraph.com/images/cellars_036.png
(08:49:22)<Kadwiell_>That's a pretty minor point though; Guidebook.txt works fine for NetHack :)
(08:50:24)<Kadwiell_>I'd say there's some of that in that screenshot, but I've seen worse cases..
(08:50:53)<Kadwiell_>And the new screenshot he posted fits very well together, which is why I was impressed by it
(08:58:48)<the_ru>Arcana is a good band for ambient gaming music
(08:58:52)<the_ru>really dark and powerful
(09:00:37)<the_ru>huh
(09:00:46)<the_ru>the RNG is in a strange mood today
(09:00:53)<the_ru>I've found 4 lanterns on level 1
(09:01:03)<the_ru>lanterns are the best light source in the game...
(09:47:44)<the_ru>hm
(09:47:52)<the_ru>how do I filter out blank lines?
(09:48:04)<the_ru>I thought cat|uniq would do it
(09:49:52)<the_ru>grep . <file> worked
(09:50:09)<the_ru>so anyway - my TODO file is 129 lines :-/
(09:50:25)<the_ru>and my IDEAS file is 567 lines
(09:50:55)<the_ru>but there are lots of random whims jotted down in that one
(09:52:37)<the_ru>this one is gonna be a lot of fun
(09:52:40)<the_ru>"What about dualwielding and then polymorphing into a creature that can't dualwield?"
(09:52:43)<the_ru>:-(
(10:01:01)<Glowie>Haha
(10:01:16)<Glowie>Start small, then get back to your ideas :P
(10:45:51)<the_ru>I did start small
(10:46:00)<the_ru>I already have polymorphing and dual-wielding
(10:46:06)<the_ru>but how should they work together?
(10:48:22)<the_ru>BTW, I was just reminded about the probably silliest feature my old RL had
(10:48:34)<the_ru>when moving on the overworld, altitude determined your LOS
(10:48:47)<the_ru>in a thick forest, you could only see the surrounding trees
(10:49:12)<the_ru>if you climbed a mountain, you would see over the trees
(11:58:52)<Kadwiell_>Isn't that pretty reasonable? I can't remember any prominent uses of overworld LOS, though
+++ The date has changed: 2008/04/10 +++
(03:36:07)<the_ru>Kadwiell: I think it's rather silly
(03:36:23)<the_ru>especially since I instead skipped things like magic system
(05:02:34)<oeb>Afternoon fellows
(07:06:11)<the_ru>HELO
(07:09:16)<Aerton>hi
(07:15:11)<tekateru>hello
(07:15:14)<tekateru>anything new?
(07:17:30)<the_ru>the pope is a catholic
(07:21:40)<the_ru>It feels like 1000 lines/.c file is enough
(07:21:52)<the_ru>I wrote a text editor in 1000 lines once
(07:21:58)<the_ru>I thought it was a lot, at the time
(07:23:15)<the_ru>Hm
(07:23:20)<the_ru>All my OS downloads have finished
(07:23:43)<the_ru>MS-DOS 6.22, WfW 3.11, NT 3.1, OS/2 Warp 4
(07:25:17)<the_ru>I'm out of CD-Rs, though
(07:27:08)<the_ru>What do you think of graphical frills?
(07:27:14)<tekateru>frils?
(07:27:17)<tekateru>*ll
(07:27:24)<the_ru>I have blood stains, but they don't contribute to the gameplay
(07:27:38)<tekateru>i meant what are frills
(07:27:41)<tekateru>?
(07:28:02)<the_ru>     3. Hence: Something superfluous, such as an ornament, or an
(07:28:02)<the_ru>        additional function on a device or in a system not
(07:28:02)<the_ru>        essential to the basic operation. -- Commonly used in the
(07:28:02)<the_ru>        phrase no frills, used adjectively to indicate a fully
(07:28:02)<the_ru>        functional but economical device or service; as, an
(07:28:05)<the_ru>        economical no-frills airline.
(07:28:07)<the_ru>        [PJC]
(07:28:36)<tekateru>you mean junk - like bodyparts, or machinery (unusable)...
(07:28:39)<tekateru>depends
(07:28:43)<the_ru>No, not really
(07:29:02)<the_ru>Those are in-game objects that could possibly be used for something
(07:29:15)<the_ru>i.e. my bodyparts can be used to slow down ghouls
(07:29:18)<the_ru>(they eat them)
(07:29:39)<the_ru>I'm talking about things that are purely visual, that the player character isn't aware of
(07:30:14)<tekateru>you should, if you aim for a big rl
(07:30:25)<tekateru>for 10drls and such, you don't need to
(07:30:27)<the_ru>should what?
(07:30:33)<the_ru>remove them? add more?
(07:31:09)<Glowie>Think of bloodstains as effects. Graphical games would be less fun without special effects->effects can add fun
(07:31:47)<the_ru>Yeah, but they also add (unnecessary) code complexity and could confuse the player
(07:31:58)<purestrain>yeah... the only 'nice' thing in my roguelike are the visuals :-)
(07:32:06)<purestrain>blood splatters :P
(07:33:28)<Glowie>If you tell the player what those red #s are, there shouldn't be confusions. But if you feel that it's unnecessary work, leave it
(07:33:37)<the_ru>and what about symbolic representation of items?
(07:34:02)<the_ru>i.e. should all items of the same type have the same symbol?
(07:34:19)<the_ru>or should they use the symbol that most closely resemble the item?
(07:34:25)<Glowie>That would help the player, certainly
(07:34:39)<Glowie>(The first option)
(07:34:49)<the_ru>example: an 'o' with random '/' and '\' strewn about could look like a skeleton
(07:35:09)<the_ru>o is the skull, / and \ are bones
(07:35:27)<the_ru>or should it be just a %, a skeleton item
(07:35:31)<Glowie>Nah, don't try to add graphics to an ASCII game
(07:35:41)<Glowie>%
(07:35:51)<Glowie>ASCII is about symbolism, not graphics
(07:35:52)<the_ru>I'm not, I've used the first approach
(07:36:03)<the_ru>Just trying to get some discussion started :-)
(07:36:24)<Glowie>Okie, and I'm stating my opinion :P
(07:36:25)<the_ru>But OTOH; old RLs often used ASCIIcharacters to represent 
(07:36:32)<the_ru>items
(07:36:44)<Glowie>Which ones?
(07:36:44)<tekateru>i hate hi5
(07:36:50)<Glowie>Rogue didn't
(07:37:02)<the_ru>I've played some version of Rogue that used the "smiley face" (although not really an ASCII character I guess) as the player
(07:37:13)<Glowie>Ah that
(07:37:24)<Glowie>But the smiley is ASCII
(07:37:34)<Glowie>I think o_o
(07:37:39)<Glowie>Not sure
(07:37:52)<the_ru>some use the up-side-down exclamation mark for potions since it supposedly looks more like an actual potion
(07:38:22)<the_ru>I think it's in the non-printable range, actually
(07:38:32)<Glowie>But even then they had the same symbol for all items of that type, that character just represents potion the best
(07:38:37)<the_ru>the face must be an IBM PC invention of some kind
(07:38:42)<Glowie>Yeah was thinking about that
(07:39:45)<the_ru>so where to draw the line?
(07:39:53)<the_ru>I use extended line drawing characters for my walls
(07:40:31)<Glowie>Not necessarily a good idea
(07:40:54)<Glowie>At least I had problems with porting extended characters to for example Russian symbol set
(07:41:36)<the_ru>I think ncurses take care of them automatically
(07:41:43)<the_ru>exchange them for +-|
(07:41:57)<Glowie>Okay
(07:42:18)<the_ru>and what about letters
(07:42:27)<the_ru>should they always be reserved for monsters?
(07:42:40)<the_ru>my 'o' are pillars; a Nethacker would probably see orcs
(07:42:45)<the_ru>or goblins, maybe
(07:42:49)<the_ru>I dunno what exactly
(07:43:34)<Glowie>Veteran roguelikers are familiar with that, I don't see a reason why you would want to throw that away
(07:45:00)<tekateru>i'd like someday to do a weird "tileset" rogue
(07:45:08)<tekateru>@ = #
(07:45:09)<tekateru># = @
(07:45:25)<tekateru>or # = .
(07:45:56)<the_ru>Glowie: but it's against the pragmatical approach
(07:46:08)<the_ru>my pillars work exactly the same way as other walls
(07:46:20)<the_ru>but they are much more visually pleasing
(07:46:41)<the_ru>I used to have levels with different floor colors too
(07:46:45)<the_ru>but I removed those
(07:47:07)<Glowie>Can't 0 for example be a pillar?
(07:47:26)<Glowie>Or just the normal wall tile
(07:47:29)<the_ru>anything could be a pillar I guess
(07:47:35)<Glowie>Hehe
(07:47:42)<the_ru>but it's to give a stronger feeling that it actually is a pillar
(07:47:57)<Glowie>I certainly prefer having all wall-like things the same # for example
(07:47:58)<the_ru>like, the great hall in Moria, for example
(07:48:10)<the_ru>(in the book, not the game)
(07:48:49)<Glowie>Let the player form the image of the hall in his mind, not you with certain symbols on the ugly console :P
(07:49:56)<the_ru>I could add an option that would let the user switch between "graphical" walls and just # for everything
(07:50:23)<the_ru>I'd really like to remove color :-/
(07:50:29)<Glowie>Would work, but it's more work
(07:50:30)<the_ru>a monochrome game, now that would rock
(07:51:02)<the_ru>the problem - I use colors to represent different states of tiles
(07:51:19)<Glowie>Yet you want the symbols to represent their counterparts perfectly, I find that strange :P
(07:51:22)<the_ru>if they are lit, seen with nightvision or just remembered
(07:52:36)<the_ru>how do other games do it?
(07:52:51)<the_ru>AFAIK most just has a "lit" or "dark/not seen" state for tiles
(07:53:02)<the_ru>has/have
(07:53:51)<Glowie>Older games have black (not explored), remembered and seen, where the last two look the same. Many newer ones have gray for remembered but unseen
(07:54:56)<the_ru>I have black for not explored, blue for remembered, green for nightvision and normal color for lit
(07:55:49)<the_ru>I don't see how I could represent three different states with different characters without making the display look horrible :-/
(07:56:19)<Glowie>Don't even consider that :P
(07:56:54)<the_ru>I don't want no stinkin' colors in my game :-O
(07:56:59)<Glowie>I think it's harder to see everything important with a glance if you use only 2 colors
(07:57:48)<Glowie>Plus there are no benefits of having no color. Unless you want to make the game for yourself only, but then you shouldn't be asking opinions :P
(07:58:25)<the_ru>I want to scare away all the gamers that require flashy graphics
(07:58:50)<the_ru>but offer an incredibly deep experience for those that dare to look beyond the interface
(07:59:51)<Kadwiell>If your game offers an incredibly deep experience, it'll probably be hard to represent well in monochrome ASCII
(08:00:02)<the_ru>no, why?
(08:00:08)<Glowie>That's just stupid. Since when was colored ASCII flashy
(08:00:20)<the_ru>there can be descriptive text instead
(08:00:28)<Kadwiell>That's very hard to read at a glance
(08:00:40)<the_ru>more like a RL/IF hybrid
(08:00:52)<Kadwiell>Imagine chess implemented like this: "There's a pawn at b2. There's a pawn at b3. ..."
(08:01:25)<the_ru>well, there's blindfold chess
(08:01:33)<the_ru>and people *do* play that
(08:01:49)<Glowie>Because they don't have a choice :(
(08:01:54)<Kadwiell>There is, but it's pretty hard even for many people who are good at chess
(08:02:04)<Kadwiell>No, I think they do it for enjoyment, actually
(08:02:18)<the_ru>note blind*fold*, not *blind*
(08:02:19)<Glowie>Hmmh, okay
(08:02:52)<Glowie>But still, 2 colors doesn't add to gameplay
(08:03:29)<the_ru>there are advantages, I guess
(08:03:47)<the_ru>like being able to quickly tell which kind of trap you see
(08:04:01)<the_ru>but OTOH, if I have more than 8 types of traps, that breaks anyway
(08:04:07)<Kadwiell>Colouring lit squares and FOV seems like an obvious use
(08:04:11)<Glowie>There are 16 colors
(08:04:32)<the_ru>32 if inversed
(08:04:34)<Glowie>(Though you won't be using black)
(08:04:44)<the_ru>but what about portability, etc
(08:05:07)<the_ru>and how many would bother to memorize 32 different color combinations?
(08:05:42)<Kadwiell>I think NetHack categorizes things into the different colours
(08:05:54)<Kadwiell>So e.g. purple monsters are generally dangerous (demons?)
(08:05:57)<Glowie>16 is 100% portable
(08:06:04)<Glowie>Yeah
(08:06:32)<the_ru>I use purple for uniques :-O
(08:06:36)<Kadwiell>That's easy to remember even if it would be hard to remember "arrow trap is magenta, mana drain trap is light blue"
(08:06:49)<Glowie>You don't memorize them, you just remember after Nth game that blue orcs are harder than green ones
(08:12:08)<the_ru>http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch11s06.html
(08:12:12)<the_ru>an interesting read
(08:15:25)<Kadwiell>Huh, roguelikes are "modelled on either vi or emacs"? Beyond some using the vi keys?
(08:16:07)<the_ru>huh
(08:16:10)<the_ru>where does it say that?
(08:18:47)<Kadwiell>Programs written in this pattern tend to model themselves on either vi(1) or emacs(1) and (obeying the Rule of Least Surprise) use their command sequences for common operations such as getting help or terminating the program. Thus, for example, one can expect one of the commands ‚Äòx‚Äô, ‚Äòq‚Äô, or ‚ÄòC-x C-c‚Äô to terminate a program written to this pattern.
(08:19:11)<Kadwiell>I've yet to save/quit in a roguelike with ":wq" :)
(08:19:54)<the_ru>well, it does say "programs written in this pattern", not "roguelikes"
(08:20:09)<Kadwiell>Well, the pattern is called "the roguelike pattern"
(08:20:54)<the_ru>to me, that sounds rather like the opposite - that other programs are modelled after roguelikes
(08:21:59)<Kadwiell>I know, but as much as I love roguelikes I think vi and emacs are older
(08:22:09)<the_ru>yes
(08:22:18)<the_ru>I think you are correct
(08:22:54)<the_ru>anyway, can't we just assume that by the "roguelike pattern" they mean full-screen programs that use keys for navigation?
(08:23:04)<the_ru>as opposed to programs that just print lines
(08:26:43)<Kadwiell>Yeah, I guess.. they mention mutt and lynx and such
(08:27:41)<purestrain>hmm... is the ps3 now able to play ps2 games via software?
(08:33:06)<the_ru>Anyone up for another discussion? :-)
(08:33:17)<the_ru>About stealth!
(08:34:11)<Kadwiell>purestrain: Yes, for 60GB PAL and 80GB NTSC, according to Wikipedia.
(08:34:24)<Kadwiell>How so, writing a PS2 roguelike?
(08:34:40)<Kadwiell>Stealth is interesting..
(08:35:53)<the_ru>I'm somewhat opposed to the idea of "hide in shadows"
(08:36:14)<the_ru>so I've tried to do it another way; having a Stealth attribute that the enemies roll against to see if they spot you
(08:36:21)<Glowie>My opinion: very hard to create properly in ASCII environment and pretty much no roguelike has done it very well
(08:36:24)<the_ru>it's not working too well
(08:36:54)<Kadwiell>I think one would have to focus on stealth to do it well
(08:37:05)<Glowie>Yup
(08:37:06)<Kadwiell>Ironic that it hasn't been done in a genre inspired by a game called "rogue"
(08:37:12)<Glowie>Hehe
(08:37:18)<the_ru>but how should it work?
(08:37:39)<the_ru>the "hide in shadows" could basically be a spell-like ability that granted almost-invisibility for a limited time
(08:37:53)<Kadwiell>I thought Thief was excellent.. so I'd say like that
(08:37:57)<Glowie>But roguelikes are usually about hack and slash, not sneaking. So I'd just drop that feature and have invisibility where needed
(08:38:04)<Kadwiell>You have to plan your movements and stay in the shadows or out of sight
(08:38:37)<the_ru>But should it be a toggle?
(08:38:57)<the_ru>obviously, attacking someone would break it
(08:39:19)<the_ru>but OTOH, attacking someone when hidden would result in a backstab, if you had that skill
(08:39:28)<Glowie>Attacking or being x tiles from the monster?
(08:39:33)<Kadwiell>There could be a "run" toggle
(08:39:52)<Kadwiell>But I can't think of any other reason for not moving stealthily if you're already in a place where you would be able to hide
(08:40:59)<the_ru>perhaps while hiding, you would have to roll each turn to see if you succeed in staying hidden
(08:41:08)<Glowie>Stealth would need a lot of work to be *fun*
(08:41:19)<the_ru>I'm willing to put a lot of work into it
(08:41:28)<Kadwiell>I had that in Tribe.. percentage chance of "stumbling" whenever you moved
(08:41:29)<Glowie>I don't like mixing randomness and stealth :<
(08:41:45)<the_ru>well, it's the randomness that makes it fun, I guess
(08:41:57)<the_ru>if you're 100% invisible, it's no longer stealth
(08:42:01)<Glowie>It makes it feel too unreliable to me
(08:42:03)<the_ru>but... invisibility
(08:42:16)<Kadwiell>I agree, predictability would be best in a game focused on stealth
(08:42:19)<the_ru>you could always kick a loose rock or something
(08:42:25)<Glowie>You can implement it without being invisible but without randomness
(08:42:53)<the_ru>I don't really see what you have against randomness
(08:43:03)<the_ru>It's like saying I don't want to melee if I'm not guaranteed max damage
(08:43:04)<Kadwiell>Randomness only works if the player is able to plan for being discovered
(08:43:29)<Kadwiell>In a game like Thief, the player is supposed to try _really_ hard not to be discovered, and they're in trouble if they are
(08:43:47)<Glowie>How fun would Thief be with randomness :<
(08:43:58)<Glowie>It's not like melee damage at all
(08:44:06)<the_ru>it doesn't have any randomness at all?
(08:44:14)<the_ru>every guard is in a fixed location?
(08:44:31)<Glowie>Moving detectors != randomness
(08:44:38)<Kadwiell>Well, Thief is a commercial game with designed levels, so yes
(08:44:51)<Kadwiell>But a roguelike would have to have randomness in level generation, of course
(08:44:51)<Glowie>They do patrol, right?
(08:45:04)<Kadwiell>Yeah, but not randomly, I think
(08:45:13)<Glowie>Scripted, yeah
(08:45:32)<the_ru>still - the guards should be *somewhat* predictable
(08:45:40)<Glowie>But even random movement isn't as bad as random chance to be discovered
(08:45:42)<Kadwiell>Yep, studying the guards' patrols is a pretty well-known thieving trope
(08:45:46)<the_ru>i.e. they probably have a fixed patrol route
(08:46:01)<the_ru>Glowie: well, of course there must be a random chance
(08:46:06)<the_ru>how should it otherwise work?
(08:46:17)<Glowie>With a range for example?
(08:46:23)<Glowie>Cross the line and you're seen
(08:46:36)<Glowie>For example 3 tiles from a monster
(08:47:09)<Kadwiell>Stealth games may also want to implement facing, though that _is_ a nightmare in discrete-step ASCII games
(08:47:18)<purestrain>hiding in shadows = trace line from enemy to you and see if it hits a lit wall
(08:47:43)<the_ru>purestrain: that could actually work
(08:47:52)<the_ru>they see the silhouette
(08:47:59)<purestrain>yes
(08:48:14)<purestrain>i compained about the 'stealth' in thief long time ago
(08:48:28)<Glowie>I don't see the use for hiding if you don't specificly create floors with that in mind
(08:48:51)<the_ru>well, there are pillars
(08:49:49)<purestrain>the problem is the bad resolution grid of roguelikes... would be better with non tilebased movement
(08:49:50)<Kadwiell>Your way makes everyone invisible in open terrain, though :)
(08:50:04)<Kadwiell>If I understand it correctly
(08:50:12)<the_ru>quite the opposite
(08:50:16)<purestrain>ah... of course if your tile is lit, you are seen too
(08:50:23)<the_ru>during daytime, at least
(08:50:35)<Kadwiell>Well, daytime would tend to light things, I guess
(08:50:44)<tekateru>laters
(08:50:48)<Kadwiell>That makes more sense, then
(08:50:55)<purestrain>but i would hate staying on a dark tile and everything else is surrouned with light... but noone sees me
(08:51:12)<Kadwiell>That was your problem with stealth in Thief?
(08:51:12)<the_ru>but anyway - don't you think just not stepping on a lit tile is too simple?
(08:51:20)<purestrain>yes, that was my problem
(08:51:29)<the_ru>it should be possible to quickly sneak past even in a lit room - that's where the randomness comes in
(08:51:34)<Kadwiell>Can be very hard if nonlit tiles are scarce
(08:51:45)<Kadwiell>You have to dart through the lit areas when the guards aren't there to see you
(08:51:48)<the_ru>remember, randomness doesn't just make you fail - it sometimes gives you the edge as well
(08:52:05)<Kadwiell>And find the right nonlit tiles to study the guards' patrolling from
(08:52:19)<Kadwiell>But you can't control it, so it's not very fun
(08:52:31)<Kadwiell>Or, sometimes it is fun, I'll agree
(08:52:45)<the_ru>your stealth skills give you the speed and timing to sneak past. but the randomness represents the chance the guard sees a penny on the floor and turns around
(08:53:14)<Kadwiell>But I do think randomness cheapens the stealth game, because the stealth game is about planning
(08:53:28)<the_ru>I just don't see the alternative
(08:53:38)<the_ru>without explicit facing and such things
(08:53:45)<Kadwiell>If there is to be randomness, it should be in naturally unpredictable things like guards' behaviours - suddenly one decides to switch their patrol route around, etc
(08:54:08)<the_ru>just staying in a dark tile automatically granting invisibility doesn't make sense
(08:54:22)<Kadwiell>Well, invisibility as long as they're not _too_ close
(08:54:38)<the_ru>the absolute range doesn't make sense either
(08:54:44)<Kadwiell>And as long as they can't hear your movement
(08:54:56)<the_ru>if you crawl into some corner, of course the guard should be able to walk by just a few feet from you
(08:55:00)<purestrain>'hey, whats that silhouette there?' - 'damn, you should'nt see my, i'm on a black square'
(08:55:55)<Kadwiell>It is a simplification, of course
(08:56:09)<the_ru>but - what about monster stealth?
(08:56:19)<Kadwiell>But "lit" squares and "dark" squares are simplifications anyway
(08:56:21)<the_ru>there's a chance *you* don't notice the guard
(08:56:45)<purestrain>lit and dark squares are simplifications?
(08:56:49)<Kadwiell>Most roguelikes take place in very short ranges, so I think a guard's torch should light all the way to the wall, for the most part
(08:57:12)<Kadwiell>Absolutely lit and absolutely dark squares are
(08:58:31)<the_ru>Well, everything in games are simplifications
(08:58:56)<the_ru>(compared to reality)
(08:58:59)<Kadwiell>True, so we have to try to find the fun ones
(08:59:27)<the_ru>I don't think "stay in the dark squares and you're guaranteed to not be seen" is one of those :-/
(09:00:17)<Kadwiell>I've found that very fun(it's basically the Thief model); I guess our tastes differ
(09:00:49)<the_ru>yes, but the Thief model has an entirely different set of mechanics to deal with it
(09:01:08)<the_ru>what about pen and paper RPGs?
(09:01:17)<Kadwiell>Never played those
(09:01:18)<the_ru>there it's basically just a die roll
(09:01:29)<purestrain>i didn't find the thief model funny
(09:02:19)<the_ru>I only played the Thief demo
(09:02:42)<purestrain>maybe i'm always looking at the programming side instead of actually enjoying the game :-)
(09:03:15)<Kadwiell>I agree that some of the things you're mentioning about it are ridiculous from a "realism" perspective, I just found it fun
(09:03:33)<the_ru>as far as I could tell, it took two things into consideration: line of sight, and loud sounds near enemies
(09:03:55)<the_ru>the difference is that it depends on player reflexes
(09:04:06)<the_ru>in roguelikes those things are abstracted into the players stats
(09:04:06)<Kadwiell>And lighting, and terrain type(for sound)
(09:04:35)<Kadwiell>I didn't rely on reflexes much.. just planning
(09:04:45)<the_ru>yes, but lighting doesn't matter much as long as you stay out of sight
(09:05:07)<the_ru>neither does sound, if you just keep the distance and walk slowly
(09:05:29)<Kadwiell>I hear I played Thief the "slow" way, though, I knew a guy who played it by rushing through the levels and killing everyone
(09:06:05)<the_ru>well, some play quake in god mode
(09:06:09)<the_ru>some people are strange
(09:06:26)<Kadwiell>Playing Thief without stealth sounds like it would be harder, though
(09:06:49)<Kadwiell>But that would allow you to exercise any FPS reflexes you might have :)
(09:06:54)<the_ru>at least on the level I played, getting noticed resulted in a game over
(09:07:14)<Kadwiell>Hm, I don't think that goes for most levels
(09:07:17)<the_ru>the one where you follow two guys through some alleys
(09:07:23)<the_ru>then reached some mansion
(09:07:38)<the_ru>once in the mansion, there wasn't any point in sneaking anymore - you could just kill everyone
(09:07:46)<Kadwiell>On some levels you lose if you kill a guard, though
(09:07:52)<Kadwiell>At least on the highest difficulty level
(09:08:46)<the_ru>anyway, it's an entirely different style of play from roguelikes
(09:09:05)<the_ru>Thief relies on timing
(09:09:22)<Kadwiell>Well, most roguelikes aren't about stealth. Stealth naturally would be about timing
(09:09:30)<Kadwiell>You can do timing in discrete steps..
(09:10:29)<the_ru>I was thinking of keeping the timing in the "hide" action
(09:11:02)<the_ru>when invoked, you're given a few turns where you can move even over lit squares without being seen
(09:11:44)<the_ru>so you use it, run across the room to the first pillar
(09:11:54)<the_ru>the guard turns around to investigate the sound
(09:12:17)<the_ru>you have to wait between the pillar while your "stealt points" are restored
(09:12:45)<the_ru>then, just as the guard is about to turn around the pillar, you punch the "hide" key and run for cover behind the next
(09:13:06)<the_ru>then you throw a rock to the other side of the room to create a diversion
(09:15:06)<the_ru>hiding would also let you perform some actions without breaking it
(09:15:20)<Kadwiell>That might be fun.. giving the stealthy player something to do besides smart movement is a good idea
(09:15:32)<the_ru>you could go into hiding, then run into the lit center of the temple, grab the jewel, then retreat to the shadows before anyone notices
(09:16:05)<the_ru>I have code for sounds drawing attention already
(09:16:21)<the_ru>the question is how enemies should react to them
(09:16:44)<the_ru>it's no fun either if you can just steer anyone away just by throwing some item
(09:17:06)<the_ru>but perhaps that's where scent comes in
(09:17:54)<the_ru>or perhaps being in shadow could reset your stealth points
(09:18:06)<the_ru>when you move out on a lit tile, they are reduced
(09:18:12)<the_ru>when they reach zero, enemies can see you
(09:18:31)<the_ru>so you'd have to plan moving between dark areas, but still be able to move over lit tiles
(09:18:42)<Glowie>Actually I like that idea
(09:18:49)<the_ru>with greater stealth skill, you get more time
(09:19:10)<the_ru>and you can make use of it even if you're not intending to remain hidden all the time
(09:19:18)<Glowie>Exactly
(09:19:42)<the_ru>a room full of goblins? no shadow nearby? just dash past them - chances are you get far enough to reach the door on the other side, and bar it before they catch up
(09:20:17)<Kadwiell>"Intelligent" monsters might not react to simple distractions - this was done e.g. with officers in Commandos, I think
(09:21:45)<the_ru>the stealth points could be reduced by a random amount, depending on your skill
(09:22:05)<the_ru>so planning is most important - but there's always the chance you don't get to the next shadow in time
(09:24:01)<Glowie>As long as it's not too big a factor, randomness. Risks should be possible, put there should be riskless stealth runs too (shorter, obviously)
(09:24:51)<the_ru>well, nothing should be for certain
(09:24:58)<the_ru>but I get your point
(09:25:06)<the_ru>I'm not talking about a 50% risk here; maybe 5%
(09:25:29)<Glowie>Sounds good
(09:27:58)<the_ru>there are a few things to consider, though
(09:28:56)<the_ru>what if you move onto a dark tile, and before your next move another creature moves near, with a light source that lights your tile?
(09:29:23)<the_ru>perhaps the stealth points are restored at the start of each turn?
(09:29:41)<Glowie>That's what I'd do
(09:31:23)<the_ru>I'm trying it
(09:32:43)<the_ru>Should the player see when he runs out of stealth?
(09:32:46)<the_ru>probably
(09:32:56)<the_ru>how would you otherwise know how to time your movement?
(09:33:19)<Glowie>:P
(09:35:15)<the_ru>I think you should see that you're hidden, but not for how long
(09:44:50)<the_ru>hm
(09:44:56)<the_ru>well, it works quite well
(09:48:30)<the_ru>it works damn well, I must say
(09:51:35)<the_ru>Hm
(09:51:47)<the_ru>My GF just came in here
(09:51:58)<the_ru>Kindly asking me not to put banana peels in her computer
(09:53:21)<joe6pack>that's a reasonable request 
(09:53:43)<the_ru>but where should I put them!
(09:53:55)<joe6pack>though i assume she asked you not to put them on her computer rather than in it?
(09:54:03)<the_ru>no, in
(09:54:18)<the_ru>there's an open 5.25" slot in it
(09:55:03)<joe6pack>lost the panel?
(09:57:16)<the_ru>never had it
(09:57:31)<the_ru>it came with a CD-ROM and a CD burner, now there's just a DVD there
(09:57:44)<joe6pack>huh
(09:57:54)<joe6pack>why didn't you leave one of them in?
(09:58:19)<the_ru>I dunno
(09:58:34)<the_ru>I have like a dozes spare CD-ROMs in my closet :-/
(09:58:36)<joe6pack>do one of you guys play diplomacy? 
(09:59:01)<joe6pack>about as useful as floppy drives these days 
(09:59:18)<the_ru>yep
(09:59:21)<joe6pack>i don't think they even sell cd rom drives anymore 
(09:59:35)<joe6pack>it's all dvd's
(09:59:47)<the_ru>If I had a few IDE cards, I could build some kind of CD tower
(10:00:05)<joe6pack>i remember when it was new, i was so excited when i got my 1st cd rom
(10:00:15)<joe6pack>i think it was some kind of encyclopedia 
(10:00:20)<the_ru>... and it looks like USB sticks will replace DVDs for data storage
(10:00:23)<the_ru>if they haven't already
(10:00:33)<joe6pack>i just keep my stuff online
(10:00:54)<the_ru>at least all "business users" I know use sticks these days
(10:01:04)<joe6pack>yes
(10:02:39)<the_ru>hm
(10:02:50)<the_ru>well, this stealth system raises another problem
(10:03:02)<joe6pack>what stealth system?
(10:03:08)<joe6pack>i did one of those once
(10:03:09)<the_ru>what about creatures that don't have any light
(10:03:17)<the_ru>I'm experimenting with a new stealth system
(10:03:22)<the_ru>I have lit and dark tiles
(10:03:28)<joe6pack>ok
(10:03:32)<the_ru>When you move onto a dark tile, you get a number of stealth points
(10:03:39)<the_ru>when you move across lit tiles, these are reduced
(10:03:46)<the_ru>when you run out of them, enemies can see you
(10:03:55)<joe6pack>ok
(10:04:24)<the_ru>it works quite well, but what about enemies that don't have any light?
(10:04:30)<the_ru>you can just run around them indefinitely
(10:05:13)<joe6pack>environment light?
(10:05:29)<the_ru>not a lot of natural light in a dungeon
(10:05:36)<joe6pack>torches on the walls 
(10:05:57)<the_ru>yeah, but what about places where no one is supposed to go?
(10:06:01)<the_ru>tombs and such
(10:06:20)<the_ru>it's not like they keep them lit and cozy in case someone would drop by
(10:06:25)<joe6pack>then i assume creatures that need no light can see in a diffrent way
(10:06:31)<joe6pack>like bats
(10:07:08)<the_ru>well, they can all see without light
(10:07:16)<joe6pack>have detection depend on both vision & sound
(10:07:18)<the_ru>it's just that they don't notice you then
(10:07:32)<joe6pack>why wouldn't they notice you?
(10:07:38)<joe6pack>not notice == not see
(10:07:46)<the_ru>if you aggravate them, they can still follow you into dark areas
(10:08:00)<joe6pack>and then they won't see you?
(10:08:47)<the_ru>they don't notice you until you're on a lit tile and run out of stealth
(10:09:08)<joe6pack>but if you are not in a lit area, and they are not in a lit area
(10:09:10)<the_ru>once they know that you're there, they are able to see you even in darkness
(10:09:19)<joe6pack>than the player can't see them aswell
(10:09:44)<the_ru>I have monster stealth too, but that currently works in another way
(10:09:53)<the_ru>I'm moving from another system to this
(10:10:13)<joe6pack>can these creatures see with out light?
(10:10:22)<joe6pack>like moles and bats?
(10:10:43)<the_ru>the old system doesn't depend entirely on light
(10:11:01)<joe6pack>i am not talking about the system
(10:11:09)<joe6pack>i am talking conceptually 
(10:11:24)<the_ru>the first creature makes a perception roll against the second creatures stealth roll
(10:11:34)<the_ru>if the second creature is on a lit tile, it gets a penalty
(10:11:56)<joe6pack>anyway
(10:12:03)<the_ru>well, I don't understand what you're asking
(10:12:06)<joe6pack>i'm too tired to think about this now
(10:12:16)<the_ru>I suppose bats can "see" in the dark, but I don't see how it matters
(10:12:47)<joe6pack>because then the light based stealth system should be deactivated for them.
(10:13:01)<joe6pack>and should depend only on sound or whatever
(10:13:12)<the_ru>still, that's a special case
(10:13:19)<the_ru>I'm thinking of things like ghouls
(10:13:28)<joe6pack>your problem was with a special case
(10:13:34)<joe6pack>creatures in the dark]
(10:13:34)<the_ru>no
(10:13:43)<the_ru>it's a quite common case
(10:13:58)<joe6pack>if a creatrue is normal and is in absolute darkness he shouldn't notice the player
(10:14:09)<joe6pack>and the player shouldn't notice him either
(10:14:26)<joe6pack>except by sound or something like that
(10:14:33)<joe6pack>but not by vision
(10:14:40)<joe6pack>because it is completely dark
(10:14:49)<the_ru>it's not really absolute darkness
(10:15:04)<joe6pack>but how often will the player actually walk in darkness without a lantern or a tourch?
(10:15:19)<the_ru>if you're playing a stealthy character, pretty much all the time
(10:15:29)<joe6pack>ok
(10:15:31)<the_ru>the only disadvantage is that you can't read
(10:15:35)<the_ru>without proper light
(10:15:39)<joe6pack>then what is the problem again?
(10:15:58)<the_ru>how should creatures detect each other?
(10:16:13)<joe6pack>friendly creatures? 
(10:16:17)<the_ru>no, any creature
(10:16:26)<joe6pack>2 creatures, in the dark?
(10:16:32)<the_ru>yes
(10:16:40)<joe6pack>and they don't make any sound?
(10:16:51)<the_ru>I have a sound system, actually
(10:17:03)<joe6pack>then they don't detect one another 
(10:17:09)<the_ru>you can throw something in a corner and non-aggravated enemies will go investigate it
(10:18:28)<joe6pack>anyway i don't know what your problem is
(10:18:38)<the_ru>me neither, really
(10:18:39)<joe6pack>so i can't really help
(10:19:02)<the_ru>another thing: if I spot a group of enemies
(10:19:04)<the_ru>carrying light
(10:19:13)<joe6pack>*sigh*
(10:19:18)<the_ru>hm
(10:19:20)<the_ru>no, wait
(10:19:21)<the_ru>never mind
(10:19:23)<the_ru>I figured it out
(10:19:40)<joe6pack>i think i understand 
(10:20:10)<joe6pack>you are actually talking to yourself, the typing is a secondary side effect
(10:20:18)<the_ru>probably
(10:20:23)<joe6pack>:)
(10:20:28)<the_ru>once in a while something positive comes out of it
(10:20:38)<joe6pack>there was another swede btw
(10:20:45)<joe6pack>that voted for stockholm 
(10:21:14)<the_ru>I often solve problems just by writing them down; I guess formulating it with words makes my brain approach it from another angle
(10:21:27)<the_ru>I have to decide what's actually the problem
(10:21:33)<joe6pack>yese but why post it here... ;)
(10:22:10)<joe6pack>anyway
(10:22:21)<joe6pack>i am tired :|
(10:22:27)<the_ru>sometimes people help out
(10:22:30)<joe6pack>at least it is friday tomorrow 
(10:22:56)<the_ru>I often get caught in long monologues; sometimes someone has something interesting to add but I'm not really counting on it
(10:22:59)<joe6pack>i didn't mean it, just ignore my rambling. i am spent from all these homework
(10:23:19)<the_ru>besides, there isn't really any conversation here I'm disrupting :-)
(10:23:40)<joe6pack>ok
(10:24:09)<joe6pack>i just thought you are asking something and didn't understand what it is you are asking exactly 
(10:24:13)<joe6pack>but nevermind
(10:24:14)<joe6pack>next subject
(10:24:23)<the_ru>probably
(10:24:25)<the_ru>which is?
(10:24:36)<joe6pack>eehhh
(10:24:45)<the_ru>huh
(10:24:50)<the_ru>what do you want to talk about?
(10:25:08)<joe6pack>i don't know. i haven't had time to work on anything roguelike-y in the recent weeks
(10:25:51)<joe6pack>oh i got an email
(10:26:00)<the_ru>"we don't have to talk about anything specific; we could just *bond*" "so what should one talk about to bond with you?" "I dunno; beer, a nice chick?"
(10:26:00)<joe6pack>Re:Russia
(10:26:00)<joe6pack>So far I have no thoughts pertaining to Russia. What are you thinking?
(10:26:01)<joe6pack>England
(10:26:26)<the_ru>wow
(10:26:35)<the_ru>the whole country of england actually wrote that!?
(10:26:40)<joe6pack>yes
(10:27:01)<joe6pack>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)
(10:27:39)<joe6pack>i think i will tell him about my pact with austria,
(10:28:41)<joe6pack>maybe he could attack russia from Scandinavia while I attack from the black sea and austria from the ukraine 
(10:29:00)<joe6pack>3 way assault 
(10:29:10)<joe6pack>and germany has agreed to stay out of our way
(10:29:27)<the_ru>hm
(10:29:31)<the_ru>how do the turns work?
(10:30:00)<joe6pack>each person submits his moves and they are excusted simultaneously 
(10:30:13)<the_ru>ok
(10:30:20)<the_ru>sounds like it could be fun
(10:31:53)<joe6pack>it is
(10:31:58)<joe6pack>playdiplomacy.com
(10:41:49)<the_ru>how long is a turn?
(10:41:52)<the_ru>a week? a day?
(10:42:03)<joe6pack>you mean in the game world?
(10:42:11)<the_ru>no, in the real world
(10:42:16)<the_ru>how often do you have to issue orders
(10:42:37)<joe6pack>on that website normally once or twice per day
(10:42:42)<joe6pack>more often once per day
(10:42:52)<the_ru>ok
(10:43:09)<joe6pack>but it is originally a board game
(10:43:20)<the_ru>yeah
(10:43:36)<joe6pack>so of course when you play face to face it's less than a day between turns...
(10:43:55)<the_ru>just curious how they solved that online
(10:44:11)<the_ru>since people have different amounts of free time, are in different time zones, etc
(10:44:32)<joe6pack>3yea, you can set it up when you setup a new game

(05:04:39)<the_ru>Hm
(05:04:43)<the_ru>Ah yes
(05:04:46)<the_ru>You were the tracker guy

(05:09:19)<tekateru>i'm angry demoscene died in Romania
(05:10:18)<tekateru>there was a demoparty, in 2000 and 2001...
(05:11:25)<TMCGone>that's not what "no shit" means
(05:11:54)<tekateru>no shit = o rly? here
(05:12:05)<TMCGone>I've never heard it like that
(05:12:34)<tekateru>then what's it meaning?

(05:15:26)<tekateru>the "no shit" in Romania means "o rly?"

(05:17:19)<the_ru>NO SHIT
(05:18:16)<TMCGone>well I can't recognise him when he's like that
(05:18:34)<TMCGone>and I'm wondering "why do we have so many romanians here?"
(10:37:42)<the_ru>work is progressing on my new stealth system
(10:38:17)<the_ru>my biggest problem right now is how to display how much stealth you have left
(10:38:25)<the_ru>if it should be visible at all
(10:39:57)<the_ru>some games have bars that display how much noise you're making
(10:47:42)<joe6pack>i think the player should find out himself
(10:47:48)<joe6pack>it's part of the challenge 
(10:48:11)<the_ru>I think so too
(10:48:20)<the_ru>it's just ~5 turns anyway
(10:49:05)<the_ru>It's hard to tell though, before it reaches a real audience for testing
(10:49:16)<the_ru>I know exactly how the algorithm works, so it's no problem for me...
(10:49:26)<joe6pack>yes i know what you mean
(10:49:43)<joe6pack>but it could always be cahnged later if it turns out it doesn't work too well
(10:49:49)<the_ru>yeah
(10:50:06)<the_ru>right now I highlight the player @ when you're seen
(10:50:18)<the_ru>so you can tell *when* stealth runs out, but not how much you have left
(11:02:03)<Kadwiell>Let me put in a vote for displaying everything - especially if your system is deterministic so that a careful player could just count turns anyway
(11:22:06)<Glowie>I support Kadwiell 100%
+++ The date has changed: 2008/04/12 +++
(08:46:57)<the_ru>I really need to get this into testing ASAP
(08:47:04)<TMC>testing/
(08:47:07)<TMC>?
(08:47:16)<the_ru>uh
(08:47:28)<the_ru>continuing a discussion from 10 hours ago :-)
(08:47:38)<the_ru>I'm working on a new stealth system
(08:48:10)<TMC>I think it heard mentioned
(08:48:31)<TMC>with stealth as a skill instead of an intrinsic?
(08:49:22)<the_ru>no, that would just be a cosmetic change
(08:49:31)<the_ru>I'm changing the way stealth works
(08:49:39)<the_ru>you have a number of stealth points
(08:49:49)<the_ru>when you're on a dark tile, you regain them
(08:50:03)<the_ru>when you're on a lit tile, they are reduced
(08:50:08)<TMC>trippy
(08:50:18)<the_ru>once depleted, enemies can see you
(08:50:47)<the_ru>some actions also cost stealth
(08:51:06)<the_ru>closing doors, for example, will cost stealth *and* attract enemies to the source of the sound
(08:53:08)<the_ru>attacking will always reveal you, but you get a 3x damage bonus on the first strike
(08:58:53)<the_ru>Right now I have a bar displaying how much stealth you have left
(08:59:00)<the_ru>so you can time your movements
(08:59:49)<the_ru>it seems like a sane compromise; even if you can plan exactly how to sneak there's always the chance of an enemy moving or you stepping on a trap
(09:07:27)<TMC>that sounds like a really cool syst3m
(09:08:13)<the_ru>in theory, yes
(09:08:35)<the_ru>I just hope I can implement it in a way that is challenging yet feel natural
(09:09:06)<the_ru>so far, it feels like stealth is much more useful
(09:09:31)<the_ru>it used to be just a roll you made each turn, to see if the enemies saw you
(09:09:34)<the_ru>know it allows planning
(09:09:51)<the_ru>know/now
(09:10:29)<the_ru>the weight of your equipment makes a much bigger difference also
(09:10:54)<the_ru>I just had two good suits of armor to choose from - picked the lighter one since it wouldn't ruin my stealth
(09:11:27)<the_ru>and trap detection is much more useful as well, since they aren't just HP reduction anymore - they make noise
(09:12:16)<the_ru>I'm not 100% sure how to handle ranged weapons though
(09:15:57)<the_ru>It's easy for me, though, since I know how it works
(09:16:07)<the_ru>Maybe it won't be as clear to the average player
(09:16:25)<the_ru>also, I'm testing stealth exclusively now
(09:16:45)<the_ru>I'm not sure how it works togenether with the other approaches you can take
(09:16:59)<the_ru>such as conjuring
(09:17:31)<the_ru>but I guess it would make sense to send your minions forth and then just hang around in the shadows
(11:57:44)<tekateru>hi ido
(12:00:23)<deveah>0irc is complicated and simple at the same time
(12:12:57)<TMCBotting>it is a whole and a part at the same time
(12:57:49)<Aerton>I like the slow depletion of stealth much more than initial random check every turn proposal
(12:58:53)<Aerton>it's more like HP this way - you can't tell exactly how long can you last, but you can have a pretty good estimate
(12:59:15)<Aerton>even if damage has a little bit of randomness
(01:20:06)<deveah>i've got an idea for a rl, "I, zombie" - you wander around killing ppl, and you can update yourself with new hands, eyes, brain etc
(01:26:54)<RotateMe>Aerton, sounds nice, given you don't overcomplicate it
(01:27:14)<RotateMe>there should be a well recognizable bar stating your stealth status when in stealth mode
(01:27:32)<RotateMe>what would lower your stealth? movement etc.?
(01:27:46)<RotateMe>can you gain more stealth by waiting? this would be fun
(01:27:51)<Aerton>it's the_ru who is making a stealth game, not me
(01:28:11)<RotateMe>ah kk
(01:28:28)<RotateMe>sound very well anyway
(01:28:35)<RotateMe>didn't see it in any game as of yet
(01:29:17)<Aerton>I think stealth in RL would face a big obstacle in world representation
(01:29:34)<Aerton>it has to be a lot less abstract than in a RL
(01:30:29)<Aerton>if I see a trash can or a table, I can tell instantly if it is a good cover to hide behind
(01:30:51)<Aerton>should lay prone behind it or if merely sitting down is enough
(01:31:03)<Aerton>from what directions can I still be seen
(01:31:47)<RotateMe>yeah ... if you're implementing stealth like that it's hard to do it with the abstract rl display
(01:32:09)<RotateMe>i don't like it this way anyway, i'm content with a normal stealth mode, where enemies just can't see me
(01:32:23)<RotateMe>whether i hide behind sth just doesn't matter
(01:32:30)<RotateMe>as long as i don't attack etc. i'm invisible
(01:32:55)<RotateMe>the stealth bar sounds like a better implementation than the random check, maybe i'll implement this in DungeonHunter
(01:33:27)<Aerton>if foes just don't notice you, it sounds more like plain invisibility than stealth
(01:33:53)<Aerton>stealth is basically about staying out of sight
(01:34:42)<RotateMe>the difference is that you can be noticed and remain in that state
(01:34:44)<Aerton>be it hiding in some objects, or camouflaging in shadows
(01:35:01)<RotateMe>if you're invisible, enemies who notice you just know where you have been in that moment
(01:35:31)<Aerton>I think in some games, invisibility is broken once you are noticed
(01:35:55)<RotateMe>plus in DungeonHunter stealth is present all the time, you might just walk around unnoticed if your values in stealth are good
(01:36:06)<RotateMe>there's no need to explicitely hide or sth
(01:36:34)<Aerton>I guess you don't call it a stealth game
(01:36:40)<RotateMe>it's not
(01:37:28)<RotateMe>what was this year's 7drl contestant that was all about stealth?
(01:37:50)<RotateMe>had some good ideas but the rl graphic restrictions were very well visible
(01:38:19)<Aerton>hm, I must have missed it
(01:38:25)<RotateMe>it had three or four screens to show how you can hide
(01:38:32)<RotateMe>you could crawl walls etc.
(01:39:07)<Aerton>are you talking about that well-climbing game?
(01:39:49)<Aerton>I could not get it running properly, let alone actually play it
(01:40:58)<RotateMe>yeah that one
(01:41:12)<RotateMe>wasn't that good but like i said, had some good ideas
(01:42:15)<RotateMe>what defines a stealth game anyway? i'd say it's just that there is a way to attack unnoticed, and that you can't kill most enemies using pure melee
(01:49:03)<Aerton>I'd call that a game where stealth is a major element of core game play rather than just an alternative to melee or spells
(02:58:16)<RotateMe>"error: invalid types `field[3][250][250][double ()(double)]' for array subscript"
(02:58:20)<RotateMe>what does it mean?
(02:58:31)<RotateMe>my call is: fields[floor][xp][yp]
(02:58:41)<RotateMe>where floor xp and yp are int's
(02:58:49)<Kadwiell>floor
(02:58:59)<Kadwiell>Does not refer to what you think it does, I think
(02:59:00)<RotateMe>oh dammit
(02:59:04)<RotateMe>okay thanks
(02:59:16)<RotateMe>just added <math.h> that might be the reason ^^
(02:59:37)<Kadwiell>I recall making that mistake with "time" once.. very confusing
(03:00:03)<RotateMe>dammit i use floor about a hundred times in this file :(
(03:01:55)<Kadwiell>Should be quite search&replace-friendly if you don't actually use floor(), though

(06:35:39)<RotateMe>that one's with xvid codec, it looks WAY better...
(06:39:32)<Kadwiell>Wow, looks very neat
(06:39:41)<Kadwiell>Especially the scroll of fire
(06:39:52)<Kadwiell>Your game is entirely realtime?
(06:54:18)<RotateMe>yeah
(06:54:27)<joe6pack>RotateMe: maybe put it on youtube instead
(06:54:32)<RotateMe>could easily be turnbased as for now
(06:54:34)<joe6pack>easier access
(06:54:45)<RotateMe>yeah... wegame.com looks better
(06:54:55)<RotateMe>better quality and speed etc.
(06:54:57)<deveah>yes - my pc is totally screwed up and my video player is.. missing
(06:55:08)<RotateMe>hmm kk i'll do that
(06:57:55)<RotateMe>uploading, i guess it'll take quite some time
(06:59:50)<RotateMe>and you have no progress bar :( i hate youtube

(07:03:52)<RotateMe>here you go
(07:24:02)<Kadwiell>Is the player's speed restricted at all? It looks like that @ moves awfully fast at the moment
(07:40:59)<purestrain>looks almost the same like doryen ?
(07:46:16)<deveah>when will it be downloadable?
(07:46:32)<RotateMe>dunno maybe in a week maybe in two
(07:46:42)<RotateMe>purestrain, it is the doryen engine
(07:47:00)<RotateMe>Kadwiell, it takes 3 frames to move
(07:47:12)<RotateMe>that's just for me to check out the whole map quickly
(07:52:22)<xJabberwocky>pretty cool looking
(07:56:46)<RotateMe>thanks :D
(08:07:29)<RotateMe>i guess the map design will take a lot of time
(08:07:43)<RotateMe>the general layout is predefined but every map looks a little different
(08:08:13)<RotateMe>after that i want to add at least two heroes and 10 skills (5 for each)
(08:08:22)<RotateMe>after that i will do a release
(08:20:06)<RotateMe>gotta go now though

(11:16:15)<deveah>well 0irc is bad
(11:16:22)<deveah>irssi (i hope) is better
(11:16:49)<deveah>it's in consolemode too ;)
(11:25:14)<TMC>hmm
(11:36:20)<deveah>but irssi is uncopy-able
(11:36:37)<deveah>i wonder how it does for the scroller
(11:43:36)<TMC>if it's commandline, then you can copy from it
(11:56:59)<deveah>it's from commandline, but how to copy?
(11:58:40)<deveah>i'm thinking of writing a "Console output vs graphical interface" article on roguebasin
(11:59:45)<deveah>i've been thinking of it
(11:59:58)<deveah>console adds and flaws, gui adds and flaws
(12:00:10)<deveah>opinions for types of roguelikes
(12:00:18)<deveah>classic = console
(12:00:20)<deveah>etc
(12:01:21)<TMC>windows or linux?
(12:11:48)<purestrain>classic = console.... of course everything started with a console, but it's more likely because nothing better was available instead of 'hey, ascii rocks' ;-)
(12:16:55)<purestrain>so i don't understand why everyone is doing roguelikes in ascii or ugly tile look
(12:17:43)<purestrain>imagination is everything, but we are living in the 21st century
(12:20:40)<Glowie>ASCII has loads of benefits, though I don't understand ugly tiles either
(12:21:07)<purestrain>what are the benefits other than 'hey it runs on 20mhz and is playable over telnet' ?
(12:22:30)<Glowie>No need for an artist, easy portability, many veterans prefer it, it's most of the time more informative with a quick glance and if you've gotten used to it, it's not even ugly, but quite pretty, etc.
(12:23:13)<Glowie>Also most probably easier & faster to program->more time for content
(12:24:05)<purestrain>time for content if nomore then 10 people like to play it ;-)
(12:24:35)<Glowie>I honestly think that there are more ASCII roguelikers than graphical roguelikers
(12:25:04)<Glowie>Look at the major ones, they have huge player bases
(12:25:12)<purestrain>don't know, but i think most ascii roguelikers stay on there preferred game
(12:25:24)<purestrain>their
(12:26:26)<Glowie>That wouldn't explain for example DoomRL's 38 000 downloads in one version
(12:27:54)<purestrain>and how much stay playing it? mostly people download it, check it out, and keep it left on hdd
(12:28:08)<purestrain>or would you claim doom-rl has 38000 players? :-)
(12:29:32)<Glowie>Nope, I was speaking of downloads. Even if only 10% played it more than 5 minutes, it's 3800 players in _one version_. Not bad for an underground indie game
(12:30:03)<purestrain>doom-rl has a established franchise... how many doom players just try total conversions and other things?
(12:30:37)<purestrain>of course the same goes for 2d doom shooter, a doom rpg, a doom text adventure
(12:30:48)<purestrain>and a doom pong
(12:31:02)<Glowie>Less, but it proves my point. Make a great game like DoomRL in ASCII and you'll have helluva lot more players than 10
(12:31:28)<Glowie>People play SCII
(12:31:28)<purestrain>make a doomrl with proper graphics and you have got multiple times the players
(12:31:29)<Glowie>A+
(12:32:20)<Glowie>Sure, and Kornel is adding graphics, but that's a lot more work when you get very far with only ASCII. The graphics also have to be really good
(12:34:35)<purestrain>of course its much more work blitting sprites instead of characters ;-)
(12:35:03)<Glowie>I'm not only talking about programming, creating the graphics is work too :)
(12:37:11)<purestrain>nothing comes for free
(12:37:26)<purestrain>new players either
(12:37:59)<Glowie>ASCII is cheap and attracts players, which was what I started proving
(12:38:16)<purestrain>who is attracted by ascii ?
(12:38:30)<purestrain>doom-rl players are attracted by _doom_, not ascii
(12:38:55)<purestrain>doryen players are already existing roguelike players
(12:39:25)<purestrain>egoboo would attract new players to roguelikes
(12:39:48)<Glowie>Veterans are attracted by ASCII, MANY prefer it to graphical. The DoomRL case's point was that people don't ignore games just because they use ASCII graphics
(12:40:32)<purestrain>i didn't say so either; but for non established roguelike themes there is a problem with ascii
(12:40:44)<purestrain>of course i was attracted by 'aliens' in aliens-rl
(12:41:58)<purestrain>and i kept playing it, because i'm a fan of any alien related game... i'm also playing games on c64 and 'ascii art' which are alien themed
(12:42:20)<Glowie>But the ASCII part didn't put you off. Sorry, attract was a bad verb in this case, rather I wanted to say that people don't run away if they hear that the game has ASCII graphics
(12:42:54)<purestrain>they don't run away if their interests are related to anything else in the game
(12:43:50)<TMC>egoboo?
(12:44:22)<Glowie>Not bad? Make an interesting game and ASCII doesn't matter, that's what you just said
(12:46:07)<purestrain>i wouldn't say interesting
(12:47:03)<purestrain>even the most interesting roguelike would not attract any new games if its not based e.g. in a starwars universe
(12:47:05)<Glowie>Aren't gamers' interests related to good and interesting games? ;)
(12:47:49)<Glowie>Sure would, even mine has and it's not based on anything but my imagination
(12:47:51)<TMC>*gamers?
(12:48:16)<Glowie>Yes purestrain meant gamers'
(12:48:21)<Glowie>-'
(12:49:20)<TMC>hi
(12:49:23)<TMC>nice trees, btw
(12:49:24)<RotateMe>hi
(12:49:26)<RotateMe>thanks
(12:49:39)<RotateMe>they took pretty long... looked like shit at first
(12:49:50)<RotateMe>the noise does the trick
(12:50:28)<TMC>ah
(12:50:37)<TMC>pretty huge trees
(12:50:51)<TMC>is that the only other game being made with the doryen engine?
(12:51:13)<RotateMe>as far as i know, yes
(12:51:51)<RotateMe>there's one other guy commenting frequently who seems to be interested in the engine progress but he didn't say anything about a game afaik
(12:53:41)<TMC>I'm kind of puzzled how such a realtime, ascii-graphical game will play
(12:54:18)<TMC>though I suppose, it's just the terrian which looks different?
(12:55:15)<RotateMe>there's more space, that's right, but it works in small dungeons too
(12:56:00)<RotateMe>you have to find solutions for stuff like item usage or ranged combat because the player doesn't have the time to aim or carefully select what to do with an item
(12:57:00)<RotateMe>my solutions for those are auto aiming (and tabbing through enemies) and quickslots for items, where pressing the button does the most intuitive action to the item (equiping, quafing, throwing etc.)
(12:57:02)<purestrain>don't you use some sort of 'pause/freeze' systme ?
(12:57:12)<RotateMe>yes i do
(12:57:22)<RotateMe>you can press space or access any of the menus
(12:57:50)<TMC>would you consider overuse abuse?
(12:58:01)<RotateMe>but it shouldn't be neccassery to use it often
(12:58:10)<RotateMe>no not really
(12:58:11)<TMC>or is the realtime not meant to be a challenge
(12:58:38)<RotateMe>it's not as much about reaction as a jump n run but it's part of the challenge
(01:01:38)<RotateMe>think of warcraft III hero maps in single player where you can pause everytime you want, but you don't because in the end it's not that helpful
(01:02:43)<TMC>don't know wc3...
(01:04:32)<RotateMe>hmmm can you pause in diablo?
(01:04:40)<Glowie>Nope
(01:04:54)<RotateMe>ah, baldur's gate then

(01:50:41)<the_ru>Quite well
(01:50:46)<the_ru>Been in the forest overnight though :-)
(01:51:25)<RotateMe>Oo
(01:51:31)<RotateMe>nature? what's that?
(01:52:46)<TMC>neat
(01:52:56)<TMC>hmm
(01:53:01)<TMC>I must have a tent somewhere...
(01:53:28)<the_ru>We have a cabin :-)
(01:56:11)<the_ru>RotateMe: anyway, you regain stealth in shadow. you lose stealth by un-stealthy actions, such as standing on lit squares, attacking or opening doors
(01:56:58)<RotateMe>that sounds nice
(01:57:15)<RotateMe>is it neccassery to hide behind stuff in order to remain unnoticed?
(01:57:43)<the_ru>hm
(01:57:57)<the_ru>well, you need shadows to keep your stealth up
(01:58:37)<the_ru>if you're good enough you can sneak past directly, but with less stealth you might need to wait behind a pillar or something
(01:59:40)<TMC>is there still a roll involved?
(02:00:10)<the_ru>not in the sneaking itself
(02:00:15)<TMC>how far can you sneak from a dark tile and still be hidden?
(02:00:25)<the_ru>depends on your stealth points
(02:00:32)<the_ru>with 5 points, you can take 5 steps, basically
(02:01:03)<the_ru>speed also affects it - even if your 5 points have been spent, you might be able to get further before the enemies get to move again
(02:02:56)<the_ru>there are indirect rolls also
(02:03:23)<the_ru>for example when closing a door, you roll against your stealth skill to see how much noise you made
(02:03:32)<the_ru>if you closed it carefully, or just slammed it shut
(02:19:10)<TMC>hmm
(02:19:26)<TMC>is it evil to write a state machine using gotos instead of using switch
(02:21:57)<Glowie>Why would you want to do that in the first place
(02:22:43)<TMC>speed
(02:23:16)<Glowie>Faster to type or faster program execution?
(02:23:57)<TMC>my FSM seems to spend at least 15% of its time in the switch and loop statements
(02:24:11)<TMC>I mean, switching and looping
(02:25:06)<Glowie>Are you sure you don't have a bug or something? I don't think goto optimizes it that much, if at all
(02:26:12)<TMC>hmm, it's a surprisingly high amount of time
(02:26:40)<TMC>the 3 lines of code with most time spent in them
(02:28:01)<Glowie>Does your game lag or anything? Perhaps other parts are just faster->more % time used there
(02:29:01)<TMC>what do you mean?
(02:29:12)<TMC>this is a script interpreter
(02:29:28)<TMC>I ran a test script through it with profiling
(02:29:45)<TMC>this FSM looped 160 million times
(02:30:49)<TMC>these 3 lines are only a single jump, a multiply, and some dereferencing
(02:31:48)<Kadwiell>I thought switch and if/goto both compiled into basically equivalent jmps..
(02:31:49)<the_ru>huh
(02:31:56)<the_ru>what language are you working in?
(02:32:12)<the_ru>and what are you switching?
(02:32:14)<TMC>freebasic, which does virtually no optimisation
(02:32:17)<Glowie>Maybe it bugs or they are executed so many times? I meant that a percentual value doesn't tell the absolute value, which means it might not even be a problem even if it takes more time than other parts
(02:32:17)<the_ru>a function call?
(02:32:33)<the_ru>huh
(02:32:36)<Glowie>I thought so too Kadwiell
(02:32:38)<TMC>but can a C compile really optimise a looped switch into gotos?
(02:32:47)<the_ru>it must
(02:32:48)<the_ru>that
(02:33:02)<TMC>no, what I mean is converting this:
(02:33:06)<the_ru>that's the only thing a CPU would understand
(02:33:12)<Glowie>The machine code is only jmps, is it not?
(02:33:58)<the_ru>the machine isn't aware of control structures, those are just defined by the language to make things easier to read
(02:34:01)<TMC>for(;;) { switch (state) {
(02:34:06)<Kadwiell>Freebasic might do something crazy, though.. but it sounds really strange that switch would be a bottleneck
(02:34:20)<the_ru>isn't switch called select in basic?
(02:34:40)<TMC>case STATE_A; foobar; .... state = STATE_B;
(02:34:42)<TMC>etc }
(02:35:07)<TMC>i'm looking at the assembly produced by FB
(02:35:27)<TMC>anyway, can any compiler optimise that, in assembly, into
(02:35:50)<TMC>switch (state) {   // just to find the start state
(02:36:14)<TMC>STATE_A:  foobar; goto STATE_B;
(02:36:24)<TMC>STATE_B: etc... }
(02:36:38)<Kadwiell>Huh, did you remove the outer loop there?
(02:36:43)<TMC>(well, obviously in this case that goto would be totally removed)
(02:37:01)<Glowie>Assembly doesn't have switches
(02:37:10)<Glowie>..I think?
(02:37:11)<TMC>it doesn't have "foobar;" either
(02:37:17)<the_ru>Glowie: no
(02:37:20)<the_ru>it doesn't even have if
(02:37:26)<the_ru>just conditional jumps
(02:37:28)<TMC>ok, I suppose the loop would have to be left in if the swtich could fall out of the bottom
(02:37:34)<Glowie>That's what I thought
(02:38:10)<Glowie>Though the important question is, does your game stutter or lag?
(02:38:16)<TMC>actually, why don't I just test it
(02:38:24)<TMC>not a game
(02:38:27)<TMC>a script interpreter
(02:38:27)<Glowie>If not, no need to optimize
(02:38:32)<Glowie>Ah right
(02:38:35)<TMC>the faster it is, the better
(02:38:36)<the_ru>for example: if (b == 2) would translate to something like (pseudo-assembly): load b into register, reduce register by 2, if register is zero jump to section a, otherwise jump to section b
(02:38:41)<Glowie>True dat
(02:39:06)<TMC>anyway, I'd be surprised if any compiler could do that sort of optimisation
(02:39:08)<Glowie>jnz \o/
(02:39:22)<Kadwiell>This is semantics, though.. "if" is just a syntax for a conditional jump
(02:39:25)<TMC>but maybe they can... it would just have to follow an execution path
(02:39:32)<the_ru>so a switch is really a series of ifs, and ifs are really a series of jumps
(02:39:33)<TMC>actually, I'll just go test it in gcc....
(02:39:46)<TMC>switch optimises to a jump table if that's faster
(02:40:15)<TMC>even FB supports that
(02:40:44)<TMC>(but FB's jump table implementation is realllly slow, not worth it without at least maybe 12 cases)
(02:41:49)<TMC>## SELECT CASE .state
(02:41:49)<TMC>	mov eax, dword ptr [ebp-824]
(02:41:49)<TMC>	mov ecx, dword ptr [eax+8]
(02:41:49)<TMC>	mov dword ptr [ebp-828], ecx
(02:41:56)<TMC>that's the slowest line in the program
(02:42:05)<TMC>doesn't look slow.
(02:42:15)<the_ru>hm
(02:42:26)<Kadwiell>No it doesn't.. are you sure your problem isn't of a more algorithmic nature?
(02:42:31)<TMC>but run 167 million times, it adds up to 0.77s
(02:42:41)<the_ru>well, your time is more valuable than the computers
(02:42:50)<the_ru>just use whatever is easiest to read
(02:42:52)<TMC>yeah, the whole interpreter deserves a rewrite
(02:43:01)<TMC>well
(02:43:04)<the_ru>you shouldn't have to adjust your code to get around compiler shortcomings
(02:43:08)<the_ru>get a better compiler
(02:43:21)<TMC>I'm very willing to spend hours for a 20% speed improvement
(02:43:32)<TMC>ha
(02:43:41)<TMC>rewriting the whole project isn't an option
(02:43:43)<the_ru>how much time is your interpreter using them?
(02:43:47)<the_ru>then
(02:43:52)<the_ru>compared to your whole project
(02:44:06)<TMC>that depends on the specific game being run
(02:44:21)<TMC>faster scripting means more things are possible
(02:44:30)<the_ru>hm
(02:44:46)<TMC>it's pretty slow, you can't reasonably implement a shortest apth algor
(02:44:48)<TMC>*path
(02:45:03)<the_ru>why do such things with scripts then?
(02:45:15)<the_ru>writing an interpreter in an interpreted language feels kind of... I dunno
(02:45:16)<TMC>exactly
(02:45:22)<TMC>FB isn't interpreted
(02:45:52)<TMC>but I plan to add some beautiful array and functional programming features
(02:46:30)<TMC>anyway, all pretty far off topic
(02:46:40)<the_ru>not really
(02:47:05)<the_ru>the problem isn't really that your code is too slow, it's that you're spending time on questionable activities
(02:47:31)<TMC>what, my programmer time? :P
(02:47:40)<Kadwiell>I think it would probably be wise to focus on expressiveness over speed.. if three mov instructions are actually the bottleneck for your code, further optimization seems worthless
(02:47:42)<TMC>*programming
(02:47:52)<the_ru>don't reinvent the wheel - if you need a scripting language, use one that's already available
(02:48:04)<TMC>too late
(02:48:11)<the_ru>why?
(02:48:14)<TMC>although... could add a second language
(02:48:17)<TMC>like python
(02:48:37)<TMC>because this one has been around about 9 years
(02:48:48)<the_ru>... so?
(02:49:00)<TMC>but.. adding a second language sounds fun
(02:51:01)<the_ru>hm
(02:51:14)<the_ru>well, I don't know what you're working on or what you want to make of it, so...
(02:51:44)<the_ru>I just know that programmer time is better spent on writing new code, instead of reimplementing old
(02:52:07)<TMC>(actually... 0.77s on 167M executions of 3 mov instructions on a 1GHz machine is a suspicious figure)
(02:52:40)<TMC>hmm, you're probably right
(02:55:21)<the_ru>and we shouldn't be chasing cycles, either
(02:55:26)<TMC>:(
(02:55:28)<the_ru>at least not on non-realtime platforms
(02:55:40)<the_ru>(IMO)
(02:55:45)<TMC>I'd like a GP2X port
(02:56:16)<TMC>if FB ever supports C output...
(02:56:31)<the_ru>why not just use C?
(02:57:37)<TMC>thinking about it...
(02:57:43)<TMC>rewriting it in C would be fun
(02:58:07)<TMC>uh, the interpreter I mean
(02:58:14)<TMC>no way would I rewrite the whole thing
(05:20:11)<deveah>yay! another post-apocalyptic-like tune!
(05:20:36)<deveah>would sound great in a post-apocaliptyc roguelike

(06:08:51)<deveah>really? a use for my music, finally?
(06:09:30)<TMC>yes
(06:09:32)<deveah>wow
(06:09:34)<TMC>for listening to
(06:09:38)<deveah>0h
(06:09:42)<TMC>heheh
(06:10:10)<deveah>i'd like to make a little arcade roguelike with chip music
(06:10:16)<deveah>it would be a first ^
(06:10:23)<deveah>^^ i meant
(06:10:32)<TMC>neat
(06:10:45)<TMC>actually, I do have a game in which this piece would fit perfectly
(06:10:55)<TMC>unfortunately, it's a game which I never made
(06:29:21)<deveah>funny
(06:30:35)<RotateMe>stumbling over a screenshot of the dragonball game for the ps3 made me realize how much progress i missed concerning 3d games... this is just stunning, whether you like 3d or not doesn't matter
(06:50:49)<deveah>what are the steps of the cellular automaton algorithm?
(06:50:58)<deveah>for caves
(06:51:01)<deveah>1. make raw
(06:51:06)<deveah>2. select cell
(06:51:27)<deveah>3. if not enough walls then put wall
(06:51:35)<deveah>4.repeat x times?
(06:51:35)<deveah>?
(06:58:15)<Glowie>Check from the RogueBasin entry
(06:59:13)<TMC>5. go to bed
(06:59:38)<TMCSleeps>(that one's easy to forget)
(07:08:03)<purestrain>hmm
(07:08:16)<purestrain>all my dungeon generation alogirthm are mainly subdivides for now
(07:08:31)<purestrain>even caves
(07:09:21)<purestrain>the only difference is, that i stop subdividing earlier for some regions and the walls are not straight

(09:16:56)<xJabberwocky>If you're not put off by the idea of an RPG in which every death returns you to the start of the game, Shiren the Wanderer can be a lengthy, satisfying experience.
(09:17:35)<the_ru>Hm
(09:17:41)<the_ru>Well, few of us play roguelikes to win
(09:17:41)<xJabberwocky>it appears like thats the reason for his rating
(09:17:54)<the_ru>winning is just a bonus
(09:18:07)<xJabberwocky>a bonus to the score!
(09:19:09)<the_ru>I don't think many of us play for score either
(09:19:21)<xJabberwocky>    *   Randomization keeps things unpredictable and frustrating  
(09:19:23)<xJabberwocky>    * Not very accessible due to brutal difficulty level and permanent death system  
(09:19:24)<xJabberwocky>    * Tight inventory space and hunger management feel archaic.

(09:54:08)<the_ru>Heh
(09:54:29)<the_ru>Cracow is almost more popular than Berlin now
(09:54:50)<joe6pack>really?
(09:55:00)<joe6pack>should take a look
(09:55:01)<RotateMe>why?
(09:55:19)<joe6pack>i guess because there are a lot of poles 'round here
(09:55:34)<joe6pack>cracaw is actually pretty nice
(09:55:39)<joe6pack>i was there once
(09:55:44)<RotateMe>dammit berlin would've been so easy for me :D
(09:55:50)<the_ru>3 votes for berlin, 1 for cracow, but 2 more that would actually prefer cracow but still have voted for poland
(09:56:02)<the_ru>and for me it wouldn't really matter
(09:56:04)<RotateMe>could you give me the link again?
(09:56:10)<the_ru>http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Rgrd_meeting
(09:56:11)<joe6pack>there are 6 votes to berlin
(09:56:13)<RotateMe>thanks
(09:56:25)<the_ru>joe6pack: yeah, but with reservations
(09:56:50)<RotateMe>well then it's a tie
(09:57:13)<the_ru>not really
(09:57:16)<joe6pack>only 2 of them though
(09:57:25)<the_ru>I think it's more a matter of who is willing to set it up
(09:57:37)<joe6pack>even if they change to cracaw it's still 4 to 3 for berlin
(09:57:50)<joe6pack>4 vs 3 i mean
(09:57:57)<the_ru>yeah, but my vote isn't set in stone
(09:58:12)<joe6pack>well there's time anyway
(09:58:12)<the_ru>I'd rather see Cracow actually, but I think Berlin is more likely to actually happen
(09:58:29)<joe6pack>i don't mind either way
(09:58:30)<the_ru>and it's not really a contest :-)
(09:58:33)<joe6pack>not that much
(09:59:16)<the_ru>it looks like I can get to Cracow and back for 300 euro
(10:00:49)<the_ru>but; is there any one in Berlin or Cracow that's interested in hosting it?
(10:00:58)<the_ru>anyone / any group
(10:03:39)<joe6pack>*sound of crickets chirping*
(10:04:44)<xJabberwocky>*sounds of crickets being stepped on*
(10:14:40)<RotateMe>i don't know what my situation will be at that time but if it works i would host it
(10:15:20)<RotateMe>i will move there in juli so i will be able to tell you by that time

(12:56:21)<oeb>afternoon
(06:13:00)<RotateMe>any hardware geeks here?
(06:13:22)<RotateMe>i have a problem with connecting my laptop to my monitor...
(06:13:34)<the_ru>so what's the problem?
(06:13:35)<RotateMe>when i connect it to the power the same time, the monitor flickers
(06:13:54)<RotateMe>not very strong but pretty annoying after some time
(06:13:59)<the_ru>must be some kind of interference!
(06:14:16)<the_ru>I assume you mean power for the laptop
(06:14:21)<RotateMe>yep
(06:14:25)<the_ru>What if you plug it into another outlet?
(06:14:44)<the_ru>Or move them further apart?
(06:15:03)<RotateMe>didn't help anything
(06:15:17)<the_ru>Hm
(06:15:23)<the_ru>So what kind of monitor is it?
(06:15:43)<the_ru>even LCDs sometimes flicker spontaneously
(06:15:47)<RotateMe>i guess the reason is that both plugs (monitor and power) are very near so the outgoing signal is disturbed by the power connection
(06:15:52)<RotateMe>it is LCD
(06:16:08)<the_ru>ok
(06:16:21)<the_ru>does it work with other computers?
(06:16:31)<RotateMe>at first i didn't know what it was but i tracked it down to the point i can be sure that monitor works fine until i connect the laptop to the power
(06:17:09)<the_ru>:-(
(06:17:34)<the_ru>it could also be that the refresh rate is set too high - that also causes flicker sometimes
(06:17:52)<the_ru>but, laptops often have poor shielding
(06:18:45)<the_ru>the soundcard is pretty much useless in mine - there output's so damn noisy. hum and clicks from the HD, beeps when I move the mouse
(06:19:04)<RotateMe>whoot
(06:19:08)<RotateMe>okay that's worse
(06:19:20)<the_ru>hm
(06:19:21)<RotateMe>yeah but a friend has the same problem only with sound output
(06:19:37)<RotateMe>as long as he connects his laptop to power the sound output is horrible
(06:20:12)<the_ru>I'm not sure if it makes any difference to have grounded outlets
(06:20:28)<the_ru>I only have 2 here :-(
(06:20:33)<the_ru>in the whole apartment
(06:21:36)<RotateMe>afaik the outlets in my room (4) are all grounded
(06:21:45)<RotateMe>i tried most of them an it didn't work though
(06:22:01)<RotateMe>the harder i try to remove the flickering the more enoying it gets
(06:22:28)<the_ru>I suppose you have no DVI?
(06:22:39)<the_ru>though I'm not sure that would actually make any difference
(06:24:51)<RotateMe>i have but i don't think i can plug in my monitor there
(06:24:59)<RotateMe>at least i have no cable for that

(10:51:55)<the_ru>I have a problem with my stealth points
(10:52:24)<the_ru>I want to increase them by two for each turn the player spends on a dark tile
(10:52:57)<the_ru>But; if I perform an action that depletes my stealth points, I should have 0 points the next turn
(10:53:33)<the_ru>If I add two at the beginning of each turn, they player has at least two...
(10:56:08)<Glowie>stealthPoints = -2;
(10:56:10)<Glowie>Fixed
(11:04:42)<the_ru>hm
(11:04:47)<the_ru>yes, it seems to work
(11:05:15)<Glowie>:P
(11:05:18)<the_ru>I thought such a solution would require lots of special cases, but they were only two
(11:05:43)<the_ru>lower the stealth point minimum and make the UI aware that it can be negative

(02:14:02)<Kadwiell>Oops, I gather from the 7drlpc that Tribe was _very_ hard to play
(02:15:06)<Glowie>Those humies were tough in my experience, yeah, but roguelikes tend to be hard :P
(02:16:08)<Kadwiell>I think perhaps I balanced it to be challenging for myself, not realizing that a player generally isn't fully spoiled on all the game mechanics
(02:22:47)<Glowie>I do the same mistake at times, but at least it keeps the game challenging

(04:25:31)<the_ru>how well does it work?
(04:26:23)<Aerton>quite well
(04:26:39)<the_ru>argh
(04:26:49)<the_ru>I need a good name for a global list of levels
(04:27:13)<the_ru>"level" won't do, since I use that as a local variable in many functions already
(04:27:28)<Aerton>Levels?
(04:27:33)<the_ru>yes
(04:27:34)<the_ru>maps
(04:27:50)<Aerton>using captitalisation to denote the difference from local variables
(04:28:36)<the_ru>level = Level[Level[currentLevel]->nextLevel] ?
(04:28:37)<the_ru>:-)
(04:29:23)<Aerton>or make a global singleton Dungeon, and keep Levels and other global stuff in it
(04:29:52)<the_ru>yeah, but I have multiple dungeons...
(04:30:29)<the_ru>I currently have an array of "world" structures, that contain a level[] array
(04:30:53)<the_ru>but I've decided that a single array for all levels would actually be better
(04:31:33)<the_ru>then I wouldn't have to address levels by a world/depth pair, just by index
(04:31:47)<the_ru>and I could let the world code handle level generation but nothing more
(04:33:12)<the_ru>... or I could give the global level array a name like global_level, and provide a get_level(index) function
(04:33:20)<the_ru>that would also do out-of-bounds checking
(06:50:19)<the_ru>oh damn
(06:50:26)<the_ru>I have an overworld :-/
(06:57:19)<the_ru>now; should it be walkable, or just a static map?
(07:01:57)<Aerton>what would be the point of it if you could not walk anywhere from the starting position?
(07:03:55)<the_ru>well, you could travel by pressing a letter
(07:04:05)<the_ru>like a) the tower of DOOM
(07:04:56)<the_ru>I'm taking a slightly different route for this though
(07:05:25)<the_ru>a) you can complete the game without leaving the initial dungeon, b) locations on the map appear only after you learn about them in-game
(07:08:22)<Aerton>if you don't allow exploration without being previously told and travel is not interruptable by random encounters I think selection from a list is better
(07:11:44)<the_ru>yeah
(07:12:18)<the_ru>I'm considering having areas that you would have to walk through, though
(07:12:26)<the_ru>passes, caves
(07:12:47)<the_ru>so you'll zoom to an area map and emerge on the other side
(07:27:56)<the_ru>hm - that would actually be a lot like Zelda 2
(10:06:08)<the_ru>yay
(10:06:12)<the_ru>world design is fun!
+++ The date has changed: 2008/04/16 +++
(07:13:38)<the_ru>I need to define a glossary for my RL
(07:13:40)<the_ru>for the source
(07:14:19)<the_ru>e.g. what is the difference between levels and locations, and how do they relate to the world map?
(07:16:56)<Glowie>Define a glossary for you roguelike then
(07:17:00)<Glowie>your*
(07:17:17)<the_ru>yes, I must
(07:17:38)<the_ru>it felt kind of silly when we did it in the CS classes
(07:17:53)<the_ru>but we weren't talking 40k lines of code then :-/
(07:19:02)<Glowie>Hehe
(07:20:40)<the_ru>I ended up with a huge overworld
(07:20:44)<the_ru>60x80
(07:20:57)<the_ru>three screens tall :-O
(07:21:29)<deveah>hi guys
(07:21:33)<the_ru>hi
(07:21:41)<the_ru>how goes the battle
(07:21:51)<deveah>do any of you know how to calculate the distance between two points (x,y coords)
(07:21:52)<deveah>?
(07:22:17)<Glowie>:o
(07:22:26)<Glowie>Most likely everyone
(07:22:46)<Glowie>Does the name Pythagoras ring a bell?
(07:22:48)<deveah>and will everyone tell me?
(07:22:54)<the_ru>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras
(07:22:57)<the_ru>Probably this guy
(07:22:58)<the_ru>...
(07:23:40)<Glowie>a^2 + b^2 = c^2
(07:23:59)<the_ru>I usually just sum the y and x distance, I'm too lazy to type out the formula for the hypothenuse (!)
(07:24:05)<deveah>i always had a problem -- what is ^ ?
(07:24:20)<Glowie>a^2 = a*a
(07:24:21)<the_ru>exponent
(07:24:24)<the_ru>or what is it called
(07:24:28)<deveah>oh
(07:24:34)<deveah>thanks
(07:24:43)<Glowie>Though some languages use it for sone bit operations
(07:24:53)<Glowie>some*
(07:25:12)<the_ru>some don't have it as an operator at all
(07:25:16)<the_ru>e.g. C
(07:25:56)<Glowie>C++ sure has, were bitwise operators added in C++?
(07:26:10)<the_ru>uh
(07:26:12)<the_ru>well
(07:26:38)<the_ru>I mean, C have a function for it
(07:26:39)<the_ru>pow()
(07:26:48)<the_ru>... has
(07:26:59)<Glowie>Ah you meant the exponent
(07:27:05)<Glowie>Not the bitwise operator.
(07:27:20)<the_ru>What is ^ anyway, xor?
(07:27:23)<Glowie>Yes
(07:29:26)<deveah>so the distance between x1,y1 and x2,y2 is.....
(07:29:46)<deveah>in case you're asking, maths homework
(07:30:21)<Glowie>Oh, I thought programming
(07:30:27)<the_ru>sqrt((x1-x2)^2, (y1-y2)^2)
(07:30:28)<the_ru>I think
(07:30:32)<the_ru>uh
(07:30:34)<the_ru>no wait
(07:30:39)<the_ru>sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)
(07:30:43)<Glowie>Create a triangle of the coordinates and use the formula
(07:30:48)<deveah>sqrt= square root?
(07:30:52)<the_ru>yes
(07:30:56)<Glowie>c=the longest side in the triangle
(07:31:04)<deveah>hypothesis
(07:31:12)<deveah>it opposes the 90 degree angle
(07:31:15)<deveah>:D
(07:31:25)<Glowie>Hypothenuse or something in English
(07:31:29)<the_ru>yes

(07:32:30)<Glowie>nd
(07:32:34)<Glowie>Damn typos today
(07:32:57)<the_ru>Reminds me of a really stupid conversation I had with a friend once. "Barabas?" "I think there should be two b's" "Bbarabas?"
(07:33:56)<Glowie>(Hypothesis is your expectation or guess of the outcome of an experiment)
(07:34:03)<Glowie>Hehe
(07:34:21)<the_ru>I wish they had more discrete math in school
(07:35:22)<Glowie>More calculus <3
(07:35:29)<deveah>i wish biology class wasn't surgeon-skill-needing
(07:36:26)<Glowie>AFK sauna->
(07:36:39)<deveah>you swedish/finn?
(07:37:13)<the_ru>I wonder if I'll ever find use for the trigonometry and derivative we had to learn
(07:37:22)<the_ru>... though by then, I'll probably have forgotten it anyway
(07:39:23)<the_ru>the maths at uni was actually useful though
(07:39:51)<the_ru>logic, probability, number theory, sets, graphs
(07:40:01)<the_ru>just the stuff you need for RL development :-)
(07:40:17)<deveah>well I wish I'll get a job at UbiSoft/BitDefender
(07:40:41)<the_ru>How old are you?
(07:41:42)<deveah>I'm thinking about the future, y'know . . .
(07:42:36)<deveah>:p
(07:43:57)<the_ru>I'm pondering a lockpicking mini-game
(07:44:12)<the_ru>The game generates a series of numbers and you have to guess the pattern
(07:44:29)<deveah>like MAstermind?
(07:44:38)<the_ru>what's that?
(07:45:23)<deveah>you've never heard of Mastermind?
(07:45:38)<the_ru>the name is familiar
(07:45:38)<deveah>it's a codebreaking game with "color codes"
(07:46:36)<deveah>google it
(07:47:25)<the_ru>I am
(07:47:27)<the_ru>hm
(07:47:31)<the_ru>Well, I dunno
(07:47:48)<the_ru>It'd be like
(07:48:27)<the_ru>3 15 35 77 143 ?
(07:48:41)<the_ru>if you get it right, the lock opens
(07:49:12)<the_ru>if you answer wrong or cancel, you get a random chance fbased on your lockpicking skill instead
(07:49:19)<deveah>yes, but with colors, like: red yellow blue white grey grey
(07:50:33)<the_ru>I've never played Mastermind
(07:55:02)<deveah>well I never liked it
(07:55:56)<the_ru>hm hm
(07:56:09)<the_ru>this song goes basically
(07:56:18)<the_ru>FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOUUUU!
(07:56:38)<deveah>lemme guess - football?
(07:56:47)<the_ru>huh
(07:56:50)<the_ru>no, metal
(07:57:47)<deveah>rappaz then?
(07:58:08)<the_ru>?
(07:58:20)<deveah>rappers
(07:58:33)<the_ru>no. metal, I tell you
(07:58:39)<deveah>oh
(07:58:44)<deveah>didn't read that line
(07:58:50)<deveah>sorry, I'm tired
(07:58:57)<the_ru>me too :-/
(07:59:13)<the_ru>I wonder if I should call in sick tomorrow
(07:59:17)<the_ru>I'm not feeling very well
(07:59:23)<the_ru>but I have an important meeting :-(
(08:00:19)<deveah>making ascii logos for roguelikes is tha thing!
(08:00:24)<deveah>anyone want one?
(08:01:22)<the_ru>it's against the pragmatic school of RL design
(08:01:41)<deveah>against?! but I already drew the "I, Zombie" one.....
(08:01:51)<deveah>and I've started the NanoRL one too!
(08:03:11)<Glowie>The_ru, let me guess, Norther?
(08:03:23)<Glowie>Basically 80% of their songs are like that
(08:03:29)<Glowie>And yeah I'm a Finn
(08:03:38)<the_ru>correct
(08:03:54)<the_ru>the song is even called "Fuck You"
(08:04:18)<the_ru>I kind of gave that one away, though
(08:04:20)<Glowie>I pretty much stopped listening to melodic metal when that album came out
(08:04:28)<the_ru>I've mentioned Norther here before
(08:04:37)<Glowie>The album is their worst anway
(08:04:41)<Glowie>Oh
(08:04:46)<deveah>Lordi?
(08:04:50)<the_ru>I like "Everything"
(08:04:50)<Glowie>:(
(08:04:58)<Glowie>Lordi is hard rock, not metal
(08:05:27)<Glowie>Poor you :P
(08:05:32)<deveah>wow! dressed stinking pigs (fugly too)
(08:05:41)<Glowie>I saw Porcupine Tree last summer \o/
(08:06:13)<the_ru>They were kind of cool for the first two songs or so
(08:08:51)<the_ru>I also listen to Nelj√§ Ruusua
(08:09:00)<the_ru>I suspect that's something only I and 14 year old girls do
(08:10:00)<Glowie>At least I don't know anyone who listens to them :b
(08:10:58)<the_ru>Do you know many 14 year old girls?
(08:11:13)<Glowie>Nope
(08:11:56)<the_ru>Me neither
(08:12:06)<deveah>i do \o/
(08:12:25)<the_ru>deveah: so anyway, how old are you?
(08:12:37)<deveah>13
(08:12:48)<the_ru>o_O
(08:13:01)<deveah>what, dodn't you know?
(08:13:05)<deveah>*didn't
(08:13:10)<Glowie>That was my reaction at first too, ru :P
(08:13:18)<the_ru>well that explains a lot
(08:13:24)<Glowie>Amazing English for so such a young lad
(08:13:31)<Glowie>-so
(08:13:49)<deveah>thanks
(08:14:41)<the_ru>well, what's even more amazing is that it's possible to have actual conversations with you
(08:14:51)<Glowie>Haha
(08:15:10)<the_ru>when I was 13, all I did was connect with nicks like MEXICO and behave like an ass in random channels until they kicked me
(08:15:21)<Glowie>Indeed in my experience even most 15-year-olds here are idiots
(08:15:37)<the_ru>hm
(08:15:39)<Glowie>Though I didn't do that
(08:15:40)<the_ru>where are we?
(08:15:43)<the_ru>quakenet?
(08:15:46)<Glowie>Yep
(08:15:59)<purestrain>thats why i hate quakenet
(08:16:11)<purestrain>and why i'm staying in espernet :-)
(08:17:16)<Glowie>Because of people who use nicks like MEXICO?
(08:17:35)<xJabberwocky>espernet?
(08:17:59)<the_ru>are people still obsessed with CS and RS?
(08:18:32)<purestrain>RS ?
(08:18:38)<the_ru>Runescape
(08:18:49)<deveah>well CS here
(08:19:03)<purestrain>don't know runescape... but i was obsessed by CS, but very long time ago
(08:19:05)<xJabberwocky>never played CS, only played RS for a month
(08:19:11)<purestrain>at the beginning
(08:19:33)<Glowie>I played Runescape an hour and no CS at all
(08:19:41)<the_ru>at my highschool, some people used to stay in the computer labs over the weekends just to play RS
(08:19:44)<the_ru>I mean, WTF.
(08:19:50)<xJabberwocky>lol
(08:19:50)<Glowie>Haha :(
(08:19:52)<purestrain>why not?
(08:20:06)<purestrain>i stay the whole weekend at home only for writing code
(08:20:12)<purestrain>and actually writing a game :)
(08:20:24)<Glowie>There are a lot better games out there than Runescape, that's why
(08:20:39)<the_ru>then someone took a dump in an emergency exit stairwell
(08:27:13)<deveah>I'm going to write a tiny rl w/chip music
(08:30:55)<the_ru>I must populate my world
(08:33:03)<deveah>no inspiration
(08:33:20)<deveah>sadly, I must search for it
(08:43:03)<deveah>new version of milkyyyyytrackeeeerrr1!!!!
(08:44:13)<the_ru>I should replay Planescape: Torment
(08:48:29)<the_ru>I need ominous dungeon names
(09:07:33)<deveah>cya tomorrow (i think)
(09:21:04)<purestrain>D really rocks my programming world
(09:21:39)<purestrain>with keyword, mixins, anonymous methods, foreach, getter/setter... everything i missed in c++
(09:29:10)<Kadwiell>Huh, the examples on Wikipedia don't look all that much like C++ - I think I'm too conservative for that :)
(09:31:21)<purestrain>oh, it is very familiar... i could almost copy / paste my c++ sources
(09:31:51)<purestrain>but compared to c++ it is really outstanding :-)
(09:31:57)<Kadwiell>Really? Perhaps just the superficial differences I'm noticing
(09:33:36)<Kadwiell>What do you mean by "getter/setter", anyway? Are they provided automatically?
(09:35:20)<purestrain>no, only syntactic sugar like Vec3d Position() { return position; }
(09:35:20)<purestrain>	Vec3d Position(Vec3d value) { return position = value; }
(09:37:59)<purestrain>the dark side of D are the many compiler bugs :-)
(09:39:24)<Kadwiell>Huh, not sure I understood your example.. can't you do that in C++, though perhaps you'd need an extra "const"?
(09:40:00)<Kadwiell>Compiler bugs, ouch - well, at least that becomes an occasionally-valid excuse for a buggy binary :)
(09:40:18)<purestrain>no; the above syntax allows me for something like: player.Position = .... instead of player.SetPosition(...)
(09:41:50)<Kadwiell>Ah, I see.. I don't think I've ever really felt a need for that
(09:42:08)<Kadwiell>Foreach sounds nice, though. Are there better string classes?
(09:42:32)<purestrain>of course, everything is better but operator overloading
(09:43:21)<purestrain>http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/arrays.html <- have a look at arrays
(09:45:24)<Kadwiell>Transitive "const" sounds nice - const pointers still confuse me in C++
(09:48:01)<purestrain>well, interfaces are not as good too
(09:49:21)<xJabberwocky>looks like it doesnt have dynamic class loading
(09:51:33)<purestrain>yes, it doesn't
(09:52:09)<purestrain>but since its a fully compiled language it would be hard to implenent, don't you think ?
(10:14:30)<the_ru>purestrain: hm, you're not Cuyahogas buddy, right?
(10:14:53)<purestrain>who is cuyahogas ?
(10:15:11)<the_ru>a guy I know that's involved in the development of  D
(10:15:28)<the_ru>he co-authored Learn to Tango with D or whatever it's called
(10:15:44)<purestrain>no, i'm not his buddy
(10:16:10)<the_ru>Ok, just wondering - there was some guy in #roguelike on freenode that knew him
(10:17:41)<joe6pack>there is #roguelike on freenode?
(10:17:47)<the_ru>there was
(10:17:50)<the_ru>it's mostly dead now
(10:18:00)<the_ru>it existed before this channel I believe
(10:18:17)<joe6pack>well that's not difficult, this chan is really new
(10:18:47)<joe6pack>i don't remember when we started it but it couldn't have been more than 2 months or so
(10:19:44)<the_ru>well, at least we had the other channel for a few weeks before you announced this one on RGRD
(10:19:59)<the_ru>and #rln seems deserted as well
(10:22:03)<purestrain>i'm in #rln
(10:22:17)<purestrain>talking with cia-2 :-)
(10:22:50)<purestrain>but he dosn't answer, just keeps telling something about crawl :-(
(10:45:37)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.10-caves.png
(10:45:43)<the_ru>what do you think of my caves?

(06:15:30)<deveah>if it wasn't with the anti-extreme nationalism law, Romanian people would burn down any trace of hungarians

(08:40:17)<the_ru>It was my GF that showed it
(08:40:43)<the_ru>You basically select a number, subtract both digits from it, then look it up in a table
(08:40:50)<the_ru>a table of number - symbol pairs
(08:41:04)<the_ru>when you click a button, the symbol you were thinking of is displayed
(08:41:10)<RotateMe>ah i know that one
(08:41:22)<RotateMe>david copperfield did something similiar on tv
(08:41:33)<RotateMe>i was very young back then and it scared the hell out of me
(08:41:49)<RotateMe>it was the time before he magically moved models to an island and raped them :D
(08:42:28)<the_ru>it's rather simple, actually
(08:42:53)<RotateMe>yeah... his was even simpler
(08:42:55)<the_ru>if x is the final number and y z are the digits that make up the original number
(08:43:05)<the_ru>x = 10y + z - (y + z)
(08:43:12)<RotateMe>^^
(08:43:13)<RotateMe>nice
(08:43:14)<the_ru>we can throw the z's away :-)
(08:43:22)<RotateMe>ah okay
(08:43:27)<the_ru>leaving us with x = 9y
(08:43:40)<the_ru>so whatever number you pick, it's gonna be a multiple of nine
(08:43:53)<the_ru>so they just randomize the symbol that's shown for all multiples of nine
(08:44:48)<RotateMe>a friend used to do a card tricks which i never wanted him to explain because it was so awesome
(08:45:22)<RotateMe>but one time he was too drunk and made a stupid mistake so i saw how he did it and it was a hell of a disappointment
(09:07:02)<the_ru>I'm tweaking my dungeon generator
(09:07:11)<the_ru>I think I found an easier way to remove random walls
(09:13:34)<the_ru>(Thurston and Conway) An angel is stuck on an infinite sheet of graph paper, he can hop from square to adjacent square. Everytime the angel hops, the devil can knock out any square, so the angel can't ever go there. Can the devil trap the angel? What if the graph paper is a positive quadrant (i.e. is bounded on two sides).
(09:13:39)<the_ru>That sounds interesting
(09:20:57)<Kadwiell>No diagonal movement?
(09:21:10)<the_ru>I dunno
(09:21:16)<the_ru>I assumed it was allowed
(09:21:49)<Kadwiell>But Thurston and Conway may not have been familiar with roguelike conventions :)
(09:22:09)<the_ru>:-)
(09:22:46)<the_ru>I guess it gives extra points to calculate both variations, and see if it makes any difference :-)
(09:24:20)<Kadwiell>If there's no diagonal movement, I think the simplified version is very very trivial if you just play it out - e.g. make a knight's move in the same direction as the angel's first move, then move two squares ahead of the angel's next move, then the angel cannot prevent you from completing the diagonal, I think
(09:25:05)<Kadwiell>The game seems a bit like some parts of Go
(09:25:31)<the_ru>Hm
(09:25:39)<the_ru>But as always with mathematics, we need proof :-)
(09:26:09)<Kadwiell>Proof by exhaustion is valid if inelegant :)
(09:26:26)<the_ru>I disagree
(09:26:41)<the_ru>I think one should try to understand the problem at a deeper level
(09:27:02)<the_ru>I think I've removed almost all "exhaustive" algorithms in my code
(09:27:48)<Kadwiell>A noble sentiment, but "proof" has a specific logical meaning, satisfied by exhaustive techniques
(09:28:59)<the_ru>so what would you do, generate a list of all possible moves and counter-moves?
(09:29:00)<Kadwiell>I think this has irritated a few mathematicians, too, though.. if I remember correctly, the four-colour theorem was first proven in part by exhaustion
(09:29:43)<Kadwiell>The tree is very very small for the simplest case (positive quadrant only and no diagonal movement)
(09:29:57)<Kadwiell>Unless I'm misunderstanding some part of the problem
(09:30:15)<the_ru>ah
(09:30:27)<the_ru>well, I was thinking of all quadrants and diagonal movement :-)
(09:31:00)<the_ru>that could make an interesting mini-game in a roguelike, perhaps
(09:31:08)<the_ru>you have to seal the evil monster by outrunning it
(09:31:54)<Kadwiell>Hm, perhaps - does seem quite roguelike-y
(09:32:51)<the_ru>Hm hm
(09:33:01)<the_ru>Do you know the "divide rooms into smaller rooms" algorithm?
(09:33:10)<the_ru>I can't recall who I was discussing it with
(09:35:08)<Kadwiell>That would be splitting large rooms randomly either horizontally or vertically? I think I've used something along those lines
(09:35:14)<the_ru>yes
(09:35:37)<the_ru>I'm trying to create non-rectangular rooms
(09:36:09)<Kadwiell>And not just cheaply, i.e. by making nonrectangular shapes inside distinct rectangles?
(09:36:19)<the_ru>I've previously used an algorithm that selected a random wall and removed it
(09:36:25)<the_ru>So two rooms would be joined
(09:36:30)<the_ru>I'm trying to make it simpler
(09:36:49)<the_ru>What if instead of placing a door between two rooms, I place another tile that breaks the wall
(09:36:54)<the_ru>then I remove all "loose" wall ends
(09:37:28)<Kadwiell>Isn't that basically the same thing as removing a random wall?
(09:37:36)<Kadwiell>Can't see how it would be less complex
(09:37:44)<the_ru>Well, it needs less code
(09:38:02)<the_ru>and it feels like it gives me greater control over how many and which walls are removed
(09:38:16)<Kadwiell>Sounds like a good idea then :)
(09:39:22)<the_ru>what if I just generate rectangles, but flag each tile upon generation
(09:39:39)<the_ru>then pick a random door/wall, remove it
(09:39:54)<the_ru>and "unflag" all tiles in the adjacent rooms by floodfill
(09:40:20)<the_ru>a random door/wall adjacent to a flagged room, that is
(09:40:55)<the_ru>if I let it run to the finish, there ought to be no area on the map that is completely enclosed in walls
(09:43:00)<Kadwiell>Sounds correct.. but you may want a rectangular room now and again
(09:43:08)<Kadwiell>It's a pretty common shape for rooms to have :)
(09:43:18)<the_ru>Yes, but I'll limit the number of floodfills
(09:43:33)<the_ru>Right now I'm experimenting with letting it split rooms until they are 1-2 tiles wide and high, then remove a very high percentage of the doors
(09:44:09)<the_ru>It gives a lot of interesting room shapes, but also lots of 1-2 tile "closets" inbetween
(09:45:50)<the_ru>There are just too many doors
(09:46:07)<Kadwiell>Huh, that sounds like a weird way to use that algorithm
(09:46:17)<Kadwiell>Do you have a screenshot of the shapes you get from that?
(09:46:19)<the_ru>But if I set the door removal probability any higher, I fear I will just create large open spaces
(09:46:24)<the_ru>Wait
(09:47:22)<xJabberwocky>I'm interested to see as well
(09:48:10)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.10-rooms.png
(09:49:14)<the_ru>I really wonder about the sanity of the architect though :-O
(09:50:03)<the_ru>the problem is; the more rooms that merge, the longer the walls get.
(09:50:16)<the_ru>so the more walls I remove, the quicker the rooms get bigger and bigger
(09:50:17)<xJabberwocky>looks almost diablo I ish
(09:50:27)<xJabberwocky>with the closets being the cages
(09:50:36)<Kadwiell>Yeah, that's not bad
(09:51:10)<the_ru>that's with ~75% doors/walls removed, BTW
(09:51:32)<Kadwiell>Very narrow spaces dominate, but that's the norm in corridors anyway
(09:51:51)<the_ru>well
(09:52:00)<the_ru>if they were *corridors* it would be ok
(09:52:15)<Kadwiell>But the L-shaped room on the lower left, for example, is a bit harsh
(09:52:19)<the_ru>perhaps if I'd remove the majority of the door connecting 1-tile wide spaces?
(09:52:35)<the_ru>yes
(09:53:23)<the_ru>perhaps I can tweak it by having different probabilities for y/x
(09:55:01)<the_ru>it's just that when I get to placing the doors, the two rectangles have already been built
(09:55:07)<the_ru>and can contain other rectangles
(09:55:23)<the_ru>so there's no trivial way for me to check which ones are 1-tile corridors
(09:56:37)<the_ru>perhaps if I search the map for floor tiles without neighbours?
(09:56:39)<the_ru>then punch a hole through a random wall?
(09:56:50)<the_ru>that should remove most of the closets, I imagine
(09:57:34)<the_ru>or I could fill them, making them 3x3 sections of wall
(09:58:02)<the_ru>that could result in disjoint areas, though, since the only door connecting two areas could be there
(09:59:47)<Kadwiell>Hm, it seems the Angel is meant to move diagonally
(10:00:04)<the_ru>only?
(10:00:26)<Kadwiell>No, any of the eight directions
(10:00:30)<the_ru>ok
(10:01:46)<Kadwiell>In fact, that's an "1-angel", a general k-angel _jumps_ to some square within a square extending k tiles in every direction
(10:02:01)<Kadwiell>So I don't think I have enough graph paper for this :)
(10:15:17)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.10-newrooms.png
(10:15:17)<the_ru>ok, what do you think
(10:16:52)<Glowie>Reminds me of DoomRL's one generator
(10:17:26)<the_ru>I'm mostly happy with this
(10:17:38)<the_ru>it can create irregular rooms, long corridors and small rooms
(10:17:48)<the_ru>but the rooms are still large enough for one to do something useful in them
(10:19:07)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.10-newrooms2.png
(10:19:26)<the_ru>I like that big room in the lower right that turns into a long corridor
(10:19:33)<the_ru>too bad the corridor doesn't lead anywhere :-O
(10:20:56)<xJabberwocky>lol
(10:21:06)<xJabberwocky>it's a maze!
(10:22:02)<the_ru>and now that I'm taking so many screenshots anyway, here's one of my overworld: http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.10-ow.png
(10:22:06)<the_ru>:-O
(10:23:18)<Glowie>Eek background color
(10:23:39)<the_ru>huh
(10:23:40)<the_ru>no
(10:23:42)<the_ru>it's black
(10:24:00)<the_ru>the ocean... is black
(10:24:02)<Glowie>With those ^
(10:24:18)<the_ru>ah
(10:24:22)<the_ru>yes, it makes it easier to see
(10:24:27)<the_ru>I'm not sure I'll keep it
(10:25:09)<Glowie>I'd prefer it without background, some visible color, but that's just my cents
(10:26:06)<joe6pack>i wouldn't have guessed the black part is water
(10:26:28)<the_ru>displaying it in blue was a bit too intense
(10:26:40)<joe6pack>actually i can't make out muc of anything in that shot
(10:26:50)<joe6pack>i would make the water blue '~'s
(10:26:58)<joe6pack>the ground '.'s
(10:27:09)<joe6pack>and trees a green something else
(10:27:23)<the_ru>it's a mountain range with forests, a lot of ocean, a few passes in the mountains and some snow
(10:27:44)<joe6pack>what is & and what is ^
(10:27:54)<Glowie>ADOM's symbols work very well, why not use those :P
(10:28:13)<Glowie>I'd guess & = forest, ^mountain
(10:28:18)<the_ru>aren't those the ADOM symbols?
(10:28:35)<Glowie>Ocean/water isn't?
(10:28:56)<the_ru>no, but as I said, filling half the screen with blue = is a bit too intense
(10:29:24)<the_ru>BTW, that's just the northern 1/3
(10:29:48)<Kadwiell>The ocean is big and blue in real life, never bothered me :)
(10:30:12)<the_ru>it looks too happy
(10:30:14)<Glowie>Try if blue ~ is better
(10:30:23)<the_ru>is ~ an ASCII symbol?
(10:30:30)<joe6pack>of course :|
(10:30:33)<Kadwiell>Yep, tilde. Seems too good to pass up
(10:30:55)<joe6pack>it is often used in url's
(10:31:01)<Kadwiell>Still, if that's too intense try just blue periods or commas or something
(10:31:03)<the_ru>#126 it seems
(10:31:08)<joe6pack>because of its history in UNIX
(10:31:26)<the_ru>I thought it was among the extended characters :-/
(10:31:49)<the_ru>I need some kind of exploration for the map, though
(10:32:00)<the_ru>"fog of war" or whatever I should call it
(10:32:06)<joe6pack>non of the chars used in urls are in the extended range 
(10:32:42)<joe6pack>or maybe there is... there is somehack to allow unicode in urls
(10:33:14)<joe6pack>but "normal" url's use the first 7bits
(10:33:25)<Glowie>Uhm, nowadays there can be Scandinavian letters in urls as far as I know
(10:33:36)<Glowie>Rare though they may be
(10:33:47)<joe6pack>Glowie: yes, but these are unicode urls, not extended ascii
(10:33:50)<the_ru>not really
(10:34:05)<Glowie>Ah
(10:34:08)<Glowie>Good point.
(10:34:23)<the_ru>As far as I understood it, it's just some application that sits between you and your nameserver that translates them into some x----*.* form
(10:34:39)<Glowie>Could be that too
(10:34:50)<joe6pack>something like that.  i don't know how they do it exactly but it's a hack
(10:34:52)<the_ru>... since DNS itself hasn't changed
(10:36:45)<joe6pack>you can try it in wikipedia. enter some unicode page and follow unicode links. it will look like line noise in the address line
(10:37:12)<joe6pack>the link and the way it looks after you follow it are different 
(10:52:15)<the_ru>ok, I'm satisfied with the rooms
(10:52:43)<the_ru>I've made it remove all 1 or 2-tile closets
(10:58:18)<the_ru>yes, this will have to do for now
(10:59:17)<the_ru>They satisfy my requirements; large, somewhat irregular room that require crowd control or stealth
(10:59:54)<the_ru>tight corridors for strategic retreat
(11:00:04)<the_ru>medium-sized rooms to hide in
(11:37:10)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.10-newrooms3.png

(04:47:27)<deveah>with chipmusic
(04:47:38)<TMC>yay
(04:47:50)<TMC>a 3drl, eh
(04:47:56)<TMC>you're slowing moving up
(04:48:01)<TMC>1 day at a time
(04:48:09)<TMC>actually, that's a neat idea
(04:48:32)<TMC>make a game in 1 day, then 2 days, then 3... and so on up to a year
(04:48:58)<TMC>xchat is neat
(04:49:16)<the_ru>wouldn't that mean spending 364 years or something?
(04:49:46)<TMC>well you could start going up by more than a day
(04:49:55)<TMC>(182 years, btw)
(04:50:24)<TMC>mayb doubling each time
(04:52:19)<TMC>could do 1 2 4 8 16 30 61 91 182 365

(04:56:14)<the_ru>or something
(04:56:14)<the_ru>the original plan was 1 year
(04:59:23)<TMC>I hoped to finish in a year or two
(04:59:27)<TMC>that was 3 years ago
(04:59:32)<TMC>I haven't really started yet
(04:59:52)<TMC>so I could still meet the goal
(05:00:10)<TMC>except I've actually decided not to try again
(05:01:28)<the_ru>why?
(05:05:28)<TMC>because, it's not going anyway
(05:09:20)<Kadwiell>You could settle for nDRLs, that's pretty much my plan
(05:10:02)<Kadwiell>It could probably be made less stressful while still keeping the deadline advantage with something like n = 30

(10:17:37)<the_ru>running in some guys closet
(10:17:52)<the_ru>but it's good enough for me
(10:51:59)<the_ru>I'm out of symbols :-/
(10:54:47)<Kadwiell>Don't you use extended ASCII? You have 256 distinct concepts that need different symbols?
(10:55:12)<the_ru>I just use basic
(10:55:19)<the_ru>Can I rely on the others being portable?
(10:56:12)<the_ru>Hm - does Nethack use just [ for all armor?
(10:56:41)<the_ru>actually there are a few I haven't used yet, but reserve for various purposes
(10:56:53)<the_ru>`%~
(10:57:49)<the_ru>,;
(10:57:52)<the_ru>hm
(10:57:56)<the_ru>no, wait, ; I use already
(10:58:00)<the_ru>not , though
(10:58:53)<the_ru>I don't use {} either
(10:59:10)<the_ru>but I don't like the brackets, I think they're too hard to tell apart
(11:01:20)<Kadwiell>Do you have corpses as something that's not %, or no corpses?
(11:01:55)<the_ru>they are * right now
(11:02:04)<the_ru>I'm not sure what the actual use for corpses will be, though
(11:02:30)<the_ru>and my books are $ now, but I might eventually add gold
(11:02:40)<the_ru>so I'm going to need the $ for that
(11:02:41)<Kadwiell>Didn't you have this stealth component? If so, an obvious "use" for corpses is to get rid of them
(11:03:35)<the_ru>all they are good for now is slowing down hungry monsters
(11:03:55)<the_ru>if you're being chased by a ghoul, there's a chance it will slow down to eat if it comes across a corpse
(11:04:04)<the_ru>but OTOH, they are too heavy to be hauled around for that purpose
(11:04:17)<the_ru>a scroll of blink would be a safer bet anyway :-)
(11:04:21)<Kadwiell>That's great, makes for a nice tactical trick
(11:05:40)<the_ru>it's not very useful
(11:06:26)<the_ru>and I'm not sure under what conditions a monster should eat instead of hunt the player
(11:06:42)<the_ru>I mean, it's easier to eat a corpse than to kill a heavily armed adventurer
(11:06:55)<the_ru>so as long as they have food, they shouldn't hunt
(11:07:11)<the_ru>but what if the player attacks them, then they should at least defend themselves...
(11:08:03)<the_ru>anyway, I'm reluctant to use ` for anything
(11:08:11)<the_ru>can it be easily be told apart from '?
(11:08:29)<the_ru>OTOH, ' are only used for open doors, and always appear within walls
(11:08:45)<the_ru>perhaps I could make `s never have the same color as 's
(11:09:14)<Kadwiell>I think NH uses ` for boulders of all things, but people hate it
(11:10:35)<Kadwiell>It's just too tiny (and also as you say similar to ')
(11:12:59)<the_ru>and it uses O for what, the iron ball?
(11:13:16)<the_ru>I've never understood the meaning of the iron ball
(11:15:34)<the_ru>... but I've never understood much of Nethack anyway
(11:15:42)<Glowie>You get the iron ball from a scroll of punishment
(11:15:43)<the_ru>I guess it's one of those things that makes the game what it is
(11:15:46)<Glowie>Not a good thing
(11:16:43)<the_ru>heh
(11:16:48)<Glowie>Aren't you using [ for all armor?
(11:16:50)<the_ru>and people complain about my cursed items
(11:16:55)<the_ru>no
(11:16:58)<the_ru>[ for body armor
(11:17:01)<the_ru>] for boots
(11:17:07)<the_ru>= rings and gloves
(11:17:12)<the_ru>- helmets
(11:17:13)<Glowie>Wise players don't read unidentified scrolls without a dire need
(11:17:21)<the_ru>" cloaks or amulets
(11:17:31)<the_ru>) ranged weapons
(11:17:35)<Glowie>No wonder you ran out of symbols
(11:18:21)<Glowie>I'd suggest use one symbol for everything similar. Like [ = all pieces of equipment that give armor, so probably not rings and amulets
(11:19:00)<the_ru>I don't have many things that give armor, actually
(11:19:08)<Glowie>That's how the major ones and many smaller ones do it
(11:19:14)<the_ru>most comes from the body/torso slot
(11:19:21)<the_ru>a small part comes from the helmet
(11:19:31)<Glowie>Body armor, gloves, helmets and boots don't?
(11:19:45)<Glowie>And cloaks
(11:20:04)<the_ru>boots, gloves and cloaks mostly give other benefits
(11:20:12)<the_ru>such as resistances, stealth
(11:20:22)<the_ru>padded boots, wool cloak for example
(11:20:53)<Glowie>Boots and gloves do also protect, some cloaks too
(11:21:37)<xJabberwocky>you also have different colors to use
(11:22:06)<Glowie>Yup
(11:22:12)<the_ru>Glowie: not in my game :-O
(11:22:23)<the_ru>xJabberwocky: actually, I'd go completely without color if it was possible
(11:22:27)<Glowie>I meant reality
(11:22:37)<the_ru>but I have too much information to display
(11:23:03)<Glowie>Iron boots and gauntlets don't protect?
(11:23:35)<the_ru>I have leather boots, that give +1 max HP
(11:24:16)<Glowie>So you could have iron boots that give +3
(11:24:39)<the_ru>I get your point, but in my game the main purpose of boots isn't to provide protection
(11:24:47)<Glowie>Okay
(11:24:58)<the_ru>that's why I have different symbols for them
(11:25:14)<the_ru>it shouldn't be just "oh, more armor numbers to add to my stats"
(11:25:33)<Glowie>No one would complain even if all wearable non magical non weapon items were [
(11:25:48)<Glowie>You just have to make it clear elsewhere
(11:26:08)<Glowie>But sure you can keep it that way if you have enough symbols
(11:26:39)<the_ru>well, if we're talking realism
(11:26:49)<the_ru>the player should be allowed to wear ten rings
(11:26:56)<the_ru>or even more
(11:27:07)<Kadwiell>If we're talking realism, rings should just be decorative
(11:27:18)<Glowie>Hehe
(11:27:23)<Glowie>Kadwiell strikes
(11:27:43)<the_ru>so there could be gauntlets that protected against getting fingers chopped off
(11:27:43)<Glowie>But you can just say that their immense power prevents using more than 2
(11:28:12)<the_ru>nah
(11:28:19)<the_ru>they're gonna need all the help they can get...
(11:28:43)<Glowie>But then they don't need to make a choice which ones to use
(11:29:20)<Kadwiell>You could make rings give very minor and cumulative effects
(11:29:28)<Glowie>Ah well I'm off now, good luck with the planning :)
(11:29:34)<Glowie>That would work too
(11:29:37)<Glowie>G'night
(11:29:47)<the_ru>or I could just make rings very rare
(11:30:03)<Kadwiell>The only real problem is that adventurers wearing rings universally wearing rings on every finger is a pretty ridiculous mental image
(11:30:17)<Kadwiell>You just know someone will collect ten, though :)
(11:30:35)<the_ru>so I'll add a timer
(11:30:39)<the_ru>a plague
(11:30:48)<the_ru>finish the game in two weeks, or DIE.
(11:31:21)<Kadwiell>Hehe
(11:31:43)<Kadwiell>Might be reasonable, but I wouldn't add it if the only reason you need it is to prevent players from wearing too many rings
(11:32:43)<the_ru>I could give them an accuracy penalty, since having too many rings would make it hard to hold weapons properly
(11:33:09)<the_ru>and perform tasks like lockpicking 
(11:34:48)<Kadwiell>Heh, is that an actual problem for people who like to wear a lot of rings?
(11:35:06)<the_ru>I dunno
(11:35:57)<the_ru>or how about I have a "bling" attribute that is increased by jewelry - if you wear enough you will be constantly harassed by robbers
(11:38:18)<Kadwiell>Players would probably kill the robbers with the awesome powers of their jewelry and then take _their_ rings
(11:38:55)<Kadwiell>Seriously, this seems like a complicated solution for a problem that's not very significant
(11:40:59)<the_ru>I don't really consider it a problem
(11:41:17)<the_ru>the really powerful rings come with penalties as well
(11:44:31)<the_ru>I'm experimenting with a way to display less information
(11:45:04)<the_ru>if I just display unseen floors as black it gets a bit hard to tell where a room begins and ends
(11:46:09)<the_ru>and it gets hard to tell which rooms have been completely explored
(11:47:36)<the_ru>but OTOH, does the player need to know that...
(11:55:14)<the_ru>BUT
(11:55:16)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.10-black.png
+++ The date has changed: 2008/04/19 +++
(10:26:47)<the_ru>rings could also be a finite resource
(10:27:39)<the_ru>they have a charge that is reduced when you wear it
(10:27:52)<the_ru>so if you want to burn ten rings just to have one on each finger, it's your choice.
(10:28:34)<the_ru>and such treasure ought to be very hard to create, so by the time you learn to recharge them, you're so powerful you no longer need rings
(10:45:19)<TMC>what fun is creating things if they do you no good?
(10:46:36)<the_ru>well, I was thinking "but then you can just recharge them!"
(10:47:01)<the_ru>but by the time you learn a "recharge ring" spell you should be powerful enough not to need to depend on rings anyway
(10:47:39)<the_ru>e.g. you have a "ring of protection" that gives a minor bonus to something
(10:47:54)<the_ru>but at the same time you have a protection spell that gives much better results
(10:50:45)<TMC>but you could use both at once, couldn't you?
(10:50:54)<the_ru>yes, of course
(10:51:00)<TMC>wouldn't that be worthwhile
(10:51:14)<the_ru>but in the long run, it's cheaper to just use the spell than keep recharging the ring
(10:51:43)<TMC>well, if you're twinking your character...
(10:52:05)<the_ru>a powerful magician would probably consider such an item merely a curious trinket at best :-)
(12:21:15)<deveah>the mario thingie is freakin awesome!
(12:21:21)<the_ru>?
(12:21:39)<deveah>from the topic
(12:34:57)<TMC>ye
(12:35:31)<TMC>though I think I prefer the rollerskater
(01:37:23)<deveah|afk>brb
(02:30:18)<the_ru>Hm
(02:30:25)<the_ru>Does ADOM have persistent levels?
(02:32:21)<Glowie>Yep
(02:32:29)<Glowie>In all but one dungeon
(02:32:39)<the_ru>Ok
(02:32:42)<Glowie>"The endless" dungeon
(02:33:41)<the_ru>ID?
(02:33:53)<Glowie>Yep
(02:34:10)<Glowie>Infinite dungeon*
(02:34:51)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.10-black2.png
(02:35:18)<the_ru>I'm experimenting with a new visual style
(02:36:04)<Glowie>The exact space is harder to see without . as floorÔøΩ
(02:36:08)<Glowie>-ÔøΩ
(02:36:39)<the_ru>yes
(02:36:41)<TMC>that looks pretty neat
(02:36:45)<the_ru>but I don't think it's needed, really
(02:36:59)<the_ru>. are displayed for lit squares
(02:37:23)<TMC>so one of those monsters has a light?
(02:37:33)<TMC>that's extended ascii, right
(02:37:35)<the_ru>yes, the goblins
(02:37:43)<TMC>is that dangerous to portability?
(02:37:48)<the_ru>somewhat
(02:37:59)<the_ru>ncurses translates the crosses to +
(02:38:15)<TMC>for no reason?
(02:38:26)<the_ru>when the extended characters aren't available
(02:38:54)<the_ru>and the lines become regular - and |
(02:38:57)<the_ru>so it looks worse
(02:39:15)<TMC>well I suppose that's not so bad
(02:39:15)<the_ru>the + could be mistaken for doors, the - could be mistaken for helmets
(02:39:23)<the_ru>but otherwise everything should work
(02:39:26)<TMC>but other extended ascii would be
(02:39:51)<TMC>under what conditions is the extended ascii codepage non available/different? any idea?
(02:39:58)<the_ru>no
(02:40:14)<the_ru>this works in xterm and putty, beyond that I don't really care
(02:41:05)<TMC>then how do you know what ncurses translates things to? reading off a table?
(02:43:45)<the_ru>yes
(02:43:46)<the_ru>http://linux.die.net/man/3/addch
(02:44:20)<the_ru>BRB laundry
(02:48:44)<the_ru>I think most people will give a "WTF" reaction to this
(02:50:58)<TMC>not if they've played nethack
(02:51:27)<the_ru>nethack has a slightly different style
(02:51:46)<the_ru>I don't have explicit corridor tiles nor permalit rooms
(02:51:51)<the_ru>... I used to have them though
(02:52:31)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pics/tsl-0.2-003.png
(02:53:25)<the_ru>and then there will be objections to the lack of color
(02:53:57)<the_ru>though for some reason, the people that complain the loudest tend to be those that haven't even *played* the game ;-)
(02:55:02)<Glowie>I complain about the lack of color because there's really no benefit in not using it :<
(02:56:31)<TMC>You are caught in the ru
(02:57:33)<TMC>now hang on a minute
(02:57:42)<the_ru>Glowie: there is
(02:57:54)<TMC>that looks an awfully lot like a separate corridor tile to me
(02:58:15)<the_ru>it requires me too simplify the interface
(02:58:25)<the_ru>which leads to an alternative visual style
(02:58:51)<the_ru>as you can see, I've pretty much tried to mimic Nethack, Crawl and ADOM, but none really fit my requirements
(02:59:01)<the_ru>TMC: it is
(02:59:07)<the_ru>that was the point of showing that picture :-O
(03:01:05)<Glowie>Alternative visual style that pleases only very few :<
(03:01:25)<Glowie>I wouldn't sacrifice clearness to get a different visual style
(03:01:38)<the_ru>I think this is clearer
(03:01:52)<the_ru>it isn't as cluttered as having . everywhere, with multiple colors
(03:02:25)<Glowie>Noticing for example items that have different color than the walls around it is A LOT clearer than with 2 colors
(03:04:01)<the_ru>so how many items do we need?
(03:04:12)<the_ru>right now it's slightly too much
(03:04:42)<the_ru>the player shouldn't have to sift through them
(03:05:51)<the_ru>and actually, this game is mostly influenced by a non-roguelike
(03:05:53)<the_ru>http://www.mobygames.com/game/wizards-castle
(03:08:31)<the_ru>I'd like to capture the feeling of that game, but in a roguelike
(03:08:44)<the_ru>and of course with many more options
(03:09:00)<Glowie>Haven't played that
(03:09:04)<Glowie>Is it an IF?
(03:09:30)<the_ru>not quite
(03:10:01)<the_ru>It looks like one but the command input is mostly single letters
(03:10:14)<Glowie>Okay
(03:10:23)<the_ru>and it's just about combat, not problem solving
(03:17:09)<TMC>the_ru> I don't have explicit corridor tiles nor permalit rooms
(03:17:11)<TMC>I'm confused
(03:18:18)<the_ru>TMC: that's from 0.2 - I'm at 0.10 now
(03:18:24)<TMC>ah, ok
(03:19:12)<TMC>if you have that many items, how about adding a search option to the inventory :P
(04:28:03)<the_ru>excellent
(04:29:53)<the_ru>9V, 0.5A
(04:29:59)<the_ru>just what my stompboxes need
(04:31:08)<the_ru>they sound a lot better with a reliable power source
(04:34:05)<jraregris>you swapped the polarity?
(04:34:09)<the_ru>yes
(04:34:29)<jraregris>they were initially wrong?
(04:34:33)<the_ru>they were +(-, I wanted +)-
(04:34:43)<the_ru>or the reverse, I don't recall exactly
(04:36:15)<the_ru>I brought a box home from work with a lot of transformers and other junk
(04:36:32)<the_ru>most of the 9Vs I'll probably find use for some day
(04:36:34)<jraregris>is it a store bought stompbox?
(04:36:55)<the_ru>there are some odd ones though, like 40V and 13.8V
(04:37:00)<the_ru>jraregris: yes, Behringer
(04:37:26)<jraregris>I've got a pair of those
(04:37:30)<the_ru>I think I have 8 or so
(04:37:34)<the_ru>too cheap to resist :-O
(04:37:35)<jraregris>it's the boss-a-likes, yes?
(04:37:38)<the_ru>but most sound like shit actually
(04:37:39)<the_ru>yes
(04:37:43)<jraregris>:)
(04:38:02)<the_ru>I mostly use the tremolo and the chorus
(04:38:23)<the_ru>The Ultra Metal is nice, but doesn't really fit the music I play
(04:38:31)<jraregris>I've got the blues drive and metal zone or something
(04:39:12)<the_ru>hm
(04:39:27)<the_ru>the blues overdrive, is it similar to the overdrive distortion?
(04:39:51)<the_ru>the overdrive distortion, ultra distortion and ultra flanger I haven't really found any use for
(04:39:58)<the_ru>maybe when doing insane noise experiments...
(04:40:19)<the_ru>also have an EQ but I haven't had time to use it much yet
(04:40:42)<jraregris>I've hardly tried them out actually
(04:41:03)<jraregris>I've been trough a couple of years dry spell when it comes to guitar playing
(04:41:13)<jraregris>i√¶ve been playing mostly acoustic
(04:41:22)<the_ru>I play ukulele :-)
(04:41:48)<jraregris>:)
(04:42:23)<the_ru>I'm usually an octave above the guitar though, so most stompboxes aren't very well suited for it
(04:42:29)<jraregris>lately I've been playing some good electric guitar, but in the mean time my girlfriend bought me a semi-custom stompbox
(04:43:17)<the_ru>I was going to build my own, but I never got started
(04:43:37)<the_ru>bought a lot of components but then other things got in the way
(04:43:45)<the_ru>that was 1¬Ω year ago :-)
(04:43:57)<jraregris>my girlfriend got me this: http://www.meme.no/locomofon/monito_fuzz1.php
(04:44:37)<jraregris>I've got the #002 ever made
(04:44:53)<the_ru>:-)
(04:44:57)<the_ru>is it good?
(04:44:58)<jraregris>it's about $400
(04:45:25)<jraregris>yeah, it's really warm and nice
(04:45:39)<the_ru>... it
(04:45:47)<the_ru>it'd better be, at that price :-)
(04:51:15)<the_ru>I wonder what printer support in Linux is like these days
(05:16:10)<jomiolto>I have no idea what linux printer support is in general, but at least my hp deskjet works brilliantly; just plug in the usb cable and wait a few seconds for the os to configure the printer and it's all done
(05:19:37)<deveah>68%...
(05:20:23)<jomiolto>that's almost 70%!
(05:20:38)<jomiolto>:)
(05:21:43)<deveah>71% now, but it's hard work...

(05:30:47)<jraregris>is it a .po/.mo-file or something?

(05:31:46)<jraregris>i began translating UFO2000 to Norwegian a year ago, but never finished it
(05:32:03)<deveah>how many strings did it have?
(05:32:28)<deveah>mine around 600
(05:32:36)<jraregris>it think it was less
(05:33:04)<jraregris>but it wasn't ver clean, if you know what I mean
(05:33:27)<jraregris>I had to insert line breaks and such to not screw up the gui
(05:33:54)<deveah>i think i'm going to leave it, it's too *hard* for me - for example many strings are meaningless, strings which i have never forund on the site

(05:52:25)<deveah>Deveah'sProjectsRL - be thought of and never be made
(05:52:48)<joe6pack>i havn't been paying attention to rgrd at all in the past couple of weeek
(05:52:52)<joe6pack>*weeks
(05:53:02)<joe6pack>i have a ton of work at the uni
(05:53:10)<joe6pack>and am going to a lot of job interviews
(05:53:16)<deveah>what jobs?
(05:53:18)<joe6pack>and palying diplomacy :)
(05:53:23)<joe6pack>as a programmer
(05:53:35)<deveah>good job
(05:53:41)<deveah>6h/day
(05:53:46)<joe6pack>matrixware.com
(05:53:52)<deveah>good wages
(05:54:00)<joe6pack>i'm interviewing with this company in a few days
(05:54:25)<joe6pack>might be itneresting work, natural language processing, searching
(05:54:50)<deveah>why don't you come in Romania, where prices are always small?
(05:54:57)<joe6pack>a bit more algorithmic than just some enterprise application 
(05:55:10)<joe6pack>deveah: i've actually worked for a romanian company in the past
(05:55:28)<deveah>BitSoft?
(05:55:56)<joe6pack>softgress.com
(05:56:40)<deveah>and you've been here?
(05:56:57)<deveah>in Cluj, where it's full of hungarians?
(05:57:11)<deveah>(joking, I'm not ging to start again)
(05:57:15)<deveah>*going
(05:57:28)<joe6pack>no. i worked at the Viennese company they sold a system to
(05:57:46)<deveah>oh
(05:57:50)<joe6pack>so i was here in vienna and we were communicating via skype 
(05:58:09)<joe6pack>and every couple of months some of them came here for a few days
(05:58:25)<joe6pack>some people in this company work from home anyway,
(05:58:26)<deveah>cool
(05:58:44)<deveah>that's an advantage of being a programmer
(05:58:52)<joe6pack>so it doesn't matter if their home is in transilvania or vienna 
(05:59:41)<deveah>70.5 kb - a graphical roguelike in FB with all you need!
(06:00:01)<joe6pack>how do you know what i need?
(06:00:32)<deveah>i just studied the advantages of being a programmer for a school project
(06:01:04)<joe6pack>yes?
(06:02:41)<deveah>good wage, stress-less job (exept for the bugs), 6h a day work, you can work from home, wages get bigger when the prices go up because it's not a company that belongs to the state, you work in a comfortable office etc
(06:03:11)<joe6pack>she's pretty cute actually. too bad we're related 
(06:03:21)<deveah>she who?
(06:03:35)<joe6pack>wrong window...
(06:03:58)<joe6pack> joe6pack> R343L: i recently had a woman i have never met nor heard
(06:04:03)<joe6pack> of add me on facebook
(06:04:07)<joe6pack> joe6pack> turned out to be some distant cousin
(06:04:50)<joe6pack>deveah: 6h/day? more like 9-10h/day
(06:05:15)<deveah>in Romania, due to recent legislation, computer-dependant jobs are max 6h/day
(06:05:34)<deveah>every legal job here has to be max 8/h day
(06:05:36)<joe6pack>so they probably work fridays as well
(06:05:39)<deveah>8h/day
(06:05:52)<joe6pack>sounds very odd
(06:05:59)<deveah>what do you mean by fridays? do you have 3-day weekends?
(06:06:08)<joe6pack>sorry,
(06:06:15)<joe6pack>i meant Saturdays 
(06:06:44)<deveah>no they don't
(06:06:52)<the_ru>deveah: stress-less? huh
(06:07:02)<deveah>i said "except for the bugs"
(06:07:12)<the_ru>well, even without the bugs...
(06:07:19)<joe6pack>deveah: so that would be except for 90% of the work?
(06:07:46)<the_ru>and if you have a comfortable office or not is pretty much up to the individual employer
(06:08:19)<deveah>what i meant is that you don't work outside, in cold or heat
(06:08:29)<deveah>you work indoors, which is waaay better
(06:09:04)<the_ru>not always
(06:09:41)<the_ru>if you do it even for 6 hours/day without proper ergonomical equipment, your body will be worn out
(06:10:21)<the_ru>not to mention the psychological things; even the buzzing of a computer fan gets very annoying after a while
(06:11:20)<the_ru>some companies think money spent on the employees health is wasted
(06:11:26)<the_ru>but OTOH, as a programmer it'
(06:11:53)<the_ru>s easy to just get another job at an employer that understands your value
(06:16:05)<deveah>and here in Romania, there's a lack of trained professionals in programming, so whereever you go, you're hired
(06:16:24)<joe6pack>deveah: that's the way it is in a lot of places
(06:23:15)<the_ru>ok
(06:23:26)<the_ru>any suggestions for random scroll labels?
(06:23:33)<the_ru>(LOLWUT is taken)
(06:28:59)<the_ru>There is a scroll labeled LOLWUT here.
(07:12:32)<jraregris>deveah|quake: that romulation.net, does it destroy me if i register?
(07:20:03)<deveah|quake>destroy? no
(07:37:10)<the_ru>I have added stealth, an overworld, removed color...
(07:37:16)<the_ru>yet it feels like there is something missing
(07:37:33)<the_ru>to give this release any significant impact
(08:47:07)<the_ru>:-(
(08:47:13)<the_ru>I'm terrible at writing help pages
(08:47:20)<the_ru>anyone feel up to the task?
(08:55:23)<the_ru>"Careful planning will let you sneak past enemies. Your Stealth Points (shown in the status display as asterisks) tell how well hidden you are. When they are depleted, you are fully visible and enemies can see you. You lose a stealth point for each you begin on a lit square or adjacent to an enemy. Certain other actions also cost stealth points, such as opening and closing doors, attacking or setting off traps. You regain stealth points each turn you
(08:55:33)<the_ru>Does that make any sense at all?
(09:03:46)<Glowie>You missed a word there, otherwise yeah
(09:03:59)<Glowie>Oh wait nope
(09:04:06)<Glowie>Just my eyes
(09:04:10)<Glowie>Makes sense.
(09:04:14)<the_ru>ok
(09:04:21)<Glowie>Oh wait again
(09:04:24)<Glowie>Turn
(09:04:30)<Glowie>You lose a stealth point for each you begin on a lit square or
(09:04:40)<Glowie>Shouldn't there be turn somewhere there
(09:04:54)<the_ru>yes
(09:04:57)<the_ru>how about
(09:05:04)<the_ru>"You lose a stealth point each turn you begin on a lit square or adjacent to an enemy."
(09:05:07)<Glowie>My eyes are double fooling me
(09:05:15)<Glowie>Works perfectly
(09:06:02)<the_ru>is it clear that you lose stealth even on dark squares if an enemy is adjacent?
(09:06:18)<Glowie>Yup to me
(09:06:21)<the_ru>ok
(09:06:48)<the_ru>I don't really need to explain *every* mechanic in detail; there should be some experimentation for the player as well
(09:12:04)<the_ru>Excellent.
(09:12:13)<the_ru>ncurses lets me use√ø \n
(09:14:51)<the_ru>it breaks the line within the same window
(11:13:02)<the_ru>hah
(11:13:04)<the_ru>WTF.
(11:13:15)<the_ru>I've written "I dunno what this is for." as comment for a function
(11:16:51)<the_ru>ok
(11:16:53)<the_ru>find the error
(11:16:55)<the_ru>if (token[0] == "\n")
(11:20:10)<Kadwiell>Should be '\n'?
(11:20:39)<the_ru>aye
(11:20:46)<the_ru>unless token is a char** :-)
(11:20:59)<the_ru>but I dunno how much sense it would be to compare the pointer to a static string
(11:37:35)<the_ru>hm
(11:38:15)<the_ru>I wonder how I can change my generator to fill random rooms with walls without breaking connectivity
(11:39:34)<the_ru>they're a bit too predictable when every map is exactly a rectangle
(11:39:44)<the_ru>I want "dead" sections of wall in the middle of the map
(11:40:23)<the_ru>but just picking random rooms to fill makes map generation wasteful
(11:40:39)<the_ru>currently at 32% valid
+++ The date has changed: 2008/04/20 +++
(03:42:27)<xJabberwocky>is there a way in c++ to check if an object has an overloaded operator (during compile/run time)?
(10:10:08)<the_ru>probably not
(10:10:13)<the_ru>I don't know C++ though
(10:10:58)<the_ru>are C++ programs even aware of classes when they run?
(10:11:11)<the_ru>or is it just a compiler thing...
(10:21:04)<the_ru>Hm hm
(10:21:06)<the_ru>What do you think
(10:21:46)<the_ru>should I rename my "stealth points" to just stealth, and make my "stealth" attribute a "sneak" skill?
(10:25:37)<the_ru>morning
(10:29:31)<joe6pack>good morning 
(10:29:42)<joe6pack>was thinking of starting some coding roday
(10:29:44)<joe6pack>today
(10:29:51)<joe6pack>since i have nothing better to do
(10:29:56)<joe6pack>but the problem is
(10:30:07)<joe6pack>i know i won't have time this week to work on it
(10:30:19)<joe6pack>nor in any subsequent week
(10:30:47)<joe6pack>since i am doing a shitload of courses at the uni this semster
(10:30:54)<joe6pack>and am also going to job interview
(10:30:55)<joe6pack>s
(10:47:38)<the_ru>if you never get started nothing will happen :-)
(10:48:30)<joe6pack>yes i know
(10:48:56)<joe6pack>but even if i get started now not much will happen because i will only have 1 day to work on it
(10:49:31)<the_ru>BreakfastRL - don't get stuck in sticky marmalade
(10:49:34)<joe6pack>i have anotgher interview on Thursday in a company that might do some interesting stuff
(10:50:31)<joe6pack>in stark contrast to all other companies i've worked for till now, which was always some boring "enterprise applications" or something of that sort
(10:50:45)<joe6pack>but we'll see how it goes
(10:51:29)<joe6pack>the_ru: you work as a programmer, right?
(10:51:34)<the_ru>no
(10:51:48)<joe6pack>what do you do?
(10:52:19)<the_ru>design electrical/automation circuits
(10:52:24)<joe6pack>cool
(10:52:35)<joe6pack>kind of like programming in a wat,
(10:52:38)<joe6pack>*way
(10:52:41)<the_ru>but right now I'm stuck with administration and documentation :-(
(10:52:42)<joe6pack>only lower level :)
(10:52:45)<the_ru>yes
(10:52:55)<joe6pack>'lo purestrain 
(10:53:16)<the_ru>but we don't do much "logic" really, it's just a bunch of cables connected to I/Os
(10:53:26)<joe6pack>:|
(10:53:28)<joe6pack>boring?
(10:53:36)<the_ru>other companies usually do the actual programming of the system
(10:53:44)<the_ru>not really, there's a lot to learn
(10:53:52)<the_ru>and I don't want to work with programming anyway
(10:53:58)<joe6pack>ok
(10:54:54)<the_ru>right now I'm wasting my time dealing with other peoples documentation
(10:55:09)<the_ru>they're building two new iron ore refining plants here, so there's a lot of paperwork...
(10:55:16)<the_ru>... which no one will ever look at again, though
(10:55:25)<joe6pack>hehe
(10:55:44)<the_ru>but everything has to be checked, indexed and put into the archives :-/
(10:55:45)<joe6pack>the usual "we need x meters of documentation" 
(10:55:56)<the_ru>afe
(10:55:57)<the_ru>aye
(10:56:09)<joe6pack>which will then be filed in a cabinet and gather dust
(10:56:25)<the_ru>cabinet... more like a football field in this case :-O
(10:56:58)<the_ru>for some reason, they want every blueprint in 3 copies, every manual in *5* copies
(10:57:25)<joe6pack>you indirectly contribute to the massacre of our forests
(10:57:30)<joe6pack>;)
(10:57:32)<the_ru>Siemens deliver switchgear equipment, and their manual is like 15 binders
(10:57:43)<the_ru>15 binders * 5 copies * one for each plant = 150
(10:57:45)<the_ru>:-(
(10:58:13)<joe6pack>such a senseless waste of paper...
(10:58:27)<joe6pack>exactly what i'd excpect from a governmental project
(10:58:48)<the_ru>indeed - especially when the people that will be running the plant say "we'll never look at these"
(10:59:11)<joe6pack>'lo Glowie. we were just discussing how the_ru is killing the earth
(10:59:45)<the_ru>and the worst thing - it's a 600 million euro project, ending in june, and they *still* haven't decided what format they want the blueprints delivered in
(10:59:51)<Glowie>I see, morning to you too
(11:01:28)<joe6pack>so far he's aiding the decimation of forests and strip mining of virgin Scandinavian land for its iron
(11:02:07)<joe6pack>probably also driving a car to work :p
(11:02:13)<the_ru>actually, it's an underground mine
(11:02:21)<the_ru>the worlds largest, they say
(11:02:25)<joe6pack>therefor contributing to global warming
(11:06:44)<Glowie>Isn't it a bit too early in the morning for Earth killing plans?
(11:07:06)<joe6pack>the wicked never rest
(11:07:16)<Glowie>Guess so
(11:32:11)<the_ru>huh
(11:32:13)<the_ru>who was that
(11:33:00)<joe6pack>segfault1? some lurker 
(11:33:06)<joe6pack>he never says anything

(11:33:15)<joe6pack>deveah
(11:33:22)<the_ru>A-ha
(11:33:27)<the_ru>I don't see joins and parts
(11:38:46)<deveah>yes ido
(11:39:38)<deveah>irssi takes my username as nickname
(11:39:51)<joe6pack>yea most clients seem to do that 
(11:40:20)<joe6pack>but i configured irssi to change mine on startup just before joining the chan
(11:41:00)<deveah>it's been 3 days and the topic is the same
(11:41:11)<joe6pack>feel free to change it
(11:42:47)<deveah>I'm not chnnel op :(
(11:42:52)<deveah>*channel
(11:43:00)<joe6pack>you can change it nevertheless i think
(11:43:13)<joe6pack>in case you can't :)
(11:43:22)<deveah>thanks ;)
(11:44:52)<deveah>mmmm... spamish flavour
(11:45:34)<deveah>do you know how to 'mod' the windows console?
(11:45:47)<deveah>i'd like to hide its maximize btn
(11:46:18)<the_ru>get a real OS :-O
(11:48:01)<joe6pack>deveah: i don't know if it's even possible 
(11:49:32)<Glowie>Probably not, the colors are changeable manually/using a shortcut as is the font size but not much more
(11:49:53)<Glowie>Some use SDL or similar to create their own "console"
(11:50:06)<the_ru>why bother? the DOS prompt sucks anyway
(11:50:15)<deveah>i'm making Microgue - the 12x9 roguelike
(11:50:25)<deveah>tinylike better
(11:50:44)<deveah>the_ru: why sucks?
(11:51:08)<Glowie>Does its job
(11:51:39)<the_ru>first of all, it's too slow
(11:51:58)<the_ru>it can't be resized
(11:52:18)<the_ru>and in a standard windows install, there are very few "DOS" programs that are actually useful
(11:52:51)<deveah>well my console gets a max of 795 fps
(11:52:58)<deveah>you can easily resize it
(11:53:09)<deveah>i do with the command "width" in FB
(11:53:26)<deveah>and i don't care about other programs
(11:54:07)<the_ru>hm
(11:54:14)<the_ru>it can be resized vertically, it seems
(11:54:52)<the_ru>and command.com is a very crude shell
(11:55:04)<deveah>freebasic has the command "width" for it
(11:55:06)<the_ru>it gets somewhat better with doskey, but once you've used bash or similar, you'll never go back
(11:55:19)<the_ru>ok
(11:55:26)<the_ru>so how do I apply that to any program?
(11:56:45)<deveah>i don't know
(11:57:03)<joe6pack>the_ru: it can be resized in both directions iirc
(11:57:12)<the_ru>joe6pack: maybe in XP and later
(11:57:17)<the_ru>I tried it W2K
(11:57:20)<deveah>it can to me
(11:57:22)<the_ru>it
(11:57:22)<the_ru>in
(11:57:29)<deveah>win 2000 is similar to win nt and xp
(11:57:42)<deveah>they're in the same category: 2000/nt/xp
(11:57:56)<the_ru>the same category of what?
(11:57:57)<joe6pack>iirc it can also be resized in win 98 but maybe i'm remembering it wrong
(11:58:19)<the_ru>I've never been able to :-/
(11:58:29)<the_ru>but OTOH; what text applications are there anyway
(11:59:16)<deveah>roguelikes
(11:59:18)<the_ru>my point is; Microsoft isn't a good platform for developers. you'll just keep running into these arbitrary limitations everywhere
(11:59:19)<deveah>duh
(12:00:06)<the_ru>though one good thing about the DOS prompt is its ability to switch to full-screen
(12:02:46)<deveah>yes, although you can only switch to fullscreen if you have the sizes: 80x25, 80x50 and 40*25
(12:05:07)<the_ru>that's a limitation that makes sense though, since it's in the hardware
(12:13:55)<deveah>i found the perfect Microgue tune! my "Pixelled Nightmare" !
(12:19:58)<deveah>17.5 kb! with replayer!
(12:21:34)<deveah>ufmod is the king replayer
(12:29:53)<deveah>http://www.filehost.ro/322685/microgue_soundtest_zip/
(12:30:39)<deveah>win32
(02:56:48)<deveah>lolcats rule
(03:13:08)<the_ru>what the hell is wrong with the warez crowd
(03:13:15)<the_ru>why do they still rar, then zip?
(03:17:27)<the_ru>and why, after all these years, do I still find myself playing HOMM2?
(03:41:06)<the_ru>and why is it so hard to write help pages
(03:41:21)<the_ru>how should I arrange them?
(03:41:46)<the_ru>should I sort game elements by type or function?
(03:42:00)<the_ru>e.g. HP; should it be among the attributes or in the "combat" section?
(04:08:28)<jomiolto>the_ru: curse you, now I've got to get HOMM2 and I'm probably going to end up using all my freetime playing it :/
(04:08:47)<jomiolto>it is a brilliant game, but I was never too good in it
(04:30:46)<deveah>homm2?
(04:30:59)<deveah>oh
(04:33:30)<jomiolto>heroes of might and magic 2; one of the greatest games ever :)
(04:34:16)<jomiolto>hmm, this is why proprietary software sucks: I know I have a legit homm2 cd *somewhere*, but I have no idea where, so I'll just have to pirate it anyway...
(04:36:50)<jomiolto>or then it's just my organization skills (or lack of them) that suck :P
(08:01:07)<the_ru>I have an ISO if you want it
(08:01:26)<the_ru>and I'm not very good at it either, but it's still fun to play
(08:01:53)<the_ru>I'm too much of a "all eggs in one basket" person
(08:02:11)<the_ru>I build one good hero, but once enemies start appearing he's too slow to cover all ground
(08:02:46)<the_ru>I think hero/troop balance is very interesting
(08:03:23)<the_ru>a good hero is very powerful even with basic troops (goblins, for example)
(08:03:49)<the_ru>OTOH, giving a bad hero powerful troops won't make him much better
(08:03:52)<the_ru>...
(08:08:48)<the_ru>hm
(08:09:01)<the_ru>should I ship TSL 0.10
(08:23:40)<the_ru>I think I shouldn't rush it
(08:24:05)<the_ru>there's still some work to do to make it work well
(08:24:05)<the_ru>tuesday, maybe
(08:48:36)<the_ru>'lo
(09:06:15)<the_ru>hm hm
(09:06:45)<the_ru>It feels like I can't avoid color anyway :-/
(09:08:23)<the_ru>But now that I've removed it, I can put it back in and rewrite it in a smarter way
(09:08:48)<the_ru>where entities don't need to care about their displayed glyph/color, just what it is
(09:08:55)<the_ru>and the UI will decide how to display it
(09:09:02)<the_ru>... the way it should work, IMO
(09:16:06)<the_ru>can C pass structs by value?
(09:16:09)<the_ru>anyone know?
(09:16:12)<the_ru>is it a bad idea in general?
(10:13:22)<the_ru>ok
(10:13:27)<the_ru>let's see if this works...
(10:14:28)<the_ru>no
(10:14:33)<the_ru>SIGSEGV
(10:14:38)<the_ru>should be easy to fix...
(10:16:54)<the_ru>hell yeah

(10:17:27)<the_ru>I'm writing a system for "graphical entities"
(10:17:58)<the_ru>that is then translated into a ncurses character + color pair + attributes
(10:19:19)<the_ru>so for example a ghoul only needs to specify it wants to be displayed as a ghoul, and doesn't have to care beyond that
(10:19:37)<the_ru>then it's up to the UI to decide if it should be displayed as a Z, a bitmap or a 3D model...
(10:19:45)<the_ru>I only care about the first case though
(10:22:17)<the_ru>(I guess most RLs already have this)
(10:22:35)<the_ru>since I like to do things the hard way, I saved it until late in the development cycle
(10:22:39)<the_ru>... hello?
(10:22:41)<the_ru>anyone here? :-)
(10:23:54)<the_ru>jomiolto: weren't you doing something like this?
(10:24:10)<the_ru>I remember discussing separate layers with someone
(11:29:43)<RotateMe>poor the_ru :(
(11:29:57)<RotateMe>sry i can't help you with that, i'm a c noob myself
(11:30:20)<RotateMe>screenshot looks nice though
(11:30:29)<RotateMe>except for the ?s as walls
(11:31:55)<RotateMe>someday i'm going to install linux just to play tsl
(11:32:16)<RotateMe>or i'm going to port the game... who knows

(09:44:54)<deveah>hamsters are cute
(09:44:57)<deveah>i had one
(09:45:02)<deveah>it lived 2 years
(09:45:24)<deveah>okay okay
(09:45:46)<deveah>i had a aquarium to keep my hamster in

(09:46:03)<deveah>thanks
(09:46:27)<deveah>once 2 days you have to change its "terrain" and take him for a walk in the house
(09:46:43)<deveah>don't put magazines on the ground
(09:46:50)<deveah>he will just crunch them

(12:52:56)<deveah>winsock.ocx
(12:53:26)<purestrain>i would say it requires internet explorer ?
(12:53:44)<deveah>not really
(12:53:54)<deveah>.ocx files extend VB's features
(12:54:10)<purestrain>so it requires VB ?
(12:54:13)<deveah>yes
(12:54:28)<deveah>http://planetsourcecode.com - search for "winsock"
(12:55:05)<purestrain>but i don't own vb
(12:57:25)<deveah>http://gamingdimension.net/deveah/nanorl/nanorl-v002.zip
(01:37:29)<Aerton>not sure about XP, but win9x had a terminal program in the 
(01:37:33)<Aerton>OS package
(02:02:31)<joe6pack>purestrain: you can get vb for free on the web
(02:02:41)<joe6pack>express edition or something like that
(02:03:40)<purestrain>of course; but its not worth it, i already found a nice program
(02:06:37)<purestrain>i'll want to read some data from my gps device; but it always crashes :-o
(02:14:22)<deveah>has anyone tested my NanoRL?
(02:18:58)<TMCGone>orange foam?
(02:19:08)<TMCGone>save load system?
(02:19:09)<TMCGone>I dobut there'd be enough content in a 3drl to warrant it
(02:21:06)<joe6pack>TMCGone: it some sort of synthetic foam for him to build a nest out of
(02:21:25)<joe6pack>s/it/it's
(02:26:42)<deveah>3drl will be tomorrow - today it's a 2drl, TMCGone :)
(02:34:27)<purestrain>yeah... reading some simple data from serial port and windows restarts...

(03:09:43)<RotateMe>hi
(03:10:00)<RotateMe>first time using a unix system ;)
(03:10:11)<RotateMe>and first thing i did was playing tsl
(03:14:03)<RotateMe>the_ru, what's the default setting for the screen-size?
(03:16:22)<RotateMe>and what has to be the name of the config file? tsl.conf doesn't seem to work for me :(
(03:35:30)<joe6pack>hi RotateMe 
(03:35:40)<joe6pack>thanks for the corrections 
(03:40:21)<RotateMe>no problem
(03:40:39)<RotateMe>one thing wasn't clear: about which "arbeit" are you talking
(03:40:57)<RotateMe>is this something you did for university and are not allowed to talk about publicely?
(03:49:16)<the_ru>RotateMe: 80x24
(03:49:22)<the_ru>.tsl.conf
(03:49:42)<the_ru>deveah|eat: winsock is for network sockets, not serial ports?
(03:51:25)<RotateMe>the_ru, what do i do if i want to remap the directions to the numpad?
(03:51:51)<the_ru>RotateMe: bind n 8
(03:51:54)<the_ru>for example
(03:51:59)<the_ru>but then you need to have numlock on
(03:52:05)<RotateMe>hm did that but doesn't work
(03:52:31)<the_ru>I'm not sure about the direction keys; they probably send some weird sequence
(03:52:40)<Aerton>yes, winsock is for net sockets, not for direct access of ports
(03:53:53)<Aerton>IIRC, there was something in MFC for serial ports
(03:53:54)<the_ru>RotateMe: also, there's a difference between bind and bindn
(03:55:37)<the_ru>I wonder what kind of data he was going to transfer
(03:56:02)<the_ru>normally HyperTerminal should be enough, but from a GPS it's probably binary data
(03:56:04)<RotateMe>strange, it doesn't work :(
(03:56:17)<the_ru>hm
(03:56:21)<the_ru>what are you running?
(03:56:27)<the_ru>Ubuntu under Windows?
(03:56:30)<RotateMe>ubuntu
(03:56:32)<RotateMe>no
(03:56:41)<RotateMe>not under windows
(03:56:50)<the_ru>ok
(03:57:02)<the_ru>is the config in the right place?
(03:57:08)<the_ru>i.e. your /home directory
(03:57:38)<RotateMe>it's to go there? alrighty :D
(03:58:08)<RotateMe>like i said, that's the first thing i run with a unix system
(03:58:18)<the_ru>a-ha
(03:58:33)<the_ru>well, it only checks the home directory
(04:00:22)<RotateMe>hmm does ubuntu hide files that start with a '.'?
(04:00:42)<RotateMe>i can't seem to find my config file, but when i try to save it, ubuntu says it already exists
(04:03:21)<RotateMe>ah okay, it does hide them
(04:03:37)<RotateMe>still doesn't seem to work...
(04:03:43)<RotateMe>(now it's in my home dir)
(04:04:04)<the_ru>well, it doesn't really hide them
(04:04:10)<the_ru>more like "not display them by default"
(04:04:12)<the_ru>ls -a
(04:04:44)<RotateMe>yeah found that
(04:04:46)<the_ru>try adding "color no" to it; then you'll see if it's read properly
(04:04:55)<RotateMe>ah okay
(04:07:32)<RotateMe>what's the terminal command to move files (xcopy style)
(04:07:44)<the_ru>mv
(04:11:09)<RotateMe>it doesn't read properly
(04:11:16)<RotateMe>no color doesn't change anyhting
(04:11:47)<RotateMe>i tried to put the file both in my /home and /home/rotateme dir but nothing happened
(04:12:55)<the_ru>strange
(05:08:13)<RotateMe_away>ah, mirc is still the best
(05:22:50)<deveah|eat>jazz jackrabbit 2 is the best
(05:48:27)<joe6pack>RotateMe_away: no, it was something i did at another company
(05:49:43)<the_ru>RotateMe_away: that's weird though; it has worked for me across all Linux/BSD/Solaris variants I've tried
(05:50:43)<RotateMe_away>the_ru: it's probably because ubuntu uses a config file dir i don't know of
(05:51:18)<the_ru>hm, no
(05:51:28)<the_ru>TSL looks in the home directory
(05:52:10)<RotateMe_away>"/home" or "/home/<user-name>"?
(05:52:19)<the_ru>/home/username/.tsl.conf
(05:52:37)<RotateMe_away>maybe i should try it with sudo because the normal user has no way to access files in the home dir or sth
(05:52:46)<the_ru>if you have time later I can write a test application that says where it goes wrong
(05:52:54)<the_ru>huh
(05:53:07)<the_ru>hm, well, Ubuntu does some things in strange ways
(05:53:15)<the_ru>but you ought to have access to your /home?
(05:53:33)<RotateMe_away>only with sudo
(05:53:55)<RotateMe_away>well read access was there all the time but maybe not through unknown apps or sth...
(05:54:03)<the_ru>hm
(05:54:04)<the_ru>weird

(02:11:23)<the_ru>Time travel!
(02:11:34)<the_ru>I wonder if it could be done in a roguelike, Chrono Trigger-style
(02:13:20)<the_ru>I have ideas especially for a location in my game, that is mentioned in present-day chronicles as having been sealed by an unknown hero
(02:13:35)<the_ru>what if I let the player go back in time, and be the hero in the old days as well?
(02:15:36)<the_ru>perhaps it could be implemented as single scenarios, like a dream sequence or something
(02:15:46)<the_ru>you fall asleep, and find yourself in the past
(02:15:58)<the_ru>once you complete that specific dungeon, you return to your own age
(02:16:27)<the_ru>so when you go there in present day, it will be just like you left it
(02:17:20)<the_ru>hi joe6pack 
(02:17:24)<joe6pack>hi the_ru 
(02:17:38)<the_ru>I'm having a monologue about time travel, want to join in?
(02:17:46)<joe6pack>ok
(02:18:01)<the_ru>I'm pondering letting the player visit certain locations in the past
(02:18:16)<joe6pack>i will join in pretending to listen  ;)
(02:18:39)<the_ru>one dungeon in particular, that in present-day chronicles is mentioned as having been sealed by a hero
(02:18:45)<joe6pack>wouldn't that introduce a grandfather paradox? 
(02:18:48)<the_ru>what if I let the player go back in time and be that hero?
(02:19:00)<the_ru>heh
(02:19:39)<joe6pack>oh i thought you would let it revisit occurrences he alredy did himslef
(02:19:43)<the_ru>no
(02:19:55)<the_ru>it would be decades apart
(02:20:09)<joe6pack>well in that case the time travle is just a plot device
(02:20:09)<the_ru>decades - centuries
(02:20:19)<joe6pack>and has little bearing on the gameplay
(02:20:49)<the_ru>in some places it could be problematic
(02:21:01)<the_ru>if I just allow time travel into the future, it would be quite easy
(02:21:16)<the_ru>since the locations previously visited could just be fast-forwarded
(02:21:28)<the_ru>new monsters, some items have moved etc, but mostly it would be the same
(02:21:29)<joe6pack>his own future or again somewhere far away?
(02:22:00)<the_ru>far away - but would it matter?
(02:22:16)<the_ru>if he disappears at one point in time, he won't exist again until he arrives at the other time
(02:22:19)<the_ru>... I guess
(02:22:26)<joe6pack> yeah i guess you're right
(02:22:50)<the_ru>but I don't think it would be much of a problem
(02:23:01)<joe6pack>but again, it doesn't sound like something that affect the gameplay that much
(02:23:10)<the_ru>I'm not thinking of "travel back 3 turns in time and prevent myself from travelling back in time"
(02:23:11)<joe6pack>just rerandomize the level
(02:23:17)<joe6pack>:)
(02:23:30)<the_ru>yeah
(02:23:35)<the_ru>I wonder if it would be interesting though
(02:23:45)<the_ru>perhaps it could be some kind of minor sidequest
(02:24:00)<the_ru>a dream sequence, or maybe you get sucked into a history book :-)
(02:24:28)<the_ru>it could even have a different protagonist
(02:25:02)<the_ru>what about other scenarios?
(02:25:04)<joe6pack>like the dream sequence in max payne 
(02:25:21)<the_ru>you could get to play a mad mage and summon a major demon that kills you
(02:25:29)<the_ru>in the centuries that pass, the demon grows meaner and meaner
(02:25:36)<the_ru>until you have to face it again in your own age
(02:25:45)<the_ru>never played Max Payne
(02:25:51)<the_ru>I only know... Max Power!
(02:37:59)<joe6pack>just got a call from my parents

(02:52:55)<the_ru>you get a day off, and you complain? :-)

(02:56:26)<the_ru>1stOfMayRL
(02:58:01)<the_ru>"events that take up most of the day from early morning to late night on April 30, or "siste April" ("The last day of April") as it is called in Lund and elsewhere throughout the country."
(02:58:06)<the_ru>"siste April"?
(02:58:07)<the_ru>huh?
(02:58:16)<the_ru>siste would be norwegian or something
(02:59:58)<joe6pack>are the 2 languages similar? 
(03:35:14)<the_ru>similar enough for readers of one to read the other
(03:35:24)<the_ru>listening and speaking are harder, of course
(03:35:48)<the_ru>it's possible that they say "siste" in southern sweden though
(03:35:59)<the_ru>hm
(03:36:00)<the_ru>a-ha

(03:37:19)<the_ru>huh?

(03:42:05)<Aerton>xset
(03:42:44)<the_ru>xset m?
(03:43:04)<Aerton>although, I'm not sure how do you define which mouse
(03:43:54)<the_ru>I don't think it's possible
(03:44:00)<the_ru>needs to be done in xorg.conf
(03:44:15)<Aerton>I'm afraid so
(03:44:22)<the_ru>This affects both of them
(03:44:28)<the_ru>the PS/2 is much slower than the USB :-(
(03:44:35)<the_ru>but I don't intend to keep both anyway
(03:47:07)<the_ru>now; where does this camera show up
(03:47:25)<the_ru>lsusb shows it's connected
(03:47:28)<the_ru>but I can't mount it
(03:47:42)<the_ru>my own camera shows up as /dev/sdb something
(03:47:48)<the_ru>but not this one :-/
(03:48:01)<the_ru>perhaps it's not a regular USB mass storage device
(03:48:38)<deveah>anyone played NanoRL?
(03:49:01)<the_ru>maybe gphotofs can help
(03:49:07)<the_ru>deveah: what OSes will it work on?

(05:46:48)<RotateMe>sound and boobs
(05:47:01)<RotateMe>(in the background image of the menu)
(05:47:08)<purestrain>yes :P
(05:47:12)<RotateMe>alien breed was the right choice
(05:47:16)<RotateMe>praise the bot
(05:49:23)<purestrain>well; i'm not in the mood to show a movie of ugly alien breed remake :-)
(05:49:46)<RotateMe>?
(05:49:53)<RotateMe>i thought this was alien breed?
(05:50:08)<purestrain>now, that was my supposed entry for the 7drl, 'something with zombies'
(05:50:11)<purestrain>no
(05:50:28)<RotateMe>well thinking about the sound they make when they die it was stupid to think that :D
(05:50:47)<RotateMe>look nice anyway
(05:50:51)<RotateMe>*looks
(05:51:01)<RotateMe>will you release sth in near future?
(05:51:27)<purestrain>it is released as far as it is done
(05:58:15)<Kadwiell_>That's a nice aesthetic, with the heads representing characters
(05:58:27)<RotateMe>aic
(05:59:21)<RotateMe>http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/Screens/DHScreen02.JPG
(05:59:28)<RotateMe>i did it first!!! ^^
(06:00:11)<purestrain>and with a higher resolution :-)
(06:01:18)<purestrain>i'm thinking about continuing the game, but without any portable support, so i can stick to a higher resolution
(06:02:41)<purestrain>http://retroforge.de/~md/icon_key.png <- lots of characters selfmade =D
(06:03:44)<RotateMe>wow, not bad
(06:03:52)<RotateMe>i pretty much ripped all the chars i got there
(06:04:23)<purestrain>thought so, looks japanese style
(06:04:42)<purestrain>eh, anime ?
(06:04:46)<purestrain>manga? whatever
(06:06:06)<RotateMe>http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/Screens/headset.png
(06:06:22)<RotateMe>it's from rpg maker chipsets
(06:07:34)<RotateMe>the only one i drew myself is the red eyed rabbit in the row where it says 154
(06:07:48)<RotateMe>he also happens to be teh best :D
(06:08:26)<purestrain>hard to see, should use a magnifier
(06:08:36)<Aerton>http://plg.lrn.ru/uploads/HQO.png - not really an RL
(06:08:57)<purestrain>but a heroquest game
(06:09:16)<purestrain>heroquest > roguelike
(06:09:24)<purestrain>space crusade > hero quest
(06:10:22)<purestrain>i remember the good old days playing with my brothers both games
(06:11:43)<RotateMe>heroquest rules indeed
(06:14:15)<purestrain>dont you be afraid of copyright issues? like the recent 'space hulk' remake ?
(06:16:39)<Aerton>the project is abandoned long ago
(06:17:13)<Aerton>I think there are a couple of remakes
(06:17:43)<Aerton>the rules are property of Milton Bradley games, not Games Workshop
(06:17:55)<Aerton>so it's a lot less dangerous
(06:18:03)<purestrain>ah, right
(06:19:00)<Aerton>although, I wonder if I can make a Mordheim game ^^
(06:19:15)<Aerton>the rules are freely available to download
(07:45:47)<segfault1>Slashdot told me that game rules can't be copyrighted, only the text describing them can.
(08:49:33)<RotateMe>hmmm you sure this applies for computer games too?
(08:50:02)<RotateMe>i heard that nintendo copyrighted the mechanic for super mario world style level maps
(08:54:10)<the_ru>huh
(08:54:25)<the_ru>there's a huge difference between copyright and patent
(08:55:14)<the_ru>obviously Nintendo own the copyright for the code of Super Mario World
(08:55:36)<the_ru>so redistribution of it without permission would be illegal
(08:55:56)<the_ru>still, it's just that specific implementation
(08:56:13)<the_ru>a patent, OTOH, describes an *idea* and forbids others from using it
(08:58:35)<the_ru>there's also plagiarism, where you make something so similar to something else that it's obviously "stolen"
(08:59:37)<the_ru>i.e. a platform game about a plumber called Mario would violate Nintendo trademarks, even if it doesn't use content made by Nintendo
(09:39:12)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/files/tsl-0.10.tar.gz
(09:39:20)<the_ru>TSL 0.10 is out! :-)
(09:39:35)<the_ru>now with more bugs than ever
(09:42:15)<the_ru>... and I'm already working on 0.11
(09:53:00)<the_ru>I'm not even posting about this on RGRD
(10:02:18)<the_ru>"You rested for 8988 turns."
(10:39:24)<RotateMe>did you do something about me being not able to change the config? :D
(10:39:48)<RotateMe>you should add an option to enable numkey movement without this textfile stuff
(11:39:18)<TMCGone>@RotateMe: no, I just stumbled across BulletML
+++ The date has changed: 2008/04/28 +++
(05:33:22)<TMCGone>:O
(05:33:31)<TMC>I haven't pinged out in over 12 hours!
(02:17:04)<Aerton>and why I thought that it is written in lisp?
(03:25:55)<the_ru>Aerton: huh?
(03:29:38)<the_ru>anyone having posterior vitreous detachment?
(03:29:46)<the_ru>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_vitreous_detachment
(03:43:06)<Aerton>why there is no list of key in in-game help?
(03:43:25)<Aerton>it's confusing
(03:43:45)<the_ru>you're right
(04:50:21)<the_ru>Aerton: http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.11-keys.png
(04:50:25)<the_ru>something like this?
(04:50:50)<the_ru>(they adjust to display the keys that are actually mapped)
(05:14:13)<Aerton>yeah
(05:14:23)<Aerton>even defaults would be nice
(05:14:36)<Aerton>these, who redefine keys already knows them
(05:15:03)<the_ru>I'm sometimes unsure myself what keys I have mapped :-O
(05:15:17)<the_ru>but thanks for the suggestion; I often forget about things like these myself
(05:15:41)<the_ru>now I just need to figure out how to deal with keypads
(05:16:38)<Aerton>it should not be a problem, ncurses recognises their sequences for you
(05:17:00)<the_ru>not here :-/
(05:17:12)<the_ru>I'm writing a test program right now to figure out what happens
(05:18:49)<Aerton>IIRC, you should call some function to enable recognition
(05:18:54)<the_ru>keypad(), yes
(05:20:43)<the_ru>hm hm
(05:21:06)<the_ru>they give > 255 values for getch()
(05:21:20)<the_ru>but they're not the same as in ncurses.h
(05:22:01)<the_ru>e.g. up gives 259, but ncurses.h says 403
(05:23:16)<Aerton>hmm
(05:23:43)<the_ru>and some keys give multiple bytes
(05:23:55)<the_ru>gives 27 79 111
(05:23:58)<the_ru>/ gives 27 79 111
(05:24:23)<Aerton>0403 == 259
(05:24:43)<the_ru>what? is it octal?
(05:24:52)<Aerton>yes
(05:25:30)<the_ru>a-ha
(05:25:33)<the_ru>well, that explains a lot
(05:26:21)<Aerton>cursor and other keys do send multiple codes, but curses should translate them according to the current terminal type
(05:26:42)<the_ru>I guess / on the numpad is an unknown escape sequence then
(05:26:48)<the_ru>considering the 27
(05:27:49)<Aerton>perhaps
(05:27:52)<Aerton>27 is escape
(05:28:01)<Aerton>it starts all these sequences
(05:28:09)<the_ru>yes
(05:28:17)<the_ru>so I suppose ncurses doesn't understand that particular one
(05:28:41)<the_ru>but anyway; it works now
(05:29:06)<the_ru>my "bindn" config directive can bind the KEY_* constants
(05:29:14)<the_ru>but how portable is it?
(05:29:44)<the_ru>it *should* be very portable, as long as the same ncurses version is used
(05:29:45)<the_ru>I guess.
(05:30:00)<the_ru>that's what I do mostly, guess :-)
(05:30:54)<Aerton>ncurses does not seem to change rapidly
(05:31:28)<Aerton>although, there are other curses implementations
(05:31:46)<Aerton>but I think these constants should be common, save for some exotic keys
(05:43:47)<the_ru>the constants should be safe to use, I think
(05:43:56)<the_ru>since ncurses sets them
(05:44:23)<the_ru>I think a bigger worry is if ncurses will be able to translate all kinds of sequences from weird terminals into those constants
(05:44:44)<the_ru>but that's far beyond anything I can do
(05:44:58)<the_ru>except manually parsing sequences, of course :-)
(05:46:47)<the_ru>and I doubt anyone needs to map things to odd keys anyway
(05:47:22)<the_ru>with keypad, letters (+uppercase), numbers there ought to be enough (normal) keys for anyone
(06:09:09)<the_ru>so; keypad support and key summary added
(06:09:12)<the_ru>what else is missing?
(06:11:45)<the_ru>a windows port
(06:11:46)<the_ru>HAH
(06:11:57)<the_ru>graphics
(06:11:58)<the_ru>HAH
(06:13:37)<the_ru>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437
(06:14:26)<the_ru>I remember making "ASCII art" with those on my 286
(06:17:12)<the_ru>... but it was actually CP437 art
(06:18:31)<Aerton>using high ascii is a really bad idea
(06:18:44)<Aerton>you can never tell how will it look on other's screens
(06:27:19)<Kadwiell_>That particular set of ASCII extensions is so common that most decent terminals can be set to support it, though.. isn't it the default look of NetHack?
(06:27:43)<Kadwiell_>Of course, it's probably best to have an option to revert to ascii proper
(06:35:02)<Aerton>may be in dos, but on unix nethack does not seem to use any high ascii
(06:35:25)<Aerton>these are often used to redefine symbols for national alphabets
(06:41:10)<Kadwiell_>The debian package seems to have "IBMgraphics" set as default for me. Admittedly, the debian package doesn't actually display correctly for me out-of-the-box either :)

(06:41:36)<RotateMe>strangest roguelike possibly out there
(06:45:29)<Kadwiell_>Huh, certainly a strange setting.. attractive graphics at least
(06:48:15)<TMC>just imagine
(06:48:52)<TMC>an IRC client which realises it's pinged out if it doesn't recieve anything from the server for 2 hours
(06:49:15)<TMC>how wonderful it would be
(06:49:30)<TMC>one day, I'm going to stop using this ancient mirc version
(06:51:39)<RotateMe>does anybody has an black-cats account he wants to share for one download?
(06:52:34)<RotateMe>*have ^^
(06:55:49)<TMCSleep>I have a black and white cat :3
(06:58:14)<RotateMe>i had a brown and now i need black-cats :P
(07:34:14)<the_ru>CP437 isn't well supported at all
(07:34:33)<the_ru>but I guess all it needs is a terminal and font that supports it
(07:34:53)<the_ru>so how come there is no GTARL?
(07:43:01)<the_ru>RotateMe
(07:43:06)<the_ru>can you compile this http://pastebin.com/d1be4debe
(07:43:10)<the_ru>and give me the output?
(07:47:07)<the_ru>(and anyone else, if you feel like it - it's always good to know the code works on many systems)
(08:04:41)<RotateMe>under ubuntu?
(08:04:44)<RotateMe>or win vista?
(08:18:50)<RotateMe>(ubuntu i'd guess)
(08:22:08)<the_ru>Ubuntu

(01:02:40)<oeb>Also, why is it not working? Just not effective?
(01:03:05)<the_ru>well; the shield points are depleted
(01:03:29)<the_ru>you have to regain them by waiting a turn
(01:03:41)<the_ru>to represent the concentration it takes to keep the shield up
(01:03:46)<oeb>An alternate method might be as follows. There is a block % gained through the skill and modified for larger sheilds. If you have directional damage this only applies to the front.
(01:04:00)<the_ru>that's what I used earlier
(01:04:04)<the_ru>(except directional damage)
(01:04:14)<oeb>Each sheild then has a % chance of blocking the attack completely, otherwise you take a % of the damage
(01:04:15)<the_ru>but I wanted it to be more interactive
(01:04:53)<the_ru>e.g. a 50% blocking shield will just halve the damage you take
(01:05:05)<the_ru>there's no *player* skill involved
(01:05:12)<oeb>Not using the method suggested above
(01:05:40)<oeb>a 50% blocking shild may be 70% for someone who specialised in sheilds to make a tank fighter
(01:05:52)<oeb>Or may be 30% in another.
(01:05:58)<the_ru>yeah, but it's still just something you put on
(01:06:07)<the_ru>I want to create more tension
(01:06:17)<oeb>I think you might be in danger of over complicating things.
(01:06:24)<the_ru>probably
(01:06:27)<oeb>Fight rest fight rest fight rest.
(01:06:52)<the_ru>the idea was that you could fight like a coward and just rest all the time
(01:07:00)<oeb>I think micromanagement like that would create the posibility of a tedious roguelike. That's just my opinion though.
(01:07:12)<the_ru>if you have good enough shield skill, you could avoid getting hurt at all
(01:07:19)<oeb>An alternate method to that could be to have a users AC vary over time.
(01:08:00)<the_ru>the problem is: the "Block" bar is either empty, giving the player very little feedback on how much was actually blocked, or too full, that no enemies succeed in hurting you at all
(01:08:23)<the_ru>but, how about a compromise
(01:08:42)<the_ru>shields have both a block percentage and a number of uses
(01:09:03)<oeb>Just give them a smash chance on succesful block.
(01:09:06)<the_ru>a medium-sized shield could have 2 uses and 40% block
(01:09:51)<oeb>It's a bit too black and white that way.
(01:09:55)<the_ru>if you have uses left, and roll below the block percentage, you block
(01:10:05)<the_ru>but for each successful block, you lose one use
(01:10:16)<the_ru>that you then have to regain by waiting
(01:10:39)<oeb>Should the wait not apply to all armour thought?
(01:10:53)<the_ru>why?
(01:11:06)<the_ru>you just wear the armor, but the shield takes some skill to use
(01:11:11)<oeb>Defensiveness is not gained by wearing a metal suit and relying on blows to hit it. You parry, you dodge, you deflect.
(01:11:19)<oeb>You don't just stand there and take hits.
(01:11:32)<oeb>If you are tired, even in full plate you are easier to take down.
(01:11:45)<the_ru>well, my armor works in a non-standard way
(01:11:53)<the_ru>they just give a HP bonus, no damage reduction
(01:12:01)<oeb>Also, what about bucklers or other 'worn' sheilds? They are alot smaller and alot easier to use.
(01:12:27)<oeb>What if someone is close to dead and they put on plate mail. Take a couple of hits then switch to leather. Do they die?
(01:12:35)<the_ru>heavy armor also gives penalties to speed, dodge and stealth
(01:12:53)<the_ru>they increase the max HP
(01:12:57)<oeb>Do you have a magic system? Does armour effect that?
(01:13:09)<the_ru>if you're wearing plate, you can take a few more hits than with leather
(01:13:22)<the_ru>no, it doesn't affect magic
(01:13:23)<oeb>Ohh ok, so if I have 5/20 hp and put on plate the only difference is that I have 5/30 hp now?
(01:13:28)<the_ru>yes
(01:13:51)<the_ru>changing equipment in the middle of combat doesn't make sense :-)
(01:13:58)<oeb>Interesting system, although I don't think it acurately reflects how armour works.
(01:14:21)<oeb>Although it does allow for a much quicker learning curve, which is nice for an rl
(01:14:22)<the_ru>probably not - but I think any system that would would be too complicated
(01:14:37)<the_ru>it's just "with armor you can take more damage"
(01:15:29)<the_ru>I know that "using" armor properly takes some skill, but even if you're not trained with armor, wearing plate will still protect you more than leather
(01:15:29)<oeb>Armour could be used as a buffer too, depending on the armour % chance of the armour taking 90% of the damage rather than you. When an armour takes it's hp worth it's damaged.
(01:15:37)<oeb>That is true.
(01:15:56)<the_ru>it takes damage now - the same amount that your HP take
(01:16:03)<oeb>And breaks?
(01:16:05)<the_ru>yes
(01:16:14)<oeb>Do your weapons break too?
(01:16:17)<the_ru>not yet
(01:16:21)<oeb>Will they?
(01:16:27)<the_ru>maybe
(01:16:36)<the_ru>I haven't decided exactly how it should work
(01:16:39)<oeb>Sounds like a fun RL, everything could be a depleteable resource.
(01:16:52)<the_ru>it should be possible to maintain weapons, sharpen them etc
(01:17:06)<the_ru>and it should be possible to repair armor
(01:17:17)<oeb>You could have 'unbreakable' artifacts, or 'nigh-unbreakable' materials.
(01:17:19)<the_ru>but I'm not bothering with those skills for now
(01:17:23)<TMC>bike tyre repair kits
(01:17:37)<the_ru>I have indestructible items already
(01:17:55)<the_ru>the only thing that doesn't make sense is in water - they float instead of just sinking
(01:17:57)<oeb>The problem with repairs is time scale, repairing plate would take weeks. Reforging a sword is not something you could do over night. I suppose you could tie it to the magic system though.
(01:18:17)<the_ru>yeah
(01:18:39)<the_ru>but to be playable, it'd just be an "apply hammer to armor" action :-)
(01:18:55)<oeb>Yes, but it's a magic hammer =P
(01:19:04)<the_ru>but those are barely in planning stage yet
(01:19:19)<oeb>You going tiled or ascii?
(01:19:25)<the_ru>ASCII
(01:19:35)<the_ru>with a few extended characters
(01:20:13)<oeb>I dunno why, but some games I like ascii, some I hate it.
(01:20:30)<oeb>Can't stand playing nethack without tiles, can't stand playing crawl WITH tiles =P
(01:24:33)<TMC>it's what you're used to/started playing with?
(01:27:06)<the_ru>Crawl-style walls certainly seem to be the most popular these days
(01:27:16)<the_ru>Crawl/ADOM
(01:27:19)<the_ru>probably others as well
(01:32:22)<oeb>What do you think is the most accessible roguelike? I mean something that helps people get into the genre?
(01:33:04)<oeb>I think there are quite few examples that display enough of the attributes without being either brutal or not having enough replayability?
(01:34:28)<the_ru>Angband?
(01:34:44)<oeb>I think something like DoomRL would be a good game to get new player into the scene.
(01:34:59)<the_ru>It's slow-paced, quite simple in the beginnig
(01:35:16)<oeb>(Just passing around the idea of a 'guide to roguelikes' website, the whole idea would be to bring new players into it.
(01:35:17)<the_ru>and it will be very familiar to anyone that has played Diablo
(01:35:36)<oeb>Never actually played angband. Just never got around to it.
(01:35:57)<the_ru>Nethack has its issues
(01:35:57)<oeb>For some reason I kept away from all the 'band varients.
(01:36:12)<the_ru>ADOM is very complex sometimes
(01:36:20)<oeb>Nethack is overly complex for new players imho, too many quirks.
(01:36:47)<the_ru>The many races/classes in Crawl are probably dangerous for newbies
(01:36:53)<oeb>There is too many things you can do with anything.
(01:37:20)<oeb>Something like powder is simple enough. It is quite complex but the complexity can be ignored and you can still win.
(01:37:31)<the_ru>they often end up thinking "oh, that combination sounds cool" and pick a totally lame character, get killed and get frustrated
(01:38:00)<oeb>Gerry Quinns game (Lair of the deamon ape) is pretty straight forward too.
(01:38:09)<the_ru>haven't tried it
(01:38:20)<oeb>It may be a bit overly simplistic thought.
(01:38:20)<the_ru>I don't have much time to play, if I want to develop as well :-/
(01:38:28)<oeb>There is like 3 classes, quite few items.
(01:38:48)<oeb>See I procrastinate =P
(01:39:03)<the_ru>OTOH, the complexity is what most of us appreciate about them
(01:39:19)<the_ru>so suggesting one that's too simple might be counterproductive :-)
(01:39:29)<the_ru>most people are just not meant to play them
(01:39:48)<oeb>I know, but that makes the genre less accessible to new players, I am looking at the possibility of setting up a site specificially for new players.
(01:42:03)<the_ru>is such a thing needed?
(01:42:18)<the_ru>those that are interested ought to find their way on their own
(01:43:04)<oeb>I think more players encourage more development / developers. That in turn increases the quality of the genre.
(01:43:23)<oeb>Or maybe I just want to share some of the best games I have ever played with other people?
(01:54:24)<the_ru>I've changed my shields now
(01:54:36)<the_ru>they have both a block chance and a maximum number of blocks
(01:54:48)<the_ru>so it's mostly automatic
(01:55:11)<the_ru>but if you get surrounded, you won't have time to keep the shield up against everyone
(01:56:04)<the_ru>e.g. after you've taken 3 hits, you have to either wait a turn or back away for your shield to become effective again
(01:58:12)<the_ru>would it make sense if larger shields have a higher chance of blocking, but fewer blocks?
(01:58:31)<the_ru>they protect you better, but you have to spend more time on shield use
(02:00:17)<TMC>well....
(02:00:43)<TMC>what about not being able to block 2 attacks coming from opposite directions
(02:00:43)<the_ru>when carrying a large shield, you're also slower - if fighting multiple enemies, *someone* can always get behind you
(02:01:07)<the_ru>while with a small buckler, you cover less percentage of your body, but are more mobile...
(02:01:10)<the_ru>hm
(02:01:13)<the_ru>how would that work?
(02:01:34)<TMC>how long is a turn?
(02:02:14)<TMC>it might be unrealistic to be able to swing a sheild around to block 3 simultaneous attacks, all while presumably attacking back
(02:02:29)<the_ru>yes, but how would I track it?
(02:02:43)<the_ru>and how would I give feedback to the player what's going on?
(02:03:00)<TMC>"The blob hits you in the back!"
(02:03:09)<TMC>hmm.that implies more damage
(02:03:20)<TMC>I mean, bonus damage
(02:03:23)<the_ru>that implies facing, that I don't have
(02:03:27)<TMC>not what we wanted
(02:03:39)<TMC>hmmm
(02:03:57)<the_ru>I already have backstabbing
(02:04:06)<the_ru>or "surprise attack!" as I call them for some reason
(02:04:09)<TMC>hmmmm
(02:04:35)<TMC>"The blob evades your sheild to hit"
(02:04:54)<TMC>or... why give specific feedback
(02:05:15)<TMC>the player will notice soon enough that second attack from behind are never blocked
(02:05:31)<TMC>attacks from opposite directions
(02:05:33)<the_ru>that's pretty much what I
(02:05:36)<the_ru>I'm doing now
(02:05:54)<the_ru>if I have 1 block point, and get hit, the second attack will always hit
(02:06:02)<the_ru>always hit/never be blocked
(02:06:10)<the_ru>there's still a chance the enemy *misses*, of course
(02:06:38)<the_ru>that's what I'm thinking about large shields having fewer blocks
(02:07:20)<the_ru>a smaller shield is faster to move around, but the enemy is more likely to strike past it
(02:07:38)<TMC>it's a reasonable enough system
(02:10:39)<the_ru>if you need to move down a corridor while being bombarded by enemy missiles, you can just put up a tower shield
(02:10:56)<the_ru>even if you only get 1 or 2 blocks with it, it's enough if you wait every other turn
(02:12:01)<TMC>but a tower shield should be great against a large number of projectiles too
(02:12:11)<TMC>assuming they're all coming from the same direction
(02:12:44)<the_ru>that situation won't happen
(02:12:53)<the_ru>enemies can't shoot past each other
(02:13:00)<TMC>heh, ok
(02:13:10)<TMC>I guess you don't ahve diagonal projectiles
(02:13:20)<the_ru>I do, but in a corridor
(02:13:25)<the_ru>there are no diagonals
(02:13:26)<the_ru>:-)
(02:13:49)<the_ru>and if we're getting projectiles from both sides, even a tower shield is no good anymore
(02:13:55)<TMC>yeah... I was talking in general
(02:15:11)<the_ru>yeah, I get the idea
(02:15:58)<the_ru>of course, I could have facing and different number of blocks for projectiles and melee... but then it wouldn't be a roguelike, it would be a shield simulator
(02:16:38)<the_ru>Final Fantasy Tactics comes to mind - at the end of your turn, you have to select a facing
(02:17:00)<the_ru>and you take different damage depending on what direction the enemy strikes from
(02:20:03)<TMC>roguelikes aer meant to be complex :P
(02:21:07)<TMC>I think making being attacked from opposite sides worse than being attacked from the same general direction is a good thing, adding to tactics
(02:22:05)<TMC>the player wouldn't need to know exactly how it works, just that it acts fairly realistically
(02:22:26)<TMC>however, your system is already a nice improvement
(02:23:14)<TMC>(and, I think facing in rl's would be bad. you don't have to add a facing direction, just track attack directions)
(02:27:25)<oeb>Something like a tower sheild is not used in the same way as a round shild
(02:27:57)<oeb>You would pretty much fight around your tower sheild, space conciderations stop you raising it above your head etc.
(02:28:33)<oeb>That being said a tower sheild is ineffective with anything other than a stabbing weapon anyway.
(02:28:45)<oeb>No room to use a chopping weapon.
(02:31:09)<oeb>Speaking of Powder, has anyone got an email address for Jeff? There is none on his site and his usenet one looks fake.
(02:49:03)<the_ru>"Heavy infantry: This was the principal unit of the legion. The heavy infantry was composed of citizen legionaries that could afford the equipment composed of an iron helmet, shield, armour and pilum, a heavy javelin whose range was about 30 meters. After 387 the preferred weapon for the hastati and principes was the gladius, a short sword."
(02:49:23)<the_ru>hm
(02:49:28)<the_ru>oh, it doesn't actually say tower shield
(02:50:48)<oeb>Same kinda sheild
(02:51:10)<oeb>Also the gladius was primerally a stabbing weapon.
(02:51:41)<oeb>The large sheilds were not effective for anything other than closely ranked infantary.
(02:51:47)<the_ru>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutum_%28shield%29
(02:51:54)<oeb>They are too cumbersome to manuver effectivly.
(02:52:01)<the_ru>probably
(02:52:17)<oeb>Also they were used by archers, there were people whos job it was to hold the big sheild in front of the archer
(02:52:39)<the_ru>"did you have a rough day at work, honey?"
(02:53:18)<the_ru>I'm not sure what combinations of weapons, shields and bows to allow
(02:53:32)<the_ru>how about:
(02:53:35)<the_ru>2-handed weapon
(02:53:41)<the_ru>1-handed weapon (with or without shield)
(02:53:45)<oeb>It was also unlikely that anything remotely like the giant sheilds pictured on sword bearing knights in fantasy artwork were ever used.
(02:53:49)<the_ru>2 x 1-handed weapon (dual-wielding)
(02:53:53)<the_ru>1-handed weapon + bow
(02:54:00)<oeb>That's pretty standard.
(02:54:52)<the_ru>it feels like the use of shields is quite overrated
(02:55:49)<oeb>Offer specialised uses for sheilds, like diablo 2 does.
(02:56:20)<the_ru>I'm not sure how it did it
(02:56:22)<oeb>For example a bash skill that gives you a chance of stunning an enemy, offer sheilds that provide bonuses to this.
(02:56:25)<the_ru>I just played a sorceress
(02:56:32)<the_ru>A-ha
(02:56:38)<oeb>A charge skill that is used to knock back an enemy etc
(02:57:06)<the_ru>BBL
(02:57:10)<the_ru>Gotta change tires
(03:00:49)<TMC>funny cat
(03:01:04)<oeb>Your cat or one with tires?
(03:01:34)<TMC>likes to scratch at my door, not because it wants to be let in, but because it plays with it like a toy
(03:01:50)<oeb>haa haa, cat's can be odd sometimes

(12:29:05)<TMC>no one builds 1x4 room "buildings"
(12:29:43)<the_ru>right
(12:30:33)<the_ru>it would make much more sense then to re-use the neighbours wall, and just add three more walls to build your own room
(12:32:31)<deveah>well yes
(12:32:51)<deveah>but if you're making a medieval alien city, it does the job quite well
(12:32:59)<deveah>*retard alien
(12:33:48)<the_ru>also; building without plan doesn't result in straight streets
(12:34:07)<the_ru>I wonder if I'm approaching this from the wrong direction
(12:34:27)<the_ru>I'm using a modified version of my "split rooms" algorithm, but I place streets between the rooms instead
(12:36:43)<deveah>what year does your game take place in?
(12:37:47)<TMC>it sounds like the wrong algorithm to get what you want
(12:37:56)<the_ru>deveah: middle ages, I guess
(12:38:08)<the_ru>possibly earlier
(12:38:59)<the_ru>perhaps I should split it into city planning, that allocates blocks and builds the official buildings (that have some kind of plan)
(12:39:14)<the_ru>then let another more organic algorithm fill out the area inbetween
(12:44:42)<the_ru>or I could just let the organic algorithm build first, then the city planners will just tear down the area they want to build on :-)
(12:45:11)<TMC>the second would be less trouble :P
(12:47:18)<the_ru>I don't like building things without boundaries though :-/
(12:47:48)<the_ru>it's much easier if I decide upon an area that I pass to my functions and say "here, build here"
(01:07:43)<deveah>i find it difficult to make a split-rooms algorithm
(01:07:51)<the_ru>why?
(01:07:59)<deveah>dunno
(01:08:07)<the_ru>did you even try?
(01:08:10)<deveah>i've tried several times, but didn't work
(01:08:14)<the_ru>a-ha
(01:08:21)<the_ru>what's wrong, then?
(01:08:32)<deveah>i use something like this:
(01:08:41)<deveah>1. make base shape (of level)
(01:09:02)<deveah>2. pick random x and y vars, and another e var (end position)
(01:09:53)<deveah>3. if there isn't a wall on position x,y or on position x,e (for vertical) / e,y (horizontal), jump back to step 2
(01:10:12)<deveah>4. if it's ok, make a line of walls using the good coordinates
(01:10:20)<the_ru>you're doing it wrong
(01:10:25)<deveah>:/
(01:10:26)<the_ru>the key is proper use of recursion
(01:11:06)<the_ru>make a function that takes a coordinate pair and a length in each direction
(01:11:10)<the_ru>like t, l, h, w
(01:11:30)<the_ru>then you split either h or w in two, and call the function again
(01:11:56)<the_ru>that way, you'll always know what area you're allowed to build on
(01:12:14)<the_ru>once you get to the desired room size (5x5?), you clear that area to floor tiles, and return
(01:12:22)<deveah>as a c++ n00b, i might ask what should i compile - .h or .c files?
(01:12:28)<TMC>.c
(01:12:31)<deveah>oh
(01:12:32)<deveah>thanks
(01:12:52)<the_ru>actually, you will compile .h as well - but those are included from the .cs
(01:13:51)<TMC>well you could always include .c files in a .h :P
(01:14:00)<the_ru>I used to do that (!)
(01:14:12)<TMC>hehehe
(01:14:24)<TMC>shouldn't you include .c files from other .c files?
(01:14:50)<the_ru>why?
(01:15:26)<TMC>...something about object code
(01:15:26)<the_ru>you should be able to compile each .c file separately - the things that need to be shared between them should be in the headers
(01:15:48)<the_ru>then it's up to the linker to figure out how to put them together
(01:15:56)<deveah>i'll wait for highschool for c++ ....
(01:15:58)<TMC>some peop-le might be too lazy to use macros
(01:16:20)<the_ru>deveah: no. right now is the best time to learn it
(01:16:52)<deveah>i have 3 books of ~600 pages each, but I only read how to output some vars to the console
(01:17:05)<the_ru>I'd recommend learning C before C++ anyway
(01:17:32)<the_ru>you won't be able to make use of most of the features of C++ at first anyway
(01:17:53)<the_ru>so you'll just try to apply them to the wrong situation, get frustrated and give up
(01:17:59)<the_ru>(at least that's what happened to me)
(01:18:02)<TMC>and it helps you to see the bad features of c++ :P
(01:18:05)<deveah>the synthax is familiar to me, i've been working on php for over a year now and i'ce succesfully made some blog engines and a simple site-maker
(01:18:30)<TMC>or, bad use of
(01:19:03)<the_ru>you have to write a few thousand lines of code before the benefits of OO start to show
(01:19:22)<deveah>oh, only a few?
(01:20:24)<the_ru>depends on your project, of course
(01:21:34)<the_ru>you must keep in mind that OO is just a tool, it's not a complete solution
(01:21:36)<the_ru>it
(01:21:37)<the_ru>it
(01:21:56)<the_ru>it's *much* more important to learn software design than any specific programming method
(01:22:40)<deveah>LOLCODE ftw!
(01:24:21)<deveah>i have successfully made a hello world thingie in cpp
(01:24:53)<the_ru>with streams?
(01:26:01)<TMC>I thought you were learning C
(01:26:15)<deveah>with printf and stdio.h :D
(01:26:27)<the_ru>then you're essentially writing C code
(01:26:40)<deveah>yep
(01:27:01)<deveah>cpp synthax is more clear than basic's
(01:27:40)<deveah>not easier
(01:27:52)<TMC>yes :)
(01:28:06)<the_ru>it's more consistent, that makes it easier
(01:29:23)<the_ru>For To Step Next - what
(01:29:34)<the_ru>who wants to memorize that structure
(01:30:04)<deveah>well you don't have to really
(01:30:08)<TMC>after years of basic, I still can't remember all the forms of while loops
(01:30:22)<deveah>basic is like telegraphic english
(01:30:28)<TMC>there's WHILE foo : bar : WEND
(01:30:37)<TMC>DO : foo : WHILE bar
(01:30:44)<TMC>DO : foo : UNTIL bar
(01:30:46)<TMC>I think
(01:30:50)<the_ru>although do { } while(); in C isn't the clearest either
(01:30:51)<TMC>some other ones
(01:31:14)<TMC>yeah, I suppose
(01:31:21)<the_ru>but in BASIC, every keyword is a special case :-)
(01:31:26)<TMC>I nearly never use it and forget it exists
(01:31:35)<deveah>i often use do-while in fb
(01:31:49)<TMC>well me too
(01:31:56)<TMC>but I still couldn't remember it yesteday
(01:32:51)<deveah>i use something like
(01:32:57)<the_ru>if you're serious about programming, you should learn as much as possible when you
(01:33:02)<the_ru>while you're young
(01:33:20)<deveah>do { rl actions } loop until multikey(1) = until ESC is pressed
(01:33:23)<TMC>really? you think it's important to be young? 
(01:33:27)<the_ru>yeah
(01:33:48)<the_ru>or actually, it's important to have free time
(01:33:49)<the_ru>but that
(01:33:58)<the_ru>that's usually a luxury reserved for youth
(01:35:45)<deveah>i've found a chapter in the book that makes a simple briefing about a native cpp-curses or something
(01:36:34)<deveah>printf("\033[44m"); makes the background blue
(01:37:37)<deveah>or it should
(01:37:57)<the_ru>burn that book
(01:38:19)<deveah>why?
(01:38:22)<TMC>hahaha
(01:38:23)<the_ru>if it's teaching things like that
(01:38:32)<deveah>it needs an ANSI driver btw
(01:38:55)<the_ru>ever heard of platform independence?
(01:39:09)<deveah>oh, this is win-only...
(01:39:19)<TMC>there's a lot of terrible C and C++ books out there
(01:39:24)<TMC>I have several
(01:39:29)<TMC>(and no good ones :( )
(01:39:56)<TMC>several ... 1 or 2
(01:40:08)<deveah>well this \033 stuff stinks - it doesn
(01:40:13)<deveah>'t work on my win
(01:40:21)<TMC>how interesting
(01:40:34)<TMC>go use curses
(01:40:56)<deveah>hahahahhaha
(01:41:17)<deveah>will it make my proggie 100k bigger?
(01:41:54)<the_ru>not if you link it dynamically
(01:42:15)<TMC>well there should be some native API for manipulating the console if you really want to spit in the face of portability
(01:42:29)<the_ru>conio.h
(01:43:30)<deveah>well i'm aiming at windows and small filesize...
(01:44:11)<the_ru>then you should be using assembly
(01:44:17)<TMC>sounds useless
(01:44:37)<deveah>cpp is hard for me, what do you want me to do?
(01:44:40)<deveah>use asm?
(01:44:48)<TMC>YES
(01:44:59)<TMC>write a RL in 4096 bytes

(01:49:09)<TMC>wow, a raytracer...
(01:54:32)<TMC>wow.

(02:13:17)<deveah>it hit him
(03:54:54)<the_ru>Hm
(03:55:06)<the_ru>I'm not really getting anywhere with my city
(03:55:26)<the_ru>I also realised I want it to have a harbor - another thing to consider
(03:55:50)<the_ru>Perhaps I should just design it by hand
(03:56:00)<the_ru>maybe put some random blocks of houses in there somewhere
(04:01:01)<TMC>quakenet must die
(04:01:19)<the_ru>what did it do to you?
(04:45:57)<TMC>quakenet must die
(04:46:09)<TMC>seriously why can't I stay connected for more than 60 seconds
(04:46:38)<the_ru>what is this grudge that you hold... for this "quakenet" as you call it
(04:48:28)<TMC>Perhaps you call it the devil's IRC network?
(04:50:06)<TMC>probably the fact that mirc won't stop disobeying, and connecting to norwegian servers
(04:50:49)<jraregris>i prefer norwegian servers
(04:51:00)<jraregris>but then again i live in norway, so it makes perfect sense

(10:55:24)<RotateMe>("realisieren" in german != realize in english)
(10:55:39)<the_ru>yes, I understood what you meant :-)
(10:55:42)<RotateMe>i just played Romancing Saga for PS2
(10:55:49)<RotateMe>it has a buttload of good ideas
(10:56:05)<RotateMe>sometimes overly complex but that's okay with me
(10:56:37)<the_ru>what is it? RPG in the japanese school?
(10:57:11)<RotateMe>yep but very untypical
(10:57:49)<RotateMe>the first one is, that it's actually hard :D
(10:58:20)<RotateMe>unlike 95% of all jrpgs, where you can pretty much win the game by walking around and pressing x during the fights
(10:58:50)<the_ru>I bought a PS last week
(10:58:57)<the_ru>so I have a few of those to go through :-/
(11:01:03)<RotateMe>PS 1 or 2?
(11:02:23)<the_ru>not even a PS1... the initial PS :-)
(11:21:16)<RotateMe>then the obvious choice would be final fantasy VII
(11:21:34)<the_ru>I have the PC version, so it's quite low priority right now
(11:21:42)<the_ru>I haven't played FF8 though
(11:25:00)<RotateMe>it's not a glimpse as good as 7 but it's still good
(11:25:29)<RotateMe>wild arms is pretty neat aside from it's battle system
(11:26:59)<the_ru>I still think FF6 is the best
(11:27:18)<the_ru>FF5 was very interesting as well, but it doesn't have as much story
(11:28:48)<RotateMe>5 was awesome
(11:29:01)<RotateMe>for some reason i never played 6 for more than 2 hours
(11:29:18)<RotateMe>the story of 7 is pure gold imo
(11:30:46)<the_ru>I didn't like it much
(11:30:57)<the_ru>and Advent Children was crap :-(
(11:32:52)<RotateMe>yep
(11:33:20)<the_ru>I'm playing Symphony of the Night right now
(11:33:27)<RotateMe>i might like it so much beacuse i played it when i was pretty young
(11:33:34)<RotateMe>ah that's awesome too
(11:33:51)<the_ru>I don't understand why they always have the least satisfying ending as default in these games
(11:34:13)<the_ru>same thing with Aria of Sorrow
(11:34:21)<the_ru>finished it - "was that it?"
(11:34:31)<the_ru>no, had to check a walkthrough to find out I missed like half the game :-/
(11:36:30)<RotateMe>yeah that's not cool. i think they fixed this in the latest ds game
(11:36:42)<RotateMe>but i'm not sure
(11:37:51)<the_ru>and I think the difficulty is very unbalanced
(11:38:03)<the_ru>in SotN, I have absolutely no problem at all beating the bosses
(11:38:09)<the_ru>but I can't find my way!
(11:38:39)<the_ru>at one point I went through every room in the castle twice, until I realised a save room had exits in *both* directions
(11:40:03)<the_ru>I started with Circle of the Moon, I still think that's the best one
(11:40:22)<the_ru>Harmony of Dissonance was also very frustrating to get through
(11:40:40)<the_ru>and Aria of Sorrow was too short
(11:40:46)<RotateMe>i just played aria of sorrow
(11:41:35)<the_ru>and I don't understand why they insist on having attributes
(11:41:42)<the_ru>is it just to appease JRPG fans...
(11:42:31)<the_ru>and the shop system(s) aren't really useful - you can buy some stuff, and sometimes sell some, but it's not that useful after all
(11:42:42)<RotateMe>yeah for people like me :D
(11:42:51)<RotateMe>i like this stuff because it has always been there
(11:43:10)<RotateMe>but you're right, the stuff should make sense
(11:43:43)<the_ru>the relics are cool, because they give abilities that are immediately visible
(11:43:45)<RotateMe>Romancing Saga for example has a very good shop system, just because of the fact that it's HARD to make money
(11:43:59)<the_ru>but the attributes - what difference does it make if I have 18 or 19 strength?
(11:44:29)<RotateMe>yep, that's only making sense in very difficult turn based rpgs
(11:45:01)<RotateMe>where you can't win with 18 but can with 19 ^^

(07:42:24)<joe6pack> so what happened while i was gone?
(07:58:21)<deveah>well i got back

(08:34:42)<RotateMe>good to see some new faces
(08:34:53)<RotateMe>you're developing a roguelike too?
(08:36:30)<DerShcraa>not really, the only thing i managed to do yet is drawing a rectangle of dots in c#
(08:37:33)<RotateMe>well I couldn't do this in C#
(08:37:41)<RotateMe>i wouldn't know how to start ...
(08:37:57)<RotateMe>are there graphics libraries for C#? like SDL or sth
(08:38:15)<deveah>SDL is universal
(08:38:23)<deveah>it MUST be smth for csharp
(08:39:07)<RotateMe>rly?
(08:39:08)<RotateMe>nice
(08:39:23)<DerShcraa>well, i just "drew" on an array of chars
(08:40:08)<RotateMe>okay ... well that's your first dungeon room
(08:40:19)<RotateMe>just put some monsters and items in there and you're finished
(08:40:20)<RotateMe>:D
(08:40:37)<RotateMe>deveah: I just read that you didn't like elona (in the log)
(08:40:40)<RotateMe>why?
(08:40:58)<RotateMe>the graphics are a bit inconsistent but i found it had very rich gameplay
(08:41:01)<deveah>because of the size
(08:41:13)<RotateMe>the char size sucked, yes :(
(08:41:29)<RotateMe>the first versions had one field sized chars and it looked awesome
(08:41:33)<deveah>a roguelike is for me a small game that can be played in coffeebreaks
(08:42:28)<RotateMe>ah that's what you meant
(08:42:43)<RotateMe>yeah seemed pretty massive content wise
(08:42:50)<RotateMe>so i guess you don't like adom either?
(08:43:05)<deveah>adom?
(08:43:09)<deveah>w8
(08:43:22)<deveah>1,96 mb?
(08:43:29)<deveah>well i played it
(08:44:05)<RotateMe>okay i got you wrong again ^^
(08:44:23)<RotateMe>thought you meant the content size
(08:44:36)<RotateMe>file size was inacceptable
(08:44:55)<RotateMe>the pictures were bmp and there was *shudder* sound
(08:44:55)<deveah>file size is what i mean
(08:45:13)<deveah>for example, i very much liked The Curse (40 kb and very contenty)
(08:45:21)<Kadwiell>Uncompressed bmp? Eww
(08:45:21)<deveah>cya later
(08:47:02)<Kadwiell>Not hugely important of course, but there's no real reason to tax players' hard drives unnecessarily
(08:49:42)<RotateMe>yeah but i guess ~70mb is nothing for today's standard player

(08:47:15)<deveah>i don't think so
(08:47:26)<joe6pack>alas, it is true
(08:47:28)<deveah>whole Romania is using win
(08:47:56)<joe6pack>romania might not be representative of the computing world as a whole
(08:48:05)<joe6pack>also,
(08:48:06)<deveah>do you guys have some id-s on other networks?
(08:48:26)<joe6pack>id-s?
(08:48:53)<deveah>id
(08:49:16)<deveah>plural of id is ids, but to mark the plural i added -
(08:49:22)<joe6pack>oh ok
(08:49:32)<joe6pack>you mean irc networks?
(08:49:38)<deveah>no
(08:49:46)<deveah>yahoo, msn, icq, gadugadu

(08:55:08)<the_ru>And who do I need to IM with that I can't find on IRC or reach via mail?
(08:57:18)<deveah>all Romania is on Yahoo!
(08:58:36)<the_ru>it seems like all of Romania is on Undernet as well

(09:11:48)<the_ru>yes
(09:12:20)<the_ru>I think people often get me wrong
(09:13:01)<the_ru>just because I'm interested in computers I'm not interested in fixing Windows problems
(09:13:21)<the_ru>I don't even know modern Windows well anymore

(09:13:42)<the_ru>:-(
(09:13:44)<joe6pack>the_ru: people often ask me to multiply/divide/add large numbers after hearing i study math
(09:14:04)<the_ru>...
(09:14:21)<the_ru>so what is the square root of 60020?
(09:14:27)<the_ru>:-P
(09:14:30)<joe6pack>apparently they think mathematicians multiply large numbers in their head all day 
(09:16:34)<the_ru>I should get one of those "no, I won't fix your computer" t-shirts

(07:03:58)<deveah>visual basic
(07:04:26)<purestrain>horrible ?
(07:09:03)<joe6pack>cr 1.0 is officially out 
(07:09:20)<joe6pack>i just packed all the changed since the 7drl and put it on the website 
(07:09:31)<joe6pack>s/changed/changes

(07:29:39)<the_ru>but it won't do in the long run
(07:29:45)<joe6pack>i think there was at least one rl made in it
(07:29:47)<the_ru>portability = 0
(07:29:53)<joe6pack>the_ru: why not?
(07:53:32)<deveah>Numbers, Saffron, Paprika - all made in VB
(07:58:46)<RotateMe>"cannot declare member function `static void CharContent::initChars()' to have static linkage"

(07:59:46)<purestrain>static is only required in definition, afaik
(08:00:53)<RotateMe>ah okay thanks
(08:03:00)<deveah>joe6pack: about the 1.0 version - add another space character before the second key mapping \|/
(08:04:23)<joe6pack>?
(08:04:49)<deveah>it's not centered correctly :p
(08:04:59)<joe6pack>oh yea
(08:07:40)<deveah>and correct the "feal healthy"
(08:08:20)<joe6pack>where?
(08:08:35)<deveah>in the game
(08:08:42)<joe6pack>...
(08:08:48)<joe6pack>where in the game?

(10:23:19)<the_ru>I had an idea for my previous RL attempt about a fortress in the mountain
(10:23:33)<the_ru>depending on where you entered it from, you would end up on different ends of the map
(10:24:00)<the_ru>perhaps I should re-implement it in TSL
(10:24:38)<the_ru>what if the player is a wanted criminal? fight the guards (and get an even higher bounty on your head) or find another (much longer) way around?
(10:25:06)<the_ru>or sneak through at night, when shadows abound?

(12:12:25)<the_ru>hah
(12:12:26)<the_ru>it works
(12:12:47)<the_ru>I'm adding functionality for my overworld locations to have different entry and exit points
(12:13:38)<the_ru>each area can have several entry points
(12:14:06)<the_ru>on the overworld
(12:14:31)<the_ru>and when leaving an area, the game checks in which direction
(12:14:44)<the_ru>so if you walk north, you appear north of the location on the world map
(12:15:24)<the_ru>it will allow me to seal off areas so that you always zoom in to the local map when you move through them
(12:15:38)<the_ru>e.g. the fortress I mentioned earlier
(12:15:59)<the_ru>it's in a mountain pass, so you can only leave and enter to the north/south
(12:16:12)<the_ru>and you actually have to walk through the fortress to get to the other side
(01:13:43)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.11-gemar.png
(01:13:51)<the_ru>entering the fortress, from the south
(01:14:03)<the_ru>I wonder though how I can make it look more like an actual fortress and less like a cave
(02:01:16)<TMCAwry>imposing walls!
(02:01:47)<TMCAwry>it barely has walls at all

(06:05:07)<TMC>hi
+++ Start of log: Sat May 10 09:04:32 CEST 2008 +++
(10:03:14)<the_ru>TMC: the two tile wide wall there is supposed to be the wall
(10:03:24)<the_ru>after the two pillars
(10:05:32)<TMC>I kno
(10:05:33)<TMC>w
(10:05:44)<TMC>(didn't realise it was 2 tiles)
(10:06:01)<TMC>still, it doesn't look very impressive
(10:06:06)<the_ru>I know
(10:06:17)<TMC>maybe you could have a double wall
(10:06:20)<the_ru>what if I add 5x5 tile guard towers around the gate?
(10:06:25)<TMC>some kind of fortifications!
(10:06:43)<TMC>sounds good
(10:07:14)<TMC>the regular rooms right behind the wall make it look a bit insignificant
(10:07:33)<the_ru>they're not really rooms, they're houses
(10:09:41)<the_ru>perhaps I could have rows of pillars on the inside?
(10:09:50)<the_ru>to give it a more "official" feeling
(10:10:00)<the_ru>it would leave very little room for the houses though
(10:10:35)<the_ru>or I could make it wider, but shorter
(10:12:23)<TMC>you can't make the map bigger?
(10:12:56)<the_ru>yes
(10:13:01)<the_ru>that's what I'm pondering
(10:13:12)<the_ru>but I like when it's just scrolling in one direction
(10:13:16)<the_ru>in this case vertically
(10:14:33)<joe6pack>the_ru: link?
(10:14:58)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.11-gemar.png
(10:15:09)<the_ru>it's a fortress you have to walk through
(10:15:27)<TMC>oh, you mean rows of pillars all the way through the fort?
(10:15:35)<the_ru>it's barred by mountains on all sides on the overworld
(10:15:49)<the_ru>so to get to the northern side, you have to enter from the south and walk through
(10:15:51)<the_ru>TMC: yes
(10:16:20)<joe6pack>like the parthenon or something
(10:16:35)<TMC>hmm
(10:16:44)<the_ru>but OTOH, how much sense would that make fortification-wise
(10:16:49)<joe6pack>i would also put 2 statues at the entry
(10:16:52)<TMC>well I just suggest more fortifications
(10:16:56)<joe6pack>one of the left and one of the right
(10:17:03)<the_ru>they ought to build with as little space as possible outside the walls, and as much as possible inside
(10:17:10)<the_ru>to hold troops and supplies
(10:17:20)<the_ru>joe6pack: there are pillars there actually
(10:17:31)<the_ru>(not orcs!) :-O
(10:17:44)<joe6pack>no i mean outside 
(10:17:54)<the_ru>outside what?
(10:17:54)<joe6pack>to warn all those who venture forht
(10:18:11)<joe6pack>outside of the gate, at the same line the @ is at
(10:18:27)<the_ru>that's inside
(10:18:31)<the_ru>I*
(10:18:35)<the_ru>I'm entering from the south
(10:18:38)<joe6pack>oh
(10:18:49)<joe6pack>i thought it was the opposite... 
(10:19:03)<the_ru>you will notice in-game, I think
(10:19:08)<joe6pack>sure
(10:19:10)<the_ru>since you first appear on the bottom edge
(10:19:12)<joe6pack>if i am walking...
(10:19:37)<joe6pack>in that case
(10:19:55)<TMC>hehe, that gets the whole fortress back to front :P
(10:20:00)<joe6pack>my 1st suggestion would be to make the fort symmetric, but that's jus a matter of taste 
(10:21:48)<the_ru>I'm not sure it should use the "crowded city" generator
(10:22:11)<the_ru>perhaps just straight rows of houses, embedded in the mountainside would make more sense
(10:23:18)<joe6pack>take a look at maps of ancient forts

(10:46:00)<TMC>I still want something else behind it  :(
(10:58:52)<the_ru>yes, yes
(10:58:58)<the_ru>but I haven't decided what yet
(11:10:01)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.11-gemar3.png
(11:10:45)<joe6pack>looks better
(11:11:00)<the_ru>it should be more interesting once it has NPCs too
(11:15:40)<RotateMe>looks nice the_ru
(11:28:21)<RotateMe>is there sth like "using class XY;" in c++
(11:29:00)<RotateMe>so that i don't have to write "MyClass::myVab" in order to access static attributes and methods of classes i use frequently?
(11:29:32)<RotateMe>i want to replace my #define's with a class that holds static constants so this would come in handy
(11:43:48)<RotateMe>Skill Skills::skills[NUMBER_OF_SKILLS];
(11:43:55)<RotateMe>isn't it? ^^
(11:44:18)<TMC>I wish
(11:45:22)<TMC>but, couldn't must static methods and member be put in a namespace anyway?
(11:45:52)<TMC>I don't remember what the argument for static members was at all
(11:46:15)<TMC>*most static methods
(11:47:38)<TMC>...anyone is welcome to tell me
(11:58:35)<RotateMe>why do they have to be in  a namespace?
(11:58:42)<RotateMe>worked without so far
(11:58:52)<RotateMe>it's just very nasty
(11:59:41)<RotateMe>now i have the annyoing error "expected unqualified id before "using""
(12:02:58)<RotateMe>ugh got that
(12:11:52)<TMC>a namespace instead of a class
(12:27:47)<RotateMe>i should really read a book about c++ i guess i'm doing it all the wrong way
(12:28:03)<RotateMe>but as long as it works as well as it does right now i'm not motivated to do that
(12:38:50)<TMC>I'm no expert
(01:12:58)<the_ru>so, symphony of the night finished
(01:13:01)<the_ru>"finished"
(01:13:13)<the_ru>I didn't bother to get 200% map coverage, but I beat the final boss at least
(01:15:17)<the_ru>hm
(01:15:28)<the_ru>seems like there is a 4th ending that requires 200%
(01:15:34)<the_ru>but I don't care
(03:37:12)<the_ru>ah
(03:37:21)<the_ru>made an extension cord for our consoles
(03:37:34)<the_ru>so they can be on the shelf by the couch
(03:38:13)<the_ru>it tickled me slightly when I plugged it in, but I think it was just static from the TV
(03:57:00)<RotateMe>wow... c(++) is able to produce the STRANGEST errors
(03:57:18)<RotateMe>i used a constant in a wrong way and did some string operations
(03:57:41)<RotateMe>the text was a garbled mess transforming from time to time changing it's meaning
(03:57:56)<RotateMe>i think the computer was trying to tell me to take a break
(03:58:29)<the_ru>sounds like you're using uninitialized memory
(03:58:57)<RotateMe>i declared a const char * in a loop
(03:59:15)<RotateMe>i think this is not cool but it might have been something else, at least it works now
(03:59:42)<the_ru>a const char * doesn't make much sense
(03:59:47)<the_ru>what were you using it for?
(03:59:49)<RotateMe>strings is the only thing java is 100% better in as c++
(04:00:08)<RotateMe>a const char * is often required in the doryen library
(04:00:14)<RotateMe>eg. for printing in text boxes
(04:00:26)<the_ru>yes, but why declare one yourself?
(04:00:30)<RotateMe>but if you use string.c_str() you get what you want
(04:00:42)<the_ru>if you have a char * and pass it to a function wanting a const char * it will cast it automatically
(04:00:59)<the_ru>and shouldn't C++ code use references?
(04:01:22)<RotateMe>you mean not use them in c++? impossible!
(04:02:02)<RotateMe>or what do you mean?
(04:02:42)<the_ru>AFAIK, references are basically static pointers
(04:03:20)<the_ru>but anyway, why are you declaring const char *?
(04:03:32)<RotateMe>i don't anymore
(04:03:36)<the_ru>I can't see any reason to do that in a loop
(04:03:47)<RotateMe>it was just for readability
(04:04:01)<RotateMe>but you're right the "const" was not neccassery
(04:04:46)<the_ru>ok
(04:05:05)<RotateMe>i had a string i edit it, then i wanted it to pass to printleft which requires a const char *
(04:05:09)<the_ru>I try to use const as much as possible for function parameters
(04:05:38)<RotateMe>i wanted to do this in two steps, using a char * tmpLine which i filled with my string.c_str()
(04:05:50)<RotateMe>that didn't work because c_str() returns a const char *
(04:06:01)<RotateMe>so i redefined it, and the mess was perfect
(04:06:26)<the_ru>consts are IMO only really useful as function parameters
(04:06:35)<RotateMe>now i just use printLeft(myString.c_str());
(04:06:55)<the_ru>they guarantee that the data won't be modified
(04:07:10)<the_ru>(well, you can do an explicit const -> non-const cast, but that's really bad practice)
(04:07:13)<RotateMe>i don't think they're useful at all but you might now see how the compiler brought me into using it
(04:07:48)<RotateMe>i don't understand why c_str returns a const char
(04:07:49)<the_ru>they're useful when you have functions that only check things without changing them
(04:08:15)<RotateMe>well then i use pass by value
(04:08:15)<the_ru>if you declare a parameter const, the compiler will catch unintentional modifications
(04:08:26)<the_ru>such as a = being mistaken for ==
(04:08:46)<RotateMe>hmm right, that might come in handy
(04:09:05)<RotateMe>but like i said, the whole string stuff in c(++) is shit imo
(04:09:58)<the_ru>it also works downstream - if you have a const parameter, you can't pass it to another non-const function without the compiler complaining
(04:10:11)<the_ru>it really helps control where data goes and where it's modified
(04:10:23)<the_ru>why use C++ strings?
(04:10:30)<the_ru>C strings do all I need them to
(04:10:58)<RotateMe>what are c strings?
(04:11:01)<RotateMe>char * ?
(04:11:03)<the_ru>yes
(04:11:07)<the_ru>terminated by \0
(04:11:15)<the_ru>C++ strings are pretty much just a wrapper for it
(04:11:40)<the_ru>that translates stuff like s->getLen() to strlen(s->string);
(04:11:45)<the_ru>where string is a char *
(04:11:49)<RotateMe>well i need the string operation functions and i don't want to do them on my own
(04:11:55)<the_ru>that's probably why c_str returns a const char *
(04:12:03)<the_ru>what functions?
(04:12:15)<the_ru>str* and sprintf can do most things
(04:12:17)<RotateMe>find, substr and some others
(04:12:31)<RotateMe>oh rly?
(04:12:53)<RotateMe>well i guess there's no other way but reading a book
(04:13:01)<RotateMe>first a c book then a c++ book :(
(04:13:04)<the_ru>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String.h
(04:13:14)<the_ru>I had the same problem
(04:13:18)<the_ru>tried to learn C++ before C
(04:13:33)<the_ru>but much of the stuff in C++ doesn't make sense until you learn *why* it's there
(04:13:46)<the_ru>and you don't have to do everything "the C++ way" just because you can
(04:14:18)<the_ru>I'd say write C code, then borrow a bit of C++ when you need that extra flexibility
(04:14:58)<the_ru>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library
(04:15:36)<RotateMe>thanks, i'll have a look
(04:15:45)<RotateMe>i already printed a pretty good c book
(04:15:56)<the_ru>I once spent a day writing my own strtok()
(04:16:05)<the_ru>then I found out there already was one :-(
(04:16:22)<the_ru>so getting familiar with the standard library really helps, regardless if you're using C or C++
(04:16:47)<the_ru>now I must do the dishes
(04:16:48)<the_ru>BBIAB
(04:28:06)<Kadwiell>strtok in particular is a rather weird function though, I've reimplemented that before just because I found the original inelegant
(04:33:16)<the_ru>the biggest problem is that it trashes the original string
(04:33:59)<the_ru>but my point was; for basic things, there's usually a function already that does it good enough
(04:34:34)<Aerton>strtok() is quite a hackish thing
(04:34:57)<Aerton>never understood how did it find it's way into standard
(04:35:35)<the_ru>still, if you just need it one time, it's faster to learn to work around its shortcoming than to develop your own
(04:36:23)<Aerton>it's not that flexible
(04:36:53)<the_ru>flexible enough to parse files
(04:38:08)<Aerton>some other standard functions are too strange at time... like WTF strncpy() does not close string with 0?
(04:38:35)<the_ru>what if I want to copy something into a "form"?
(04:39:41)<Kadwiell>There's also gets(), which I believe is absolutely impossible to use safely
(04:39:58)<Kadwiell>Seems they weren't very picky about what got into the standard..
(04:40:30)<the_ru>BUGS
(04:40:30)<the_ru>       Never use gets().  Because it is impossible to tell without knowing the
(04:40:30)<the_ru>       data in advance how many  characters  gets()  will  read,  and  because
(04:40:30)<the_ru>       gets() will continue to store characters past the end of the buffer, it
(04:40:30)<the_ru>       is extremely dangerous to use.  It has  been  used  to  break  computer
(04:40:32)<the_ru>       security.  Use fgets() instead.
(04:40:40)<Aerton>well, it can be needed sometimes, but the most common usage case would be to just copy a string, and there is simply no convenient routine for that
(04:41:02)<Aerton>(snprintf does not count)
(04:41:10)<the_ru>strdup?
(04:41:32)<Aerton>spare me...
(04:41:50)<Aerton>it's not even close
(04:42:02)<the_ru>I dunno what you want to do
(04:42:17)<Aerton>safely copy one string to another
(04:43:43)<the_ru>so what's wrong with strncpy?
(04:43:47)<the_ru>you *know* where it ends
(04:44:03)<Aerton>you have to write 0 yourself
(04:44:30)<the_ru>so create a mystrncpy() that does it for you
(04:45:51)<Aerton>one could expect to find such a simple and commonly needed thing among standard functions
(04:46:18)<Aerton>I bet, it's needed much more often than obscurities like aforementioned strtok()
(04:46:20)<the_ru>yeah, I get your point
(04:46:49)<the_ru>but why this came up is because many C++ books fail to mention the standard library
(04:47:14)<the_ru>they quickly jump into classes, pointers, inheritance - but rarely say how to actually get anything *done*
(04:47:49)<Aerton>these aren't good books
(04:48:18)<Aerton>or simply old books written before STL was included into the language standard
(04:48:55)<Kadwiell>I think perhaps he means that they do describe STL but not the "old" C features?
(04:49:02)<the_ru>yes
(04:49:15)<Kadwiell>Which is a problem mostly because some of the C++ things meant to replace them aren't very good
(04:49:16)<the_ru>and it's hard to tell as a newbie what books are good :-)
(04:49:41)<Kadwiell>Notably the string class, in my opinion, and also streams
(04:49:48)<the_ru>well, as you probably know I'm using C myself
(04:49:55)<the_ru>I don't really see the need to go C++
(04:50:30)<the_ru>Java has much of the same problem as well
(04:50:34)<the_ru>Like file I/O
(04:51:01)<the_ru>it's powerful once you know how it works, but it's hard to get something done in the beginning
(04:51:23)<Glowie>STL isn't a good reason to go to C++?
(04:51:38)<Aerton>well, much of the C routines are considered obsolete and their usage is discouraged in c++
(04:52:09)<Aerton>although, C++ "streams" are one big WTF
(04:52:38)<Kadwiell>Yeah, but sprintf is so much easier than the ostringstream stuff, for example
(04:53:43)<Kadwiell>So it doesn't matter too much that sprintf is "considered obsolete", if it's superior in practice
(04:54:36)<the_ru>I think most of the things that differ between C and C++ require some experience
(04:54:47)<the_ru>to understand when, and especially when not, to use them
(04:57:08)<the_ru>operator overloading, is it necessary?
(04:57:16)<the_ru>Java doesn't have them and I never missed them
(04:57:43)<Aerton>it's double-edged
(04:58:15)<Aerton>it's convenient when you can write vector or matrix math with + and *
(04:58:50)<Aerton>but it can be abused easily and too often
(04:59:03)<the_ru>but wouldn't a matrixAdd() do the same thing?
(04:59:24)<the_ru>or rather; be the same thing, but with a different name
(04:59:47)<Aerton>it would, but not so clearly and it would look different from notation in a math book
(04:59:55)<the_ru>but then even Java cheats a bit by allowing + for string concatenation
(05:01:03)<Kadwiell>True, I'd have liked the Java approach more if it actually was consistent
(05:02:17)<the_ru>Aerton: does it really matter? very little looks the same as in a math book
(05:02:27)<the_ru>i.e. everything beyond +-*/()
(05:02:37)<the_ru>%
(05:02:57)<Aerton>it is nice, but not to the point of make-or-break
(05:02:58)<the_ru>and then we have the assignment vs. comparision argument
(05:14:55)<the_ru>Aerton: actually, I use strncpy to build my overworld map :-O
(05:18:18)<Aerton>=)
(05:19:21)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.11-overworld.png
(05:19:32)<the_ru>it feels like I'm mostly producing screenshots these days
(05:19:39)<the_ru>what do you think of the mountains?
(05:19:56)<the_ru>I think it's a bit hard to tell the different terrain apart
(05:20:52)<Aerton>hm, probably painting them brown could help
(05:21:03)<the_ru>they used to be brown
(05:21:07)<the_ru>I think it's better this way
(05:22:00)<the_ru>perhaps it would be better if I had LOs
(05:22:16)<the_ru>then there would be a smaller part of the world to focus on at any time

(10:27:48)<the_ru>morning
(10:27:54)<the_ru>we have snow!
(10:28:42)<TMC>morning
(10:28:52)<TMC>this computer seems to be restarting randomly
(10:29:05)<TMC>I know that the CPU overheats and clocks down
(10:29:24)<TMC>but it doesn't seem to be running hotter than normal, onyl up to 75 degrees
(10:40:03)<TMC>80
(10:40:25)<the_ru>bad fan?
(10:40:56)<TMC>probably
(10:41:20)<TMC>80 degree under stress that is
(10:45:13)<TMC>but 55 when idle seems unreasonable to me
(10:45:25)<the_ru>have you checked it?
(10:45:33)<the_ru>they seem to become clogged up with dust once in a while
(10:47:22)<TMC>well not recently
(10:47:30)<TMC>but it wasn't any better after I last did
(10:47:52)<the_ru>perhaps you need a better fan
(10:48:23)<the_ru>does it adjust its RPM after the current load?
(10:48:30)<the_ru>perhaps it should be on max all the time
(10:50:36)<TMC>it does
(10:51:03)<TMC>but you're right, it doesn't seem to go to max even when overheating
(10:55:13)<the_ru>huh
(10:55:15)<the_ru>WTF
(10:55:17)<the_ru>4 - (-1) * get_attr_current(creature, attr_vitality)
(10:56:53)<joe6pack>snow?
(10:56:59)<the_ru>yes
(10:57:04)<joe6pack>i guess i'm lucky
(10:57:07)<joe6pack>17c :)
(10:57:15)<joe6pack>and sunny 
(10:57:17)<the_ru>it'll be gone tonight I suppose
(11:01:25)<joe6pack>i guess i'm luckyc when idle about normal? my laptop is 50 right now (also mostly idle)
(11:01:32)<joe6pack>ugh
(11:01:39)<joe6pack>pressed the up arrow
(11:02:02)<joe6pack>s/i guess i'm lucky/isn't 50
(11:02:20)<joe6pack>*55
(11:03:41)<TMC>maaaybe
(11:03:44)<TMC>it is a prescott
(11:04:11)<joe6pack>mine is an amd sempron 
(11:04:31)<joe6pack>but actually it gets cooler than 50 in winter
(11:04:36)<joe6pack>but not much
(11:04:41)<joe6pack>maybe 47-48
(11:44:22)<the_ru>hm hm
(11:44:28)<the_ru>I wonder if I should release TSL 0.11
(11:44:44)<joe6pack>when was the last release? 
(11:47:44)<the_ru>080427
(11:47:57)<joe6pack>a short while ago
(11:48:06)<the_ru>yes
(11:48:13)<joe6pack>did you add anything significant/fix any important bugs?
(11:48:36)<the_ru>yes, but many things aren't really "complete" yet
(11:48:52)<the_ru>hunger, for example - the system is in place but there are very few food items
(11:49:00)<the_ru>only corpses for now
(11:49:00)<joe6pack>if you think you'll complete them soon i'd wait a bit before the release 
(11:49:13)<joe6pack>well that's easy to add :)
(11:49:27)<the_ru>yeah, but it takes time
(11:49:43)<the_ru>$ wc -l TODO
(11:49:43)<the_ru>142 TODO
(11:49:44)<the_ru>:-)
(11:50:20)<joe6pack>the system that worked well for me is to encourage people to get it directly from subversion
(11:50:37)<the_ru>and then my cities; they are generated fine, but empty
(11:50:48)<the_ru>but adding real NPCs will take time
(11:51:12)<the_ru>that's basically what I'm doing here, except I do it manually
(11:51:20)<the_ru>I'm not sure I'll even announce it anywhere
(11:51:31)<joe6pack>ok
(11:51:34)<the_ru>but it feels good just to draw a line and say, yes, finally I'm getting somewhere
(11:51:42)<joe6pack>then go for it :)
(11:52:12)<joe6pack>if you consider each change i commited as a release then i've sometimes had several releases in one day...
(11:52:21)<joe6pack>i just didn't number them
(11:55:20)<the_ru>I think I'll have to slow down a bit with 0.12, go back and change some things
(11:56:01)<the_ru>poison: it works, but there are very few ways to get poisoned
(11:56:14)<the_ru>poison resistance: it works, but there's only one way to get it ATM
(12:08:36)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/files/tsl-0.11.tar.gz
(12:27:54)<the_ru>Anyone played Lords of Magic?
(12:28:06)<the_ru>They pretty much ripped off HOMM
(12:28:18)<the_ru>and it has lots of bugs
(12:28:20)<the_ru>but I still like it
(12:28:26)<the_ru>I should play it sometime
(12:55:38)<joe6pack>never heard of it
(01:14:57)<TMC>ok maybe it isn't overheating, it's just random
(01:15:27)<TMC>that was XP, hasn't restarted under linux yet :D
(01:25:38)<the_ru>it wasn't as great as I remembered it
(01:26:15)<the_ru>I guess it's one of those games that would have kicked ass if they had only had a few months more to polish it
(01:38:00)<the_ru>I wonder what the hell is going on with our net connection
(01:38:13)<the_ru>pages don't load properly
(01:38:36)<the_ru>either it's our ISP or the switch is about to give up
(01:44:26)<jraregris>my options file on nao seems to have been reset. anyone else noticed anything similar?
(01:54:23)<joe6pack>nao?
(02:37:40)<jraregris>yeah, nethack.alt.org
(05:25:40)<the_ru>13598 packets transmitted, 13503 packets received, 0.7% packet loss
(05:27:37)<the_ru>I want @ to be reserved for the player only
(05:27:52)<the_ru>any suggestions?
(05:27:53)<the_ru>&?
(05:38:25)<jraregris>It depends, if you me.
(05:38:41)<jraregris>Are all the npc-s human?
(05:39:23)<jraregris>Are the npc-s always friendly?
(06:34:57)<Kadwiell>You could reserve only @ in a particular colour for the player, and keep @ in general as shorthand for things that are approximately human
(06:41:13)<jraregris>yeah, I'd give npcs the same symbol as everything else of the same race, or whatever way you divide stuff up
(07:10:40)<the_ru>I don't have any humans
(07:13:09)<the_ru>and I'm still trying to keep it playable in monochrome, so I don't want to use colors to differentiate between the player and others :-)
(07:26:39)<jraregris>what game are you making?
(07:33:23)<deveah>moi?
(07:34:29)<deveah>nothing atm
(07:35:49)<deveah>i'm thinking of rewriting my engine
(07:36:38)<deveah>CarpatiLib or smth
(07:51:24)<jraregris>hehe... 
(07:51:40)<jraregris>i was thinking of the_ru. :)
(08:23:22)<Kadwiell>There are no humans in your game? What sort of setting are you using?
(08:25:23)<jraregris>If NPCs doesn't share race with anyone, like NPC _is_ their race, I'd go for '&'
(09:06:28)<the_ru>Kadwiell: you can imagine them to be human
(09:06:32)<the_ru>they're undefined
(09:06:54)<the_ru>player gender is undefined as well
(09:07:28)<jraregris>are the enemies undefined as well?
(09:07:48)<the_ru>no, they're quite specific
(09:08:00)<the_ru>goblins, giant toads, wraiths
(09:08:01)<the_ru>etc etc
(09:08:24)<jraregris>but the NPCs are just NPCs?
(09:08:38)<the_ru>They're the same as you
(09:08:42)<the_ru>whatever you imagine yourself to be
(09:08:48)<the_ru>human, elf, lizardman
(09:08:50)<the_ru>I dunno
(09:12:27)<jraregris>aha
(09:12:43)<jraregris>then I'd go for a @
(09:13:48)<jraregris>I know you said you were aiming for monochrome support, but the player-@ is usually marked by the 'cursor', so you'll be able to tell them apart
(09:14:11)<jraregris>like when you're invisible in nethack you appear as a 
(09:14:12)<jraregris>.
(09:14:24)<the_ru>I don't have cursor visible most of the time :-/
(09:14:30)<the_ru>I think they're somewhat annoying
(09:14:48)<jraregris>aha
(09:15:04)<the_ru>I think I'll use @ for the player, then & for NPCs
(09:15:11)<the_ru>monsters get their own letters
(09:15:20)<jraregris>sounds good
(09:15:35)<the_ru>but then there are the borderline cases
(09:15:39)<the_ru>liches, for example
(09:28:20)<the_ru>hm
(09:28:29)<the_ru>what would be a good way to handle containers?
(09:28:42)<the_ru>I'm not really comfortable with Nethacks #loot
(09:29:02)<the_ru>I don't really need to be able to put things back into containers
(09:29:07)<the_ru>nor pick them up
(09:29:23)<the_ru>they just sit on the floor until they are opened, lockpicked or broken
(09:32:30)<jraregris>how about just 'pick up' on it when it's open?
(09:32:52)<jraregris>treat it as a floor tile that has to be opened to get the stuff inside
(09:33:08)<the_ru>Hm
(09:33:17)<the_ru>I think they should be blocking
(09:33:25)<the_ru>I also have coffins, that contain undeads
(09:33:54)<the_ru>perhaps I shouldn't have any containers at all
(09:34:09)<the_ru>I don't really have any type that can hold them anyway
(09:34:32)<the_ru>they lack several properties that monsters have, so they require a lot of special cases
(09:34:48)<the_ru>and they have some properties items don't have, so they require a lot of special cases
(09:35:06)<the_ru>and having a separate class of items inbetween requires a lot of special cases
(09:36:29)<the_ru>perhaps I should just have a coffin/grave tile, and a special trap type near each one
(09:36:41)<the_ru>that when stepped on spawns a ghoul by the coffin
(09:43:18)<jraregris>what language are you programming in?
(09:44:43)<the_ru>C
(09:48:15)<the_ru>braziers is another thing I'd like to have
(09:48:59)<the_ru>should I just have permalit areas supposedly lit by lanterns in the ceiling
(09:49:02)<the_ru>or torches on the walls
(09:49:43)<jraregris>you could have both
(09:49:44)<jraregris>:)
(09:50:42)<the_ru>yes
(09:50:58)<the_ru>but it would be cool if the braziers were actual objects on the world
(09:51:07)<the_ru>then you could throw a potion on them to put them out?
(09:51:09)<the_ru>:-O
(09:51:28)<the_ru>... or wind magic ...
(09:51:31)<the_ru>... or ...
(09:53:24)<jraregris>yeah
(09:53:35)<jraregris>and you could throw them
(09:54:06)<the_ru>wouldn't they be too heavy?
(09:54:27)<jraregris>yeah, I just looked up what braziers are actually are. :P
(09:54:37)<jraregris>you could pick up torches, though
(09:54:56)<the_ru>I could have the braziers as items
(09:55:14)<the_ru>then they could be picked up, and provide extra illumination when they are
(09:55:29)<the_ru>but then; what if the player is standing on top of one?
(09:55:32)<the_ru>that ought to get "hot"
(09:55:37)<jraregris>yeah
(09:56:09)<jraregris>he could get damage but temporarily increase his willpower
(09:56:14)<the_ru>and also, it should then be possible to light and put out *any* light source, and put them on the floor
(09:56:28)<jraregris>sounds fun
(09:56:40)<the_ru>I don't see any use for it though
(09:56:46)<the_ru>I mean, it would be realistic
(09:56:50)<jraregris>I do
(09:57:05)<jraregris>I find the sandbox aspect of roguelikes super fun
(09:57:17)<the_ru>like in a mine; lighting a lantern, then putting it down, then grabbing the pickaxe with *both* hands
(09:57:49)<jraregris>you could use it to disctract enemies, for escape
(09:57:50)<the_ru>but is it the kind of thing you do once, think "oh, cool", then forget about?
(09:58:24)<the_ru>my game actually places greater emphasis on darkness than light
(09:58:29)<the_ru>stealth, and all that
(09:58:32)<jraregris>it's the thing i think about when I'm down to only a couple of hitpoints and no magic and a desperate situation.
(09:58:40)<jraregris>cool, then it will be extra useful
(09:59:06)<the_ru>lanterns could explode when thrown
(09:59:12)<jraregris>yeah
(09:59:30)<jraregris>you could set up chain reactions with unlit braziers and throwing lanterns
(09:59:40)<jraregris>make fire traps
(09:59:52)<jraregris>i already want to play your game
(09:59:55)<the_ru>it's not really a problem to implement... I just wonder if it's worth having a specific "light" action for
(10:00:17)<the_ru>currently, my light sources are assumed to be lit when equipped and put out when removed
(10:00:27)<jraregris>you mean if they should actually emit light?
(10:00:47)<the_ru>no, if the player should have to specifically ignite them
(10:00:58)<jraregris>ah... 
(10:01:15)<jraregris>I'd like to have the choice if I want a lamp to be lit or not
(10:01:17)<the_ru>and for realism; shouldn't that require flint and steel, or something
(10:01:25)<the_ru>well, you already have
(10:01:33)<the_ru>if it's equipped, it's lit
(10:02:33)<the_ru>it feels a bit too complicated to 1) pick up torch, 2) hold torch, 3) light torch
(10:02:45)<the_ru>and maybe 4) throw lit torch
(10:04:10)<the_ru>and what about flammable liquids
(10:04:20)<the_ru>you could first throw a potion of oil
(10:04:23)<the_ru>then throw a lit torch
(10:04:25)<the_ru>on an enemy
(10:04:54)<the_ru>or you could drink a potion of oil, then "eat" a torch, and you'd breathe fire
(10:04:56)<joe6pack>this reminds me of the new alone in the dark demo
(10:05:22)<joe6pack>you just need to add some sticky tape
(10:05:54)<joe6pack>http://www.gametrailers.com/player/usermovies/177013.html
(10:07:06)<the_ru>Hm, doesn't play
(10:07:13)<the_ru>but I read it had sophisticated fire
(10:07:17)<joe6pack>works for me 
(10:07:33)<jraregris>I actually thought of making an AitDRL
(10:08:01)<the_ru>I suppose I lack the proper plugin
(10:08:05)<the_ru>I try to keep them to a minimum
(10:08:15)<joe6pack>for some reason i remembered the original being a quest 
(10:08:17)<the_ru>but my connection is too slow to stream video anyway :-/
(10:10:10)<the_ru>but what about something more basic: bonfires
(10:10:10)<jraregris>I like the way games are more like this. more interesting use of objects and physics and such
(10:10:22)<joe6pack>yes
(10:10:23)<the_ru>it can't be an item
(10:10:33)<the_ru>could it be a terrain type?
(10:11:06)<jraregris>but I'd think it would be cool to see a game where the 'creative use and combination of objects' is a "bonus" more than the main gameplay
(10:11:07)<joe6pack>the_ru: i guess the item is the wood?
(10:11:16)<joe6pack>and it just happen to be lit up
(10:12:16)<joe6pack>jraregris: isn't nethack that way?
(10:12:18)<the_ru>would it make sense to pick it up?
(10:12:44)<joe6pack>i would reckon it causes damage per turn if you try to pick up a burning log
(10:14:09)<the_ru>wouldn't it be more like a torch?
(10:14:12)<joe6pack>i've actually never played nethack to any meaningful extent of time, but i remember reading that you can do lots of combinations of items
(10:14:32)<the_ru>you can
(10:14:38)<the_ru>but it
(10:14:40)<joe6pack>maybe if only a part of it is burning... 
(10:14:44)<the_ru>but it's not really intuitive
(10:14:54)<the_ru>it's more like "read a cursed scroll of X to get effect Y instead"
(10:15:13)<the_ru>but in the case of a large bonfire?
(10:15:24)<joe6pack>from what i remeber from setting up bonfires as kid you can't normally just yank a plank out of the pile without getting burned 
(10:15:56)<the_ru>I already have a lava terrain type - it illuminates the nearby tiles and burns creatures that walk into it
(10:16:08)<the_ru>I suppose a bonfire could be the same, with another name
(10:16:21)<the_ru>but what about burn time?
(10:16:26)<the_ru>it should go out sometime
(10:16:40)<the_ru>and what about flammable walls
(10:16:54)<the_ru>it would be cool if you could cast a fire spell in a city, and the houses would catch fire
(10:17:10)<the_ru>only a pile of soot and rubble would remain
(10:17:12)<joe6pack>i think that's a bit too complicated 
(10:17:31)<the_ru>probably
(10:17:42)<the_ru>but we're talking complicated item interactions, right? :-)
(10:18:00)<joe6pack>:)
(10:18:05)<the_ru>and what about cooking
(10:18:31)<the_ru>if you apply a piece of meat to a weapon, then swing it over a fire or lava square, it would be cooked
(10:20:01)<the_ru>BarbecueRL
(10:23:56)<jraregris>YouHaveToBurnTheRopeRL
(10:25:57)<the_ru>hm
(10:26:16)<the_ru>what if equipping a torch lights it, and removing it puts it out
(10:26:27)<the_ru>when it's equipped, you can (a)pply it to light or put it out
(10:26:53)<jraregris>makes sens
(10:26:57)<jraregris>sense
(10:26:58)<the_ru>it just doesn't make sense to light the torch when it's still in your pack
(10:27:20)<jraregris>though it would make even more sense if it defaulted to unlit
(10:28:02)<the_ru>but OTOH, why would you equip a torch if you don't light it?
(10:28:17)<jraregris>you could hit with it
(10:28:46)<the_ru>yeah, but that's a separate mechanic
(10:28:49)<the_ru>or it will be, I hope
(10:28:59)<the_ru>I currently only support wielding actual weapons
(10:29:22)<the_ru>I plan to allow any item... but it requires changing the equipment system
(10:30:03)<jraregris>ok, but unless I'm misunderstanding, there's no way to equip a torch without litting it (and so possibly revealing your location) 
(10:30:15)<the_ru>right
(10:30:23)<the_ru>but why would you want to do that?
(10:30:33)<jraregris>yeah, I could
(10:30:38)<the_ru>equipping it basically means you light it
(10:30:44)<the_ru>wielding will be different
(10:30:54)<the_ru>and why would you wield a torch if it's not lit?
(10:31:27)<jraregris>in Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indy sets of traps with his torch
(10:31:58)<the_ru>I haven't seen those yet :-/
(10:32:07)<jraregris>You should!
(10:32:13)<the_ru>I'm going to!
(10:32:18)<the_ru>I've even downloaded them
(10:32:22)<jraregris>They're top adventure movies!
(10:32:24)<jraregris>:D
(10:32:47)<the_ru>they showed them on TV here last weekend
(10:32:55)<the_ru>but I didn't have time then
(10:32:57)<jraregris>You'll get more of the Archeologist class in Nethack when you've seen them
(10:33:14)<the_ru>yes, I know the image
(10:34:17)<the_ru>but what would be the use of throwing a torch?
(10:34:33)<the_ru>if it's lit, and torches illuminate even when lying on the floor
(10:34:39)<the_ru>I could throw one into a room to see what's there
(10:34:40)<the_ru>I guess
(10:35:05)<the_ru>but is it practical enough to motivate adding the functionality?
(10:35:07)<jraregris>yeah, there's almost an unlimited uses when you've got interesting items like that
(10:35:35)<jraregris>to me it would, but it's your game :)
(10:38:25)<the_ru>what if I'd replace torches with a more generic firewood item?
(10:38:51)<the_ru>if you'd assemble enough of them on the same tile, it'd turn into a permanent bonfire
(10:39:07)<jraregris>fun
(10:39:48)<the_ru>then you could collect the ash for use as magical reagent...
(10:39:49)<the_ru>:-)
(10:40:11)<jraregris>you could eat it to cure 'silence'
(10:40:24)<the_ru>eat ash?
(10:40:33)<jraregris>here in norway, at least, eating ash is good for your voice
(10:40:39)<jraregris>hehe
(10:40:43)<the_ru>if you were polymorphed into a beaver, you could eat wood
(10:40:47)<the_ru>8-D
(10:41:00)<the_ru>never heard of that
(10:41:15)<jraregris>came out a little weird, I mean that it's said in norway, not that works better here than other places
(10:41:48)<the_ru>yeah, I understood
(10:41:54)<the_ru>but I've never heard of that practice actually
(10:42:13)<jraregris>it might have been coal, not ash
(10:42:14)<the_ru>I've heard about coal curing stomach illnesses
(10:42:32)<jraregris>but it's close enough to be justified in a rl
(10:42:46)<jraregris>could also work
(10:43:24)<the_ru>heh, yes
(10:43:30)<the_ru>if carrots can cure blindness, why not
(10:43:54)<jraregris>yeah. there's a lot of stuff that's only real in roguelikes. :)
(10:45:35)<joe6pack>the carrots and eyesight thing is something i've also heard about
(10:45:43)<jraregris>i want a 'lick' command in mine *noting down*
(10:46:13)<joe6pack>and eating chalk for curing ulcer
(10:48:42)<joe6pack>no uni tomorrow 
(10:48:51)<joe6pack>a long weekend :)
(10:49:02)<joe6pack>damn
(10:49:07)<joe6pack>have to prepare a seminar 
(10:49:56)<jraregris>studying something fun?
(10:57:36)<joe6pack>no
(10:58:20)<joe6pack>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krylov_subspace
(10:59:36)<joe6pack>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMRES
(11:00:03)<joe6pack>i have to give a talk about GMRES
(11:00:11)<joe6pack>on friday 
(11:00:21)<the_ru>joe6pack: nethack has it IIRC
(11:00:36)<joe6pack>nethack has GMRES?
(11:00:39)<the_ru>but I've also read that carrots improving vision is largely a myth
(11:00:44)<the_ru>no, carrots
(11:00:55)<joe6pack>of course, these are all myths 
(11:01:18)<joe6pack>old wives' tales
(11:02:33)<jraregris>Carrots can only improve your vision if you're suffering from malnutrition, and lack vitamin a
(11:03:00)<jraregris>but there's other vegetables more rich in vitamin a that work better
(11:03:00)<joe6pack>good night
(11:03:04)<jraregris>night
+++ The date has changed: 2008/05/12 +++
(03:19:24)<Fobbah>hey all
(03:34:17)<jraregris>hey Fobbah
(03:44:50)<Fobbah>what's up?
(04:09:55)<jraregris>I'm staying up late instead of sleeping
(04:10:31)<Fobbah>heh its midday here and i'm up from the night before :)
(04:10:56)<Fobbah>alternating between getting my university work done and tinkering with my new RL
(04:20:02)<jraregris>The postapocalyptical one, yes?
(04:20:17)<jraregris>augh... i need coffee brb
(04:22:21)<Fobbah>yeah, i came across it the other day and just started working on it again
(04:22:28)<jraregris>cool
(04:22:47)<Fobbah>i'd written most of it years ago, did all the hard yards, then got bored of it right when i got up to the fun part of adding all the content lol
(04:23:23)<jraregris>I, regretably, don't have time to check it out right now, but I've noted it down in my to-do-list
(04:23:37)<jraregris>i noticed that you've written it in java
(04:24:09)<Fobbah>its got its advantages
(04:24:41)<jraregris>i use java as well
(04:24:50)<Fobbah>java's excellent serializable interface makes saving/loading cake, and ive gone with a very oop heavy structure, worked out well
(04:25:38)<jraregris>inheritance and such can be very useful for monsters/items etc. in roguelikes
(04:26:17)<Fobbah>yeah, all of my items/mobiles/skills/ais/whatevers are built upon abstract classes
(04:27:27)<jraregris>do you have a general 'object' class that serves as a superclass for both items and mobiles?
(04:27:45)<jraregris>i guess you mean monsters/people/etc by mobiles
(04:28:48)<Fobbah>nah
(04:29:12)<Fobbah>it might be convenient for certain effects that can target both items and mobiles.. havnt really thought about it
(04:29:44)<Fobbah>or does java.lang.Object count? ;)
(04:30:19)<jraregris>I've only just started, and I'm pretty fresh as programmer as well, and I thought it might be useful to generalize 'objects in the world'
(04:31:16)<jraregris>so everything could potentially be destroyed (have toughness, etc) and moved, be lifted, thrown, etc.
(04:32:00)<Fobbah>it wouldnt be difficult to chnage that
(04:32:44)<Fobbah>all i have to do is make the item and mobile objects superclasses extensions of the main object class
(04:34:58)<Fobbah>its a good idea though
(04:35:32)<Fobbah>save you headaches later if you want to add such features
(04:38:35)<jraregris>do you use any premade libraries?
(04:38:38)<Fobbah>heres an excellent link to a way of structuring the AI
(04:38:38)<Fobbah>http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Plug-In_Monster_AI
(04:38:56)<Fobbah>nah, i had a few small libraries written myself already though
(04:39:22)<Fobbah>stuff from tile based games i'd made and an A* algorithm i'd developed for a much simpler roguelike ages ago which nevery really worked out
(04:40:02)<jraregris>cool
(04:41:21)<jraregris>do you often hang around here (#rgrd)? (I seldom remember people unless i can connect them with something)
(04:41:31)<Fobbah>not often
(04:42:01)<Fobbah>will probably hang around here for a while now that roguelikes are my captivation for the month lol
(04:42:08)<jraregris>it's understandable to dropping by when you've just released
(04:42:18)<jraregris>hehe
(04:42:54)<jraregris>the channel has a very high "signal versus noise" ratio, IMP
(04:43:00)<jraregris>:P IMO
(04:44:30)<Fobbah>what you mean by that?
(04:44:40)<Fobbah>as in more announcements rather than casual chat?
(04:45:25)<jraregris>compared to other "themed" channels, this channel usually sticks more to the topic (rl dev) and also the conversations are interesting
(04:45:44)<Fobbah>ah
(04:46:04)<jraregris>on the other hand, it's not a place where newbies usually drop by
(04:46:32)<Fobbah>i was just curious to see if there was actually any RL devs hanging out anywhere
(04:47:22)<Fobbah>the RL dev community is kinda scattered for casual conversation, all we really have is usenet which can be painful, esp with all the spam lately
(04:47:47)<jraregris>'til I have something more than a empty (except from the player) room with a random starting point to show for myself, I guess I count as a wannabie RL dev
(04:48:42)<jraregris>usenet also seems to leave less room for actual conversation. it's more debating.
(04:49:02)<Fobbah>yeah
(04:49:21)<Fobbah>perhaps the community would be beter served by a moderated forum
(04:50:08)<jraregris>i think the usenet-irc-wiki (roguebasin) trinity works ok
(04:50:31)<jraregris>usenet is sort of 'ownerless' which i think is good
(04:51:03)<jraregris>I can do without forum poltics
(04:51:09)<Fobbah>the downside is you cant sticky announcements, remove spam, properly archive content, etc etc
(04:51:28)<jraregris>yeah, but that purpose is served by the wiki
(04:51:38)<jraregris>I assume you're familiar with it
(04:51:52)<Fobbah>yeah the basin is good
(04:51:56)<jraregris>yeah
(04:52:13)<Fobbah>its a shame a lot of the articles on roguelikedevelopment.org went down
(04:52:24)<jraregris>I were really impessed with it first time I actually looked for info there
(04:52:26)<Fobbah>some of those were really good
(04:52:47)<jraregris>it was moved pretty recently, wasn't it?
(04:53:01)<jraregris>from a 'site' to a wiki?
(04:53:08)<Fobbah>not all of it
(04:53:29)<Fobbah>the guy running the old site went to move the content to the wiki, but asked all the content owners permission first
(04:53:53)<jraregris>ah... that's the right way to do it
(04:53:59)<Fobbah>since half the articles were the better part of a decade old, most of those requests never got through, and now the original site with the articles is gone
(04:54:22)<Fobbah>i'm all for asking permission, but its a shame that now they're gone altogether
(04:55:06)<jraregris>yeah
(04:55:18)<jraregris>one might consider the articles abandonware
(04:55:29)<Fobbah>indeed
(04:56:51)<jraregris>you ought to enter Escape from Fobbahland to the wiki
(04:57:05)<Fobbah>i probably will in a few versions
(04:57:32)<Fobbah>i really want to improve the random dungeon generator and add more depth to the dungeon before i properly release it
(04:58:40)<Fobbah>the game takes a lot of similarities from DoomRL, but i'm planning on having more random content so each game is more unique
(04:59:59)<jraregris>thanks for the AI-link, btw. it's very similar to what I've had in mind, so it's cool to see the code
(05:00:39)<Fobbah>i think taking that mentality when developing my AI and all my objects is the most important factor thats made my code not turn into mush so far
(05:00:59)<Fobbah>and the way things are set up i now have quite a lot of power to add new features very quickly
(05:01:19)<Fobbah>be them new monsters or changes to the behavior of a huge number of items etc
(05:02:20)<jraregris>yeah, an object oriented approach makes lots of sense
(05:04:28)<jraregris>how are you doing the ui-thing?
(05:04:52)<Fobbah>you mean my console?
(05:05:07)<jraregris>yeah
(05:05:13)<jraregris>swing?
(05:05:48)<Fobbah>yeah ive got a pretty simple setup using a frame just with the terminal built into it
(05:06:29)<Fobbah>coded a simple terminal as you cant really do any proper output to the shell from java as you know
(05:07:24)<jraregris>yeah. not being able to produce true console output sort of 'cured' me from trying to make a 'true' roguelike.
(05:07:57)<Fobbah>its ok, as a whole the program is not as fast as it should be. Its still quite playable but i need to figure out ways to speed it all up, as its just not as fast as most other roguelikes and it would be nicer
(05:08:20)<Fobbah>i'm not sure where the bottleneck is, whether its in the terminal itself or some other part of the code but i'll figure that out soon
(05:08:23)<jraregris>in the sense that now I just want to make whatever I think'll be fun, and not care about what's usually considered required or not.
(05:08:34)<Fobbah>definitely
(05:08:45)<Fobbah>ive taken a note from DoomRl and added sound and midi music too :)
(05:08:51)<jraregris>cool
(05:09:06)<Fobbah>spent a while collecting video game midis and ive been putting them in as i go along
(05:10:15)<jraregris>in true RL spirit, I thought about auto generated music
(05:10:34)<Fobbah>lol good luck with that
(05:10:38)<jraregris>thanks :)
(05:11:20)<Fobbah>i gotta reccomend putting in sound in at the least though, it does make the game a lot more satisfying imho
(05:11:29)<jraregris>I'm also working on a java midi sequencer, and I guess I could use some from that
(05:11:32)<Fobbah>people underestimate how important sound and music are to the video game experience
(05:12:32)<jraregris>generated sound could be fun as well. but it would have to be pretty simple.
(05:12:47)<jraregris>c64-like effects could be generated.
(05:13:00)<Fobbah>indeed
(05:14:13)<jraregris>my problem is that i never get around to program, so my ideas far outrun my actual progress
(05:14:42)<Fobbah>for some reason i get the most programming done when i'm really busy
(05:14:58)<jraregris>when you're supposed to do something else+
(05:14:58)<jraregris>?
(05:15:11)<jraregris>you use eclipse?
(05:15:33)<Fobbah>yeah, i tend to do it while procrastinating. when my schedule's free i'm too busy out drinking and having fun to think about coding lol
(05:15:48)<Fobbah>yeah, fantastic IDE
(05:16:08)<Fobbah>my favorite sound effect so far: http://www.mediafire.com/?fa0wvdmtmgi
(05:16:27)<Fobbah>when you die in this RL, you really know you're dead lol
(05:17:08)<Fobbah>eclipse was always great, and its gotten better over the years as i've been using it
(05:17:39)<Fobbah>i'm always finding new tools built into the thing that make my coding easier
(05:17:41)<jraregris>3.4 is right around the corner too
(05:20:31)<Fobbah>its such a great ide that since the first time i fired it up, every other environment just seemed silly, and i havnt looked back since
(05:21:01)<jraregris>yeah, pretty much me too
(05:21:42)<jraregris>the only thing i find annoying is the package manager
(05:24:07)<Fobbah>what dont you like about it?
(05:25:14)<jraregris>it would be easier if there was some central repository index. at least for the projects hosted on eclipse.org
(05:26:03)<jraregris>I've spent a lot of time wading through eclipse.org looking for update links
(05:26:40)<Fobbah>fair enough, i find the built in software updates take forever so every now and then i just reinstall from scratch
(05:27:46)<jraregris>yeah, I've been fighting a linux installation, so I've reinstalled oftetn
(05:28:18)<Fobbah>lol see now thats why i gave up on linux
(05:28:26)<Fobbah>i realised i was spending more time fighting my OS than getting stuff done
(05:28:36)<jraregris>also, I've set it up with extensions (subclipse, mylyn, etc.) at my computer account on the university
(05:28:57)<Fobbah>sure, its great once you get t up and running, but its always a headache every single time you need to go get a new tool for some simple purpose
(05:29:28)<jraregris>I've come to a solution I'm happy with; I've got dual boot: winxp and kubuntu
(05:29:37)<Fobbah>yeah thats what ive got set up here
(05:29:43)<Fobbah>but dont find much use for kubuntu lately
(05:29:47)<jraregris>use the os most suitable for whatever I'm doing
(05:30:22)<Fobbah>KDE is pretty slick i must admit
(05:30:30)<jraregris>often, if I'm in a hurry, it's faster for me to ssh the university and do whatever unixy thing I'm doing there
(05:30:56)<jraregris>I've got kde4, but I haven't really decided if i like it or not
(05:31:09)<Fobbah>i like it a lot better than gnome
(05:31:42)<jraregris>It seems to lack some setting controls. for instance, I can't seem to turn of system sounds. (like startup and shutdown and error)
(05:34:45)<Fobbah>fair enough
(05:35:20)<Fobbah>at the end of the day i mostly use my machine for 3 things that i dont really have any success with kubuntu though
(05:35:31)<jraregris>but I mostly use winxp
(05:35:46)<Fobbah>1) doing electrical engneering work with a bunch of proprietry packages and math programs
(05:35:57)<Fobbah>2) recording, mixing and mastering audio
(05:36:05)<Fobbah>3) watching media
(05:36:30)<Fobbah>the first two are pretty much impossible due to lack of equivalent software and/or hardware problems
(05:36:43)<jraregris>what do you use for 2?
(05:37:16)<Fobbah>cubase / ableton live mostly
(05:38:39)<Fobbah>got a swag of rackmount gear and a small room i use as a project studio
(05:39:41)<Fobbah>so what's the basic premise for the roguelike you plan on making?
(05:40:31)<jraregris>pretty nonexistant
(05:40:53)<Fobbah>lol fair enough
(05:40:55)<jraregris>I've mostly thought of game mechanics and engine
(05:41:12)<jraregris>the setting will whatever you call the setting of nethack
(05:41:16)<Fobbah>if its your first one odds are you'll go through at least 1 or 2 rewrites
(05:41:45)<Fobbah>although youve got the right idea if you follow the basic ideas of that AI article
(05:41:57)<Fobbah>lemme dig something up that you'll find very useful if you havnt covered it already
(05:42:12)<jraregris>"chronologically confused with a basis in high fantasy hack n slash with an affinity for pop culture references"
(05:42:31)<jraregris>cool
(05:42:35)<Fobbah>haha
(05:42:36)<Fobbah>http://www.policyalmanac.org/games/aStarTutorial.htm
(05:42:58)<Fobbah>that is the bread and butter of your AI code
(05:43:33)<jraregris>cool! i read that article years ago, but couldn't find it again when I actually began to think seriously about ai. superthanks
(05:43:35)<Fobbah>it can be adapted to solve a lot of other interesting problems too
(05:44:01)<Fobbah>i plan on using it for routing corridors in my updated dungeon generator soon
(05:46:17)<jraregris>cool
(05:47:16)<jraregris>i thought about using a hexagonal grid
(05:48:07)<Fobbah>basically i'll build a list of rooms one at a time, then as each new room is placed, select a room at random, and try to path a line from it to the new room that doesnt touch any clear squares
(05:48:25)<Fobbah>hex grid has its ups and downs
(05:48:29)<jraregris>yeah
(05:48:38)<jraregris>you can't have straight walls, for instance
(05:48:43)<Fobbah>the big positive is you can have round LOS thats actually true in terms of movement
(05:48:58)<jraregris>i thought of a way to improve hex
(05:49:25)<jraregris>you can divide a hex into six triangles
(05:50:43)<Fobbah>the idea being?
(05:50:53)<Fobbah>just higher resolution?
(05:50:58)<jraregris>yes
(05:51:34)<jraregris>you could have the character still fill the "old" hex, and then you could move "half a square"
(05:52:17)<jraregris>you could have monsters in different sizes that would actually have an impact on geometry
(05:52:54)<jraregris>i realise that this is very ambtious, and it's pretty far into the horizion for me
(05:53:34)<jraregris>I've got lots of easier stuff to try out first
(05:54:35)<jraregris>it's easy to get carried away. especially when it's so far ahead that you don't visualize it in your code yet
(05:55:35)<Fobbah>monsters of larger sizes is an interesting idea
(05:55:54)<Fobbah>you could have a tank or a really huge demon or something
(05:57:07)<Fobbah>hello EezT
(05:58:03)<jraregris>yes, and you could escape into corridors
(06:00:46)<jraregris>I also get ideas on stuff I'd like to implement in my engine, that I wouldn't necessarily put in my game
(06:01:34)<jraregris>like hex squares, directional LOS
(06:02:13)<jraregris>i could have special hex levels, though
(06:02:39)<Fobbah>directional LOS could be interesting in some types of roguelikes
(06:03:11)<Fobbah>the emphasis would have to be on ranged combat though otherwise it would just be annoying
(06:04:56)<jraregris>maybe I'll make to games in parallell, one which aim is realism (which i think is fun to "figure out") and one which is aimed on fun
(06:05:25)<Fobbah>you can definetely make things interesting by simply adding more depth
(06:05:44)<Fobbah>i always thought dwarffortress's combat was interesting
(06:05:54)<jraregris>i never got so far :)
(06:06:08)<Fobbah>instead of just doing damage to HP, they get hit in body parts
(06:06:11)<jraregris>i like the world building
(06:06:26)<Fobbah>i think dwarf fortress is great so far, but it really needs a proper mouse interface
(06:06:34)<jraregris>ah, yeah, i intend to "borrow" that concept
(06:06:52)<Fobbah>its a very complex roguelike to implement though
(06:07:03)<jraregris>it could help to increase the resolution too
(06:07:35)<jraregris>if I could play it fullscreen with full resolution, I could see the whole fortress in one screen
(06:08:14)<Fobbah>its just that the challenges in developing such a sophisticated world and having so much going on at once while maintaining decent speed make a decent interface seem kind of trivial.. i dont know why the developer is sticking with keyboard and text, it may be against the grain of a roguelike, but in this case its really kinda holding the game back..
(06:08:22)<jraregris>yeah... my gut reaction to problems is usually to over generalize
(06:08:42)<jraregris>oh thought you talked about the body part bit
(06:09:28)<Fobbah>the body part combat is cool and i'll probably do something like that in my next roguelike
(06:10:37)<jraregris>I'd play this: http://spriteattack.cator.de//df/show//dwarf_show.png :)
(06:11:17)<Fobbah>hey thats new?
(06:11:31)<jraregris>don't get too excited, it's a mock up
(06:11:35)<Fobbah>fair enough
(06:11:53)<Fobbah>somebody was working on a really nice tileset for doomRL too that hasnt been implemetned yet
(06:11:59)<jraregris>but it looks really, really good
(06:12:07)<jraregris>cool
(06:12:37)<jraregris>DoomRL has an advantage as it has a good reference on all the art
(06:12:54)<jraregris>as with the sound and music
(06:13:02)<Fobbah>yeah, the art i saw was seriously the best ive ever seen in a RL
(06:13:13)<jraregris>cool
(06:13:40)<jraregris>it was a pretty bold move to put a third dimension in DF
(06:13:47)<Fobbah>http://www.derekyu.com/doomrl/mock-03.png
(06:13:54)<Fobbah>yeah i was really suprised when i heard about that too
(06:14:01)<Fobbah>but it opens up a LOT more possibilities to the game
(06:14:31)<jraregris>unfortunatly i got a lot more confusing, to me at least
(06:14:40)<Fobbah>true
(06:14:49)<jraregris>the doomrl graphics look brilliant
(06:14:57)<Fobbah>i think the game would be much easier with a better interface
(06:15:20)<Fobbah>most of the struggle is figuring out what your dwarves are doing and how you can task things etc
(06:15:21)<jraregris>they're still icons, which is good
(06:15:39)<Fobbah>the current approach just bombards you with so much text you have nfi what any of it is doing
(06:16:04)<jraregris>i agree
(06:16:12)<Fobbah>i find that graphics in a RL tend to be a problem in that monsters and items are rarely clearly defined against the background
(06:16:26)<Fobbah>like in castlevaniaRL for example i can barely ever see the bats until they're right on top of me
(06:17:14)<Fobbah>but those doom sprites are so clear and very good looking too
(06:17:44)<jraregris>the main thing i have against RL graphics is that my imagination is better than the tiles
(06:18:02)<Fobbah>yeah
(06:18:17)<Fobbah>plus when you see a Z or a D you pretty much know what you're in store for
(06:18:23)<Fobbah>or a V
(06:18:35)<jraregris>but in doomRL it looks like doom in my head, and so does the sprites. a perfect match.
(06:18:39)<Fobbah>yeah
(06:20:06)<Fobbah>it helps that the artist is a lot better than usual
(06:20:10)<jraregris>I know it's a very induvidual thing, but I feel kinda sorry for people who can't immerse themselves in ascii
(06:20:26)<Fobbah>lol yeah
(06:20:34)<jraregris>yeah, that's the second issue
(06:20:42)<Fobbah>i think thats the way to go if you're doing a graphical roguelike
(06:21:08)<Fobbah>everyone just does square tiles or isometric
(06:21:42)<Fobbah>square tiles look ugly as hell and have barely any room to draw monsters in, isometric tiles are ok but people tend to draw the walls too high and things are hard to see in general
(06:22:10)<Fobbah>but those square tiles with the ability to draw sprites taller than the tile look great
(06:22:23)<jraregris>you thinking about FF6-like tiles where the tiles have 2.5D?
(06:23:27)<Fobbah>perhaps
(06:23:43)<Fobbah>i was going to go similar to that doomRL screenshot
(06:23:49)<jraregris>yeah, the taller than the square is what i meant
(06:23:56)<Fobbah>maybe even draw up a tileset like that for my next RL
(06:25:00)<Fobbah>hmm speaking of which, check out these FF6 terrain tiles i just stumbled across
(06:25:01)<Fobbah>http://uirpg.com/resources/chipsets/560.png
(06:25:10)<jraregris>it's more important to plan carefully with drawing than with programming
(06:25:32)<Fobbah>they look great, might pinch them for something sometime hehe
(06:25:46)<jraregris>hehe
(06:26:58)<jraregris>instead of ascii-graphics, i think I'll go for unicode-graphics
(06:27:13)<jraregris>in java, it's all unicode anyway
(06:27:34)<jraregris>i might find a use for accents and stuff
(06:28:01)<Fobbah>another tip, use "Monospaced" as your font for your RL, it will look much nicer
(06:28:51)<jraregris>i suddenly hit me how excellent it must be to be a rl dev in china, where everythin already has 1 character
(06:29:13)<Fobbah>haha
(06:29:27)<Fobbah>indeed
(06:37:16)<jraregris>monospaced as font in swing, you mean?
(06:54:41)<jraregris>i already use it
(06:54:43)<jraregris>looks good
(07:23:15)<Fobbah>yeah
(07:24:36)<jraregris>I'm off to do dishes and stuff :(
(07:30:20)<Fobbah>laters
(07:31:55)<jraregris>yeah
(08:24:33)<the_ru>phew
(08:24:36)<the_ru>that was a long log
(08:25:04)<the_ru>...
(08:25:21)<the_ru>and that could be interpreted in any way you want
(08:28:22)<Fobbah>?
(08:48:05)<jraregris>did you hit a touchdown?
(04:35:48)<oeb>Have any of you guys taken a look at Mystery Dungeon : Shiren the Wanderer on the NDS?
(04:36:40)<Fobbah>no, but it looks very cool
(04:37:50)<Fobbah>any good?
(04:37:56)<oeb>Very
(04:38:01)<oeb>I am really enjoying it
(04:38:14)<oeb>It has some interesting ideas to make the game less punishing
(04:38:53)<oeb>For example, the layout is roughly like this. A town, 5 dungeon levels, a town, 5 levels a town, the main dungeon
(04:39:16)<Fobbah>is it very replayable?
(04:39:19)<oeb>In the towns there are warehouses
(04:39:40)<oeb>Got everything a rougelike should have instadeth, random dungeons etc.
(04:40:28)<oeb>How a warehouse works is as follows, if I find an item, lets say a +5 katana this game, I can if I wish leave it in a warehouse.
(04:40:46)<oeb>I can give up the opertuinity to use it in this game to use it in a later one instead.
(04:41:22)<oeb>There are also items called warehouse jars. If I put an item into one of them in vanishes and appears in the first warehouse.
(04:41:35)<oeb>So I can potentially save a good weapon when I die.
(04:41:53)<Fobbah>so basically you're building up an arsenal so eventually you can get through the game?
(04:41:58)<oeb>It makes the game a bit less punishing and therefore more newbie friendly I think.
(04:42:08)<oeb>No, lets say I have a +5 sword in warehouse one
(04:42:18)<oeb>If I take it out this game it's gone from the warehouse.
(04:42:23)<oeb>Even for the next one.
(04:43:10)<oeb>I can give up the opertunity of using an item now to use it later instead.
(04:43:29)<oeb>The magic system is nearly non existant. There are spells but all are in scroll form.
(04:44:09)<oeb>It is possible to find items that are not identified, items can be wear or use identified if they are equipment.
(04:44:15)<oeb>There is also an identify jar
(04:44:28)<oeb>Items are automaticly identified when you go into a town
(04:45:11)<oeb>If you dont eat you die, there are common roguelike themes such as invisible enemys cursed weapons and a polymorph minigame (kinda)
(04:45:34)<oeb>It is no where as complex as even powder, but I think that can be a good thing too.
(04:47:28)<Fobbah>sounds cool
(04:47:34)<Fobbah>shame i dont have a ds lol :P
(04:47:56)<Fobbah>but the world needs more portable roguelikes haha
(04:48:25)<oeb>Some of the enemys are really frustrating in proper roguelike fashion though. For example the fire elementals split like jellies if you use blast attacks on them. I managed to walk into a room with 2 elementals and a bunch of tanks (An enemy with a blast type weapon)
(04:48:41)<oeb>I think when I died (My best char yet) there was 13 elementals in there =/
(04:49:15)<Fobbah>lol but thats the genius of nethacky style sillyness
(04:49:20)<oeb>Yup
(04:49:26)<oeb>It really is a great game
(04:49:39)<Fobbah>its like "kick the sink. i dare you."
(04:50:04)<oeb>As frustrating a roguelike should be, with graphics that would blow a powder player out of the water.
(04:50:25)<oeb>The graphics are quite like the snes zelda style sprites
(04:50:38)<oeb>The world needs more sprite artists who love roguelikes.
(04:51:09)<Fobbah>the thing about roguelikes is they CAN work with sprites, but theres so many examples of where its been done badly that nobody even wants to think about it lol
(04:51:21)<oeb>Nice graphics would make the entire genre more accessible. But then again, it's possible that this game could kindle some serious intrest in the genre.
(04:51:40)<Fobbah>indeed, definitely a good thing
(04:51:52)<oeb>They did simplify the theme, but not enough that you wont recognise it for what it is
(04:52:06)<oeb>It's turn based and everything!
(04:52:17)<oeb>(With different speeds, some can move twice to your once)
(04:52:35)<Fobbah>but yeah people like to try to cram a sprite and a background tile in a 15x15 square, the end result being you dont know what the hell you're looking at and you tend to not notice small creatures etc
(04:53:21)<Fobbah>then theres falcon's eye where the walls are too tall to see anything.. you need it to be soort of isometric so theres a decent amount of room to draw the monsters and items but still being able to see properly
(04:53:26)<oeb>What about a smaller display?
(04:53:33)<oeb>I love playing powder on the pc
(04:53:41)<oeb>It allows for larger sprites.
(04:54:01)<Fobbah>i saw some mockups of sprites for doomRL which seemed to have the right idea
(04:54:38)<Fobbah>http://www.derekyu.com/doomrl/mock-03.png
(04:55:00)<oeb>Did you see that mockup for dwarf fortress?
(04:55:35)<Fobbah>yeah
(04:56:29)<Fobbah>didnt look too clear to me though, i'd rather play something like this http://mayday.w.staszic.waw.pl/~mayday/files/graphic.jpg
(04:56:55)<purestrain>uglyness
(04:57:22)<purestrain>doomrl would be nice beside the fact that everything is stolen
(04:57:28)<Fobbah>ugly but you can see what you're doing
(04:58:07)<Fobbah>that game's interface needs to be totally rebuilt from the ground up though
(04:58:14)<oeb>I agree
(04:58:16)<purestrain>and what the goal then ?
(04:58:18)<Fobbah>its very interesting to play but its a complete mess
(04:59:54)<oeb>That game would work fantasticly with a mouse driven interface.
(05:00:49)<Fobbah>indeed, it reminds me a lot of dungeon keeper, i hope one day it will be that polished
(05:01:06)<oeb>One of these days I'm gonna make a serious attempt at writing a roguelike, just so I can show you folks exactly why more people don't write roguelikes =P
(05:02:13)<oeb>I don't particularly think it needs anything more than the sprites that it does offer (As an option) I just think the menu system needs to be revised. With also possibly a context menu
(05:02:45)<oeb>Click on a carpenters workshop, the menu opens to the right, choose what to build, and away we go.
(05:03:26)<oeb>It's still perfectly useable the way that it is, it's just not very newbie friendly.
(05:03:41)<oeb>Still one of the better stategy games floating around at the moment
(05:05:40)<Fobbah>a game with such a hugely steep learning curve already doesnt need the additional frustration of a clunky interface lol, just seems like a waste to me
(05:06:59)<oeb>You know it happens with any app. I'm sure DF was initially much much simpler and the interface worked fantasticly.
(05:07:12)<Fobbah>indeed
(05:12:31)<joe6pack>oeb: did you read that piece about the development of DF?
(05:13:10)<joe6pack>iirc it was originally more than one game that they connected together into 1 big game
(05:13:41)<oeb>I did not read it actually I don't think
(05:13:54)<joe6pack>it was very interesting 
(05:14:03)<joe6pack>google "the making of DF"
(05:14:07)<joe6pack>or something like that
(05:14:32)<joe6pack>rotateme post it here as a lotd once
(05:14:42)<joe6pack>*posted
(05:14:58)<oeb>Of course it's bound to happen in this kind of enviroment. Most roguelike creators are just developers with a pet project. And few developers are also skilled at the likes of graphics, interfaces and everything else.
(05:15:19)<joe6pack>yea
(05:15:31)<joe6pack>gfx&sound are the main problems as far as i see it
(05:15:35)<joe6pack>imo
(05:16:23)<joe6pack>programmers can easily make a decent living doing what they do, so they don't mind donating some of their time to work on a free game
(05:16:26)<joe6pack>but artists 
(05:16:27)<oeb>A friend of mine runs a game developers community, I will ask him does he know any good sprite artists
(05:16:35)<joe6pack>need every cent they can earn
(05:16:38)<oeb>although it's likely he has the same problems.

(05:17:57)<joe6pack>some of these are nice and you can use them for free
(05:18:21)<joe6pack>oeb: if you want custom made tiles you will most likely need to pay for them
(05:18:24)<oeb>You should see the graphics in that new NDS roguelike
(05:18:32)<joe6pack>link?
(05:18:38)<oeb>It's commercial
(05:18:50)<joe6pack>to screenshots i mean
(05:18:58)<oeb>Mystery Dungeon : Shiren the Wander I think, lemme grab some
(05:19:16)<joe6pack>if diablo didn't push the genre into the mainstream i doubt anything will
(05:19:33)<oeb>This is a proper roguelike
(05:19:38)<oeb>turn based and everything
(05:19:43)<joe6pack>i found some
(05:19:47)<oeb>Diablo was still quite removed from the genre
(05:20:07)<joe6pack>as far as i can see diablo was just a real time roguelike
(05:20:16)<joe6pack>although a bit on the simple side
(05:20:55)<oeb>That is true, but it does not make an acurate impression of the genre.
(05:21:07)<joe6pack>looks pretty 
(05:21:54)<oeb>As a roguelike player you can play diablo and go 'Ohh right, this is a simple realtime nethack', but can a diablo player look at nethack and go 'Ohh this is a more complicated turn based diablo'?
(05:22:11)<joe6pack>nethack must be one of the most popular open source games of all time and even that is barely known outside of our little niche 
(05:22:25)<joe6pack>i don't know,
(05:22:38)<oeb>I think someone who plays that new mystery dungeon game they could pick up, well maybe not nethack but deffinatly powder or something.
(05:22:50)<joe6pack>actually most people i've tried to introduce to RLs didn't see it that way
(05:22:59)<joe6pack>hmm
(05:23:15)<joe6pack>the question is if it
(05:23:28)<joe6pack>'s going to be popular enough to make a difference 
(05:23:33)<oeb>If you could secure a good artist, something like doom rl would be a fantistic tool for getting people into the genre
(05:23:51)<joe6pack>that mock up looks good to me
(05:24:00)<oeb>Well I guess if it brings 100 people into the roguelike scene then it will have done something good.
(05:24:10)<Fobbah>doomRL is a pretty nice game
(05:24:18)<Fobbah>very well polished, if simpler
(05:24:25)<joe6pack>you need more than just a good gfx artist, you need a good sound artist as well
(05:24:26)<oeb>It is one of the best coffee cup games around.
(05:24:40)<joe6pack>yeah i like it as well
(05:24:46)<joe6pack>although i havn't played it in a long while
(05:24:53)<Fobbah>i think the idea of putting sound effects and midi was a good move, people underestimate the importance of sound and music in the whole video game experience
(05:25:03)<joe6pack>yes
(05:25:09)<Fobbah>which is why i decided to put it in my RL i'm working on :)
(05:25:27)<joe6pack>but he can't just use the doom ones if he actually makes it big in any significant way 
(05:25:42)<oeb>I wonder would it be worth while to commission sprite library for roguelikes and release it OS
(05:26:02)<joe6pack>already been done
(05:26:14)<oeb>Which sets?
(05:26:25)<joe6pack>http://rltiles.sourceforge.net/
(05:26:37)<oeb>I suppose as well the problem with that is the fact that they would be hard to change
(05:26:43)<joe6pack>.http://pousse.rapiere.free.fr/tome/tome-tiles.htm
(05:26:57)<oeb>as in the skill level would not be there to change them while maintaing the style.
(05:27:00)<joe6pack>^-- the infamous gervais tiles
(05:27:14)<joe6pack>that is the problem
(05:27:30)<joe6pack>and that is why i said you will need to actually pay someone to achieve that 
(05:27:51)<oeb>Maybe we can kidnap a good designer and lock him in a basement and force him to churn out tiles on demand.
(05:27:56)<joe6pack>there aren't enough artists that are willing to work on it to keep it up in the long run
(05:28:08)<joe6pack>that's an idea
(05:28:15)<oeb>"OI, I need an orc with a broadsword or I'm gonna send Krice down there again"
(05:29:05)<joe6pack>i don't think that's much of a threat. i always pictured krice as a pencil-neck little geek
(05:29:26)<Fobbah>bah, sure you can! and that's why nobody will remember your name ;)
(05:29:31)<joe6pack>especially after his whining about not being able to find a girlfriend 
(05:29:59)<Fobbah>sorry wrong channel lol
(05:30:10)<joe6pack>i was wondering about that...
(05:30:24)<oeb>Yes but every designer loves misguided critisism.
(05:30:29)<Fobbah>lol
(05:30:45)<oeb>"That sucks!!" "Why?" "Because I am better than you and I said so"
(05:32:30)<Fobbah>i wouldnt mind getting those floor tiles from the doomRL mockup and using them myself
(05:33:09)<Fobbah>the whole 2.5d but not isometric look works well
(05:33:50)<Fobbah>so you guys working on any RLs lately?
(05:34:35)<oeb>Who did the mockup?
(05:34:48)<Fobbah>uh hang on and i'll track him down
(05:35:02)<oeb>I am working on thinking about doing a roguelike. Procrastinating as usual.
(05:35:28)<Fobbah>ive got it the other way round
(05:35:48)<Fobbah>working at university physics, procrastinating into roguelike code :D
(05:36:21)<Fobbah>heres the thread i got it from: http://forum.chaosforge.org/index.php?topic=1490.0
(05:37:53)<oeb>Physics is always something I wanted to understand.
(05:38:21)<oeb>Never had the patients for it though. By contrast, my best mate has a degree in Experemental Physics.
(05:41:45)<Fobbah>its more of an electrical engineering subject this one.. electromechanical systems *headache*
(05:42:29)<joe6pack>Fobbah: only my little one
(05:42:32)<joe6pack>cryptrover 
(05:43:27)<joe6pack>and i also got into it the same way you did :0
(05:43:46)<joe6pack>only in math instead of physics  
(05:49:10)<oeb>Actually for a simple RL I may know an artist.
(05:49:47)<oeb>Something like crypt rover could not be too difficult to find one for, one enemy type, a couple of item types and a @
(05:52:54)<Fobbah>ah ive played that one, interesting idea there :D
(05:53:40)<joe6pack>oeb: yes, but i would need to be able to cahnge it
(05:53:42)<joe6pack>for instance
(05:53:55)<joe6pack>now people have asked for treasures...
(05:53:56)<Fobbah>[01:49] <joe6pack> and i also got into it the same way you did :0
(05:53:57)<Fobbah>[01:50] <joe6pack> only in math instead of physics  
(05:53:57)<Fobbah>[01:55] <oeb> Actually for a simple RL I may know an artist.
(05:54:02)<Fobbah>oops odd
(05:54:07)<Fobbah>was trying to paste a link
(05:54:22)<joe6pack>copy paste buffers ftw
(05:54:29)<joe6pack>do you use linux?
(05:54:48)<Fobbah>dual boot in kubuntu and XP
(05:54:59)<Fobbah>mirc just gets a bit funny with copying and pasting
(05:55:44)<Fobbah>off topic - latest build of my RL :) - http://www.mediafire.com/?jsmmvkb9mmf
(05:56:04)<joe6pack>that's not off topic here :)
(05:56:17)<joe6pack>big
(05:56:33)<Fobbah>sound and music included hehe
(05:57:02)<Fobbah>a bunch of sound files in there i'm not actually using which i need to get rid of, and i'll probably convert them to .ogg or something soon to cut down on overall szie
(05:58:06)<joe6pack>cool
(05:58:19)<joe6pack>did you compose it yourself?
(05:58:28)<Fobbah>nah lol, just nicked a lot of music from random old video games
(05:58:34)<joe6pack>heh
(05:58:39)<Fobbah>i might compose some stuff for it though :)
(05:58:41)<joe6pack>the illegal way ;)
(05:59:03)<Fobbah>music is my thing, just dont have the time atm to be mucking around with midi files hehe
(05:59:11)<joe6pack>i never noticed how much it adds to the game before
(05:59:27)<Fobbah>basic controls - 
(05:59:27)<Fobbah>numpad for movement 
(05:59:27)<Fobbah>> - down stairs 
(05:59:27)<Fobbah>< - up stairs 
(05:59:27)<Fobbah>f - fire ranged weapon 
(05:59:27)<Fobbah>r - reload weapon 
(05:59:29)<Fobbah>t - throw grenade 
(05:59:31)<Fobbah>g - pick up item 
(05:59:31)<joe6pack>maybe i'll nick some off of an old game myselg 
(05:59:34)<Fobbah>u - use item 
(05:59:35)<Fobbah>w - wield weapon/melee weapon 
(05:59:37)<Fobbah>e - unwield weapon/melee weapon 
(05:59:39)<Fobbah>s - wait for 1 turn 
(05:59:41)<Fobbah>x - spend attribute points 
(05:59:43)<Fobbah>z - cast spell
(06:00:04)<joe6pack>the music & sound effects make it seem really exciting 
(06:00:17)<Fobbah>basically i dug up my old project that has been collecting dust for almost 2 years and started working on it again
(06:00:35)<Fobbah>i'd gotten all the hard work out of the way, then got bored of it right when i got up to developing the actual content lol
(06:00:36)<joe6pack>do you have a good source for sound files from old agmes?
(06:00:41)<Fobbah>yeah
(06:00:47)<joe6pack>link?
(06:00:52)<Fobbah>you can try searching for video game midis
(06:00:59)<Fobbah>the top couple of sites are great
(06:01:03)<joe6pack>i have a few midis that i've found
(06:01:16)<joe6pack>what about effects?
(06:01:22)<Fobbah>getting them from all over the place
(06:01:26)<Fobbah>not any one source
(06:01:30)<joe6pack>ok
(06:01:45)<joe6pack>but also just by random googleing 
(06:01:49)<Fobbah>just browsing alot, grabbing anything that sounds good.. ive actually got a bunch more that are pretty good i havnt gotten round to stck in
(06:02:00)<Fobbah>that, and i nicked a few short ones from quake that nobody will notice
(06:02:10)<Fobbah>just little ambient effects like gore hitting the ground lol
(06:02:46)<joe6pack>damn now you make me want to work on my game again to add sound...
(06:02:58)<joe6pack>but i have to prepare that semianr for friday :(
(06:03:28)<joe6pack>and actually i am doing neither and am just watching movies and chat on irc ;(
(06:03:37)<Fobbah>hehehe yeah and i have laboratory work to write up
(06:04:42)<joe6pack>i'm gonna log out, one less distraction vector
(06:04:49)<joe6pack>have a nice day everyone 
(06:04:54)<Fobbah>laters
(06:14:33)<the_ru>actually, Diablo used to be turn-based
(06:14:55)<the_ru>and I don't really get the Shiren -> roguelikes connection
(06:15:10)<the_ru>Sure, lots of RL players are discussing it and recommending it to others
(06:15:41)<the_ru>But I doubt a commercial game publisher would say "oh yes, BTW, there's a whole genre of games that's almost like ours, and they're all free"
(06:16:23)<the_ru>http://www.diablo-evolution.com/
(06:39:21)<the_ru>so, anyone know a reliable way to delay a C program?
(06:39:27)<the_ru>in milliseconds
(06:41:26)<Aerton>use a real-time OS
(06:42:28)<Aerton>although, usleep/nanosleep is usually good enough for many things
(06:45:38)<the_ru>I'm thinking about delaying spell "animation"
(06:46:44)<the_ru>it's not a problem if it sleeps for less than the specified time... but it must not sleep for a second for each call
(06:46:53)<the_ru>but that's what such functions tend to do :-/
(07:06:22)<Aerton>usleep/nanosleep are more precise
(08:03:27)<joe6pack>the_ru: afaik any such function will not be platform independent 
(08:03:55)<joe6pack>usleep for unix like Aerton said and Sleep for windows
(08:04:12)<joe6pack>with an upper case S
(08:17:26)<Fobbah>given up on the lack of distraction joe? :D
(08:18:44)<joe6pack>:)
(08:18:48)<joe6pack>yup 
(08:19:07)<joe6pack>who am i kidding, i'm not getting any work done today
(08:19:21)<Fobbah>hehe ive just been mucking around with a bunch more silly features in the RL
(08:19:46)<Fobbah>for instance, the screen now fades red and plays the bond theme when you die lol
(08:20:03)<joe6pack>i would make it play the RIP music from digger 
(08:20:51)<joe6pack>i played that game so much
(08:21:55)<joe6pack>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._2_in_B_flat_Minor_%28Chopin%29
(08:21:58)<joe6pack>that's the one
(08:23:55)<joe6pack>anyone remember this game: http://www.mobygames.com/game/styx
(08:24:28)<Fobbah>i remember qix
+++ The date has changed: 2008/05/13 +++
(05:46:51)<Fobbah>anybody around?
(05:54:48)<Fobbah>howdy
(08:06:13)<the_ru>not really
(08:08:29)<the_ru>I wonder when our client is gonna start complainin'
(08:08:42)<the_ru>I usually drag myself to work around 9 AM
(08:08:49)<the_ru>and leave by 3 PM
(08:09:02)<the_ru>... but in case anyone asks, I was at my real office, doing something
(09:57:08)<oeb>Morning guys
(11:40:00)<the_ru>hello
(11:40:40)<Fobbah>hey
(11:40:44)<the_ru>testing my new advantage keyboard
(11:40:53)<the_ru>LOL
(11:41:18)<the_ru>this sure feels strange to type on
(11:41:33)<Fobbah>is it one of those wierd really widely spilt ones?
(11:42:04)<the_ru>yes
(11:42:59)<the_ru>http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm
(11:43:23)<the_ru>will take some time to get used to
(11:44:33)<the_ru>but since I already touch-type most of the re-learning is already done
(11:44:54)<the_ru>I don't really see any other way to type on this though
(11:45:34)<the_ru>it's weird to have backspace on the left thumb
(11:45:43)<the_ru>and space on the right
(11:46:17)<the_ru>I usually type space with the left thumb
(11:47:21)<the_ru>but I'll get used to it, I guess
(11:51:58)<oeb>300 quid for a keyboard?
(11:52:13)<oeb>Nuts, I thinl I'll stick with my 15 quid dell one =P
(11:52:57)<the_ru>heh
(11:53:00)<Fobbah>does it have dvorak layout on the keys?
(11:53:32)<the_ru>well, it's just money
(11:53:40)<Fobbah>i want to get a keyboard with that printed on them so i can be stuffed to learn it
(11:53:43)<the_ru>you can always earn new
(11:53:55)<the_ru>you only get one pair of arms though
(11:54:05)<the_ru>NO.
(11:54:22)<the_ru>you're doing it wrong
(11:54:44)<the_ru>you must learn to type without looking
(11:55:13)<the_ru>print a dvorak layout and keep it by your monitor
(11:55:16)<Fobbah>i think the most important thing in desk ergonomics is making sure the chair is the correct height relative to the table
(11:55:32)<Fobbah>a lot of people overlook that
(11:55:36)<the_ru>then you won't pick up the habit of looking at the keyboard
(11:56:29)<the_ru>mine has both qwerty and american dvorak actually
(11:56:37)<the_ru>none is useful to me
(11:56:50)<Fobbah>i'm pretty sure i'd get a feel for the layout pretty quickly, i just get annoyed with it when i have to keep openening up an image to see the layout lol
(11:57:04)<Fobbah>wind up getting lazy and going back to qwerty
(11:57:12)<the_ru>I'd prefer blank keys, but they didn't sell such x
(11:57:18)<the_ru>keyboards
(11:57:25)<Fobbah>you can always scrape the letters of the keys
(11:57:34)<the_ru>print it
(11:57:45)<Fobbah>yeah thats probably the way to go
(11:58:10)<the_ru>off a 300 ¬§ keyboard? I think not
(11:58:27)<Fobbah>lol
(11:59:02)<Fobbah>pricey, but if you're working with it all day and you've got a little cash to burn, well worth it
(11:59:04)<the_ru>the point is; regardless which layout you use, don't look at the keys
(11:59:23)<Fobbah>plus you get the amusement of the bewildered look on people's faces when they try to use your computer
(11:59:36)<the_ru>IIRC Jeff Lait has one
(12:00:01)<the_ru>heh, yes
(12:00:38)<the_ru>even a regular keyboard with dvorak makes people go WTF
(12:01:43)<the_ru>I have such a layout printed in my office - everyone that sees it goes o_O
(12:01:57)<Fobbah>lol
(12:02:00)<the_ru>but now, I must depart
(12:02:04)<the_ru>L8R
(12:02:10)<Fobbah>peace
(12:15:53)<oeb>Oddly enough, IRC thought me to touch type.
(12:16:37)<oeb>Since I started using IRC (About 13 or 14 years ago) I have not needed to look at the keyboard.
(12:17:06)<Fobbah>i have no idea when i learned to touch type because ive been doing it from a young age
(12:17:40)<Fobbah>the thing that usually confuses the shit out of me with dvorak is not the letter layout, but trying to figure out where the hell they moved the . | " keys etc
(12:19:10)<Fobbah>but i really ought to get around to it with the amount of typing i do
(12:19:29)<Fobbah>problem is when i try to do it, i'm fixed on doing that and cant do anything else efficently lol
(12:30:34)<oeb>Heh, I love how you can type fine, and find the y on the keyboard when not thininking about it. But if someone was to ask me what keys were next to the y I would not know without looking =P
(12:31:09)<Fobbah>yeah lol, or at least you'd have to sit and really think about it, whereas typing is like instant
(12:32:27)<oeb>When I have to peck type (For example when using one hand) I think I am probably slower than someone who has never seen a keyboard before.
(04:02:14)<the_ru>isn't that called muscle memory?
(04:05:52)<the_ru>time for another test
(04:06:00)<the_ru>roguelike playing!
(04:44:54)<the_ru>yay
(04:45:10)<the_ru>moved tab to delete (on left thumb)
(04:45:32)<the_ru>and replaced the useless windows key with an extra alt
(04:45:55)<the_ru>I've wanted one for the left hand for a long time
(04:47:05)<oeb>Getting used to the layout?
(04:53:17)<the_ru>somewhat
(05:13:59)<the_ru>heh
(05:14:17)<the_ru>I wonder if I should use the number row for special characters
(05:14:25)<the_ru>and use shift for the actual digits
(05:14:58)<the_ru>I use the various braces much more often than the digits
(05:20:19)<oeb>That is actually a really good idea for a coder
(05:21:27)<the_ru>on normal swedish keyboards, curlies and brackets require the use of ctrl+alt
(05:21:31)<the_ru>horrible
(05:22:13)<the_ru>now; which ones are most important?
(05:22:17)<the_ru>;
(05:22:21)<the_ru>()
(05:22:58)<the_ru>hm
(05:23:01)<the_ru>no wait
(05:23:17)<the_ru>AltGr actually
(05:29:10)<Kadwiell>You don't consider {} important?
(05:29:19)<the_ru>yes
(05:29:32)<oeb>A python programmer might not.
(05:29:50)<Kadwiell>Or lisp, given that () came so early in the list :)
(05:29:54)<the_ru>but I currently can't type them :-D
(05:30:08)<the_ru>¬ß<¬ß¬ß¬ß
(05:30:10)<the_ru>hm
(05:30:15)<the_ru>¬¥
(05:30:18)<the_ru>`
(05:30:59)<oeb>The only thing about this, is if you are on holidays and pop into an internet cafe you will be breaking things by the time you leave.
(05:31:31)<Kadwiell>Yeah, that's mostly why I still write on standard qwerty
(05:31:34)<the_ru>when I go on holiday, I try to stay away from computers
(05:31:48)<Kadwiell>I hear it's hard to be "fluent" in more than one layout
(05:32:05)<oeb>Although on the plus side you can build one of those cool chairs with a keypad on each arm rest.
(05:32:18)<oeb>Just like the programmers on the tee vee
(05:33:48)<the_ru>I can't decide what's most important
(05:35:12)<oeb>Hmmm, strange idea
(05:35:33)<oeb>sit { on one key, with shift +{ producing }
(05:36:00)<oeb>Most IDE's require you to use { alot more than } because of auto completion and the like
(05:36:10)<oeb>ditto ( amd ) and [ and ]
(05:59:01)<the_ru>hm
(05:59:18)<the_ru>{[ and }] solved
(05:59:55)<the_ru>now what about the rest :->
(06:12:12)<the_ru>heh
(06:12:31)<the_ru>{.,}
(06:12:38)<the_ru>[:;]
(06:13:18)<the_ru>and 1-0:
(06:13:29)<the_ru><@>-";(*)'
(06:13:43)<the_ru>! left of 1
(06:13:50)<the_ru>+ right of 0
(06:15:58)<the_ru>/|_= to the right
(06:19:05)<Aerton>you know, you can type <% instead of { in C :-P
(06:20:23)<the_ru>huh
(06:20:36)<the_ru>isn't that ASP?
(06:21:23)<jraregris>in norwegian we use ¬´ and ¬ª for quotation marks, but they're not mapped out on a standard norwegian keyboard
(06:22:20)<Aerton>C standard allows to use alternative writings for { } [ ] #
(06:22:33)<the_ru>oh
(06:22:36)<the_ru>I had no idea
(06:22:47)<Aerton><: for [
(06:22:57)<Aerton>%: for #
(06:23:23)<the_ru>can they be mixed? :-)
(06:23:34)<the_ru><:3]
(06:23:42)<Aerton>with normal writing? sure
(06:24:09)<Aerton>it's mainly intended for systems that do not have native support for these symbols
(06:24:55)<Aerton>using them would give your code quite a distinct look :-)
(06:44:26)<RotateMe>the_ru, what were you talking about in the first place?
(06:44:42)<RotateMe>(eg. <@the_ru> {[ and }] solved)
(07:57:14)<the_ru>RotateMe: my keyboard layout
(07:57:30)<the_ru>I got my new Kinesis Advantage today
(08:18:37)<the_ru>I find my roguelike boring
(08:19:07)<the_ru>is it just because I know it too well or did I forget to add the fun in the first place?
(08:26:15)<joe6pack>the_ru: maybe it's just incomplete, or maybe you've played too often 
(08:26:40)<joe6pack>it's like people who play WoW every day for 6 months and then complain it's boring 
(08:27:04)<joe6pack>well, of course it is - did you expect to be entertained by one game for eternity?
(08:27:16)<joe6pack>so I wouldn't worry just yet ;)
(08:27:21)<the_ru>I don't actually play much
(08:27:35)<the_ru>I wonder if I should work a bit on the setting though
(08:27:55)<joe6pack>i can tell you the setting isn't what makes a RL boring or interesting for me
(08:28:09)<joe6pack>it has a lot more to do with the game play
(08:28:39)<the_ru>Yes, of course
(08:28:57)<joe6pack>what is boring about it?
(08:29:09)<the_ru>But my gameplay is fine, the problem is there isn't really anything to do
(08:29:32)<the_ru>I only have vague ideas for the main quest and ending
(08:29:38)<joe6pack>well than add more content
(08:29:42)<joe6pack>side quests 
(08:29:43)<the_ru>I dunno what it is about
(08:29:44)<joe6pack>cool items
(08:29:47)<joe6pack>new monsters
(08:30:05)<joe6pack>it's not that important imo
(08:30:24)<the_ru>but isn't that developing the setting?
(08:30:37)<joe6pack>i like finding something new every now and then.  the hero's main quest doesn't interest me much
(08:30:50)<joe6pack>the_ru: i guess so, but i thought you meant the back story 
(08:31:12)<the_ru>yeah, but it does affect all the rest
(08:31:20)<joe6pack>indeed
(08:31:25)<the_ru>right now I have pretty generic high fantasy
(08:31:32)<the_ru>I want it darker
(08:31:54)<joe6pack>so it is the back story you are talking about
(08:32:07)<the_ru>but it affects so much else
(08:32:11)<joe6pack>what kinds of enemies do you have
(08:32:13)<joe6pack>?
(08:32:42)<the_ru>goblins, elementals, rats, bats, ghouls, mermen, etc
(08:32:53)<joe6pack>devide them to categories for me, each category should be conceptually different than the other ones
(08:32:56)<the_ru>I want demons
(08:33:14)<joe6pack>and tell me what makes each category unique 
(08:33:56)<the_ru>the "vermin" - bats, rats - are mostly just filler 
(08:34:15)<the_ru>the ghouls don't do much except walk around
(08:34:32)<the_ru>the goblins sometimes throw things
(08:34:32)<joe6pack>sounds the same to me
(08:34:36)<the_ru>yeah
(08:34:47)<the_ru>but I want a real setting
(08:34:48)<joe6pack>vermins and ghouls i mean
(08:35:15)<the_ru>not just the standard "anything goes"
(08:35:43)<the_ru>so flame elementals appear next to ancient lizard mammoths and whatever else I can come up with
(08:36:04)<joe6pack>as you wish, but if you want my opinion you should leave it alone, work on the details and the setting will develop by itself
(08:36:35)<joe6pack>you can always change the text descriptions of the monsters 
(08:36:50)<the_ru>I guess so
(08:37:05)<the_ru>but there are settings that affect the gameplay as well
(08:37:07)<joe6pack>for all i care they could all be different types of birds, as long as gameplay-wise they are different 
(08:37:35)<the_ru>what if the player is some kind of supernatural being, that gains strength by absorbing enemies?
(08:37:53)<joe6pack>ok
(08:38:23)<joe6pack>he could be a vampire 
(08:38:43)<joe6pack>gaining propertuies of the beings whose blood he consumes 
(08:38:43)<the_ru>well, at least I don't have {green, brown, black, red, yellow} mold
(08:38:58)<joe6pack>you mean centipede ;)
(08:39:12)<the_ru>that too
(08:39:22)<jraregris>your character could be on a quest to redeem himself for a sinful life or something
(08:39:25)<joe6pack>i think the 1st hour of angband you just kill variously colored centipedes 
(08:39:27)<the_ru>and worms
(08:39:39)<the_ru>I was thinking "fallen angel"
(08:39:41)<jraregris>kinda like `Lone Wolf and Cub'
(08:39:58)<the_ru>you've been banished to a barren world for your crimes
(08:40:34)<the_ru>so you can help the people and eventually gain their worship
(08:40:57)<the_ru>or you can fight your old masters and claim their place as a god of terror
(08:41:03)<the_ru>... or something
(08:41:30)<the_ru>but in the beginning, you're weak like a kitten
(08:43:31)<the_ru>and I want to keep the scale very small
(08:43:40)<the_ru>low powered weapons, etc
(08:44:02)<the_ru>every battle should actually be dangerous, not just target practice
(08:44:51)<joe6pack>yup that's important 
(08:45:04)<joe6pack>that's what made hellband boring for me 
(08:45:20)<joe6pack>it took like 4 levels till i lost the 1st hitpoint
(08:45:24)<joe6pack>or something like that
(08:45:38)<the_ru>or you could be some kind of crusader, set on wiping out a cult or something
(08:45:45)<the_ru>plenty of room for demons
(08:46:01)<the_ru>but it would require a good story to feel involving
(08:46:57)<joe6pack>you keep saying that, but i don't think that's neceseraly true
(08:47:11)<joe6pack>with most games i just skip the story
(08:47:32)<joe6pack>i don't even read it the 1st time.
(08:47:50)<joe6pack>only later if i really liked the game i take a look at the back story
(08:48:30)<joe6pack>a game that is good at it's core will be good regardless of the story
(08:48:30)<the_ru>I don't really need a *story*, but a well developed world
(08:48:37)<the_ru>for it to feel fresh and interesting
(08:48:54)<joe6pack>well i guess that is where we disagree :)
(08:49:55)<joe6pack>after what Fobbah showed me yesterday i am definitely adding music to cryptrover
(08:49:55)<the_ru>I get your point
(08:50:07)<joe6pack>(sometime) 
(08:50:21)<joe6pack>it is ok if we have different opinions,
(08:50:31)<the_ru>but still; I've barely worked on the world at all
(08:50:32)<joe6pack>different people like different things in a gane
(08:51:51)<the_ru>I just don't want a game that doesn't lead anywhere :-/
(08:51:55)<joe6pack>some people play games to get into a new environment, others for the "puzzle solving" value of it
(08:52:15)<the_ru>I've already made one of those
(08:52:31)<joe6pack>it's like the difference between tetris and day of the tentacle 
(08:52:48)<joe6pack>or quake and half life 
(08:53:00)<the_ru>I suppose nethackers don't play for the story
(08:53:09)<joe6pack>probably not
(08:53:16)<joe6pack>nethack is pretty random iirc
(08:53:27)<the_ru>exactly
(08:53:33)<the_ru>I want a stricter theme
(08:53:40)<joe6pack>but the silliness is part of its charm
(08:54:50)<joe6pack>the only reason i actually have a cohesive theme in cr is that it is so small :)
(08:55:07)<joe6pack>but now i feel like working on it again
(08:55:11)<joe6pack>adding stuff
(08:55:37)<joe6pack>first will be the treasures and high scores people have been asking for 
(08:55:40)<joe6pack>then music
(08:55:44)<joe6pack>and sfx
(08:55:56)<joe6pack>after that maybe new types of enemies & items
(08:56:17)<the_ru>I've been writing an engine for three years, I need to decide what the game should actually be about :-)
(08:56:27)<joe6pack>hehe
(08:57:57)<the_ru>right now I'm leaning towards early middle ages
(08:58:09)<the_ru>maybe even viking age
(08:58:13)<the_ru>lots of dark forest, full of strange creatures
(08:58:34)<the_ru>relatively low level of technology
(08:58:52)<joe6pack>how about stone age
(08:59:02)<the_ru>magic is available, but at great cost
(08:59:11)<the_ru>maybe
(08:59:24)<RotateMe>the_ru, you're talking about TSL when saying "your roguelike" or sth else?
(09:00:04)<the_ru>RotateMe: yes
(09:00:46)<the_ru>I don't want to go scifi
(09:00:46)<RotateMe>well that's funny because TSL had a clear setting for me
(09:00:58)<RotateMe>i was in a pyramid and went deeper
(09:01:12)<the_ru>a pyramid?
(09:01:18)<RotateMe>yep, because of the name
(09:01:31)<RotateMe>i associated mummy with something egypt
(09:01:32)<the_ru>a-ha
(09:01:38)<RotateMe>so i thought of a pyramid
(09:01:49)<RotateMe>what i want to say is that the player will make up the setting himself
(09:01:58)<the_ru>well, that wasn't what I intended :-)
(09:02:07)<RotateMe>(but to be honest i really thought that was what you meant)
(09:02:18)<the_ru>It's just a name, since I lacked a better one 
(09:02:32)<RotateMe>it's the best damn roguelike name i know
(09:03:27)<the_ru>I wish it was the best damn roguelike :-)
(09:04:30)<RotateMe>hmm i only played 10 minutes or so because i had lots of problems with ubuntu and the standard keysetting
(09:04:36)<RotateMe>but i liked the variety of items
(09:04:51)<RotateMe>and that you find lots of them
(09:05:06)<the_ru>0.11 supports the numpad, BTW
(09:05:28)<the_ru>actually, the quantity of items is one of the things that bother me the most
(09:05:34)<the_ru>since they're all the same
(09:05:42)<the_ru>that's why I was wondering
(09:06:03)<the_ru>if it's just me, or did I miss something
(09:06:05)<the_ru>along the way
(09:06:31)<the_ru>I suppose I should keep working on it
(09:06:35)<RotateMe>i'm going to play it tomorrow while at the university and will tell you
(09:06:54)<the_ru>Fix problems, add more content and try to tie the various areas together
(09:07:02)<RotateMe>if you think they're all the same, add some events to the items, that's what i'm doing with dungeonhunter
(09:07:18)<the_ru>events?
(09:07:19)<RotateMe>eg. hitting the enemy might clone him (but in return the weapon is very strong)
(09:07:41)<RotateMe>or sometimes your weapon casts random spells
(09:07:45)<the_ru>I have a lot of randomness actually
(09:08:01)<RotateMe>i like that the most
(09:08:18)<the_ru>I'll keep working on it then
(09:09:04)<RotateMe>yep... just think of some fancy non-standard stuff
(09:09:04)<the_ru>I'm planning 0.12 to be a bog fix release, so I'm not very motivated to get started on it :-)
(09:09:23)<RotateMe>and why not take the pyramid, or ancient egyptian tomb or whatever setting?
(09:09:29)<the_ru>but I guess I'll feel better once I'm done
(09:09:35)<the_ru>I have a tomb in the desert
(09:09:36)<RotateMe>you have the name (and thus the boss) already
(09:09:55)<the_ru>Hm, why not
(09:10:09)<the_ru>Perhaps the boss would be there, deep below
(09:10:35)<the_ru>but to open the tomb you must gather ancient keys scattered throughout the world...
(09:10:40)<the_ru>or something
(09:10:43)<RotateMe>the way you represent walls made me think of pyramids too, please don't ask why :D
(09:10:49)<RotateMe>that sounds nice
(09:11:04)<RotateMe>and i think it's pretty much enough of a story for a roguelike
(09:11:16)<RotateMe>rls live through gameplay, unlike JRPGs
(09:11:26)<RotateMe>(like final fantasy etc.)
(09:20:40)<the_ru>hm
(09:20:41)<joe6pack>jebus, people apparently think that just because i post the faq to the newsgroups every few months that i am the holy faq-keeper or something
(09:20:55)<the_ru>I'm going to need a bigger desert
(09:21:16)<the_ru>joe6pack: sounds like you volunteered
(09:21:35)<joe6pack>the_ru: yes but everyone is allowed to change it, they don't need to ask my permission 
(09:21:40)<the_ru>"i post the faq to the newsgroups every few months"
(09:21:51)<joe6pack>the_ru: only because nobody else did
(09:22:34)<the_ru>:-)
(09:22:41)<the_ru>BBIAB
(09:23:03)<joe6pack>just change it and if other people won't like your changes we'll revert them
(09:27:38)<the_ru>wikis are still pretty new
(09:27:51)<the_ru>and usenetters are very traditional :-)
(09:46:23)<joe6pack>guess so
(10:12:26)<the_ru>I bought a stereo today
(10:16:46)<joe6pack_>why am i logged in twice?
(10:17:23)<joe6pack_>wtf i can't kick 
(10:17:28)<joe6pack_>"#rgrd You're not channel operator"
(10:17:32)<joe6pack_>yes i am
(10:18:35)<ido_>wtf is going on here
(10:20:02)<ido_>hrm
(10:20:04)<ido_>odd
(10:22:08)<joe6pack>hopefully that solved it 
(11:44:55)<the_ru>Hm
(11:45:05)<the_ru>I'm slowly getting used to this keyboard
(11:45:29)<the_ru>I'll have to convince my boss to buy me one for the office as well
(11:45:51)<the_ru>It feels like once I get used to this, there's no going back
(11:47:46)<joe6pack>model m?
(11:47:56)<the_ru>no
(11:48:03)<the_ru>Kinesis Advantage
(11:48:12)<the_ru>http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm
(11:48:20)<joe6pack>huh
(11:48:24)<joe6pack>looks funky 
(11:48:32)<joe6pack>i ratehr have a normal keyboard 
(11:49:10)<joe6pack>doesn't look like it has all the keys
(11:49:19)<the_ru>sure, if you want twisted and tormented fingers... :-)
(11:49:50)<joe6pack>more to do with wrists than with fingers 
(11:50:17)<joe6pack>i used to get wrist ache in the past
(11:50:21)<joe6pack>but havn't in years
(11:50:48)<joe6pack>i guess my chair/desk have better ergonomics 
(11:50:59)<joe6pack>the hight of the keyboard/mouse etc
(11:51:20)<the_ru>well, easy finger placement helps prevent wrist ache :-)
(11:51:35)<joe6pack>ok
(11:51:43)<the_ru>I really don't like the "almost diagonal" layout on normal keyboards
(11:51:59)<the_ru>having straight rows is easier
(11:52:17)<the_ru>+ with this one, I can remap keys easily
(11:52:24)<the_ru>even system keys
(11:52:40)<joe6pack>you can remap keys on any keyboard
(11:52:44)<joe6pack>at least if you use linux
(11:52:46)<the_ru>I've already moved my tab key and added a second alt
(11:52:58)<the_ru>yeah, but this works on hardware level
(11:53:02)<joe6pack>i normally replace caps lock with a 2nd ctrl
(11:53:29)<the_ru>it can also be used for macros, but I haven't learned how to program those yet
(11:54:14)<the_ru>but I guess the most important thing is to have a good chair and table, and take breaks :-)
(11:54:34)<the_ru>I have a "stress ball" that I squeeze
(11:55:29)<the_ru>oh damn
(11:55:39)<the_ru>almost half the month has passed alreadyp
(11:57:48)<Fobbah>deadlines creeping in eh?
(11:58:41)<the_ru>more like life ticking away :-)
(11:58:47)<Fobbah>lol
(11:59:20)<the_ru>Fobbah: do you use a recursive room splitting algorithm in your RL?
(11:59:37)<Fobbah>i use a couple of algorithms, and i'm about to improve upon them
(11:59:37)<the_ru>it looks like it on the screenshot at least
(11:59:58)<joe6pack>night
+++ The date has changed: 2008/05/14 +++
(12:00:16)<Fobbah>i'm going to write up a dungeon generator that builds a list of rooms and uses A* to link them together
(12:00:34)<the_ru>I've been struggling with mine for a few months, so I guess I'm quite used to seeing its output :-)
(12:00:43)<the_ru>hm hm
(12:00:48)<the_ru>sounds sophisticated
(12:00:50)<Fobbah>but theres currently 3 different generators in there which i'll use for differnent levels
(12:00:59)<Fobbah>thats how nethack style dungeons are generated
(12:01:15)<the_ru>not always
(12:01:23)<Fobbah>usually they are
(12:01:45)<the_ru>I had such dungeons earlier, and I didn't have no A* :-)
(12:02:06)<the_ru>not that my brute force approach was better, though...
(12:02:09)<Fobbah>honestly, if you already have pathfinding built in, it doesnt sound any more difficult than writing the normal dungeon generator stuff.. you just kinda build a list of rooms without worrying about linking them up, try to link them all with A* and then remove any rooms found to be unreachable. piece of cake
(12:02:35)<Fobbah>so all you have to check for is if they intersect when placing them rather than being adjacent, and the pathfinding does the work for you
(12:03:02)<the_ru>m-hm
(12:03:17)<Fobbah>in fact it sounds easier than my current method of *search for wall* - *build out from wall*
(12:03:25)<the_ru>I started by building a room, then building corridors in random directions, etc
(12:04:02)<the_ru>I think I'm still using a horribly mutated version of that code actually
(12:04:19)<Fobbah>mine just needs a complete rewrite
(12:04:43)<Fobbah>i'm keeping the old generators so i can use them throughout the game for more variety, but i'm going to do a new one from scratch
(12:04:59)<Fobbah>anyways sadly i must bounce, got an appointment. catch you later maybe
(12:05:05)<the_ru>yes
(12:05:20)<the_ru>we shall meet again
(12:05:29)<the_ru>muahahahahahahaha!!!
(12:05:41)<the_ru>or as nethack says
(12:05:45)<the_ru>xaxaxaxaxa
(12:07:09)<the_ru>I think I'm getting tired
(10:27:22)<Fobbah>moo!
(10:27:54)<Fobbah>just thought i'd break the silence seeing as nobody's said a word in the 10 hours since i went afk lol
(10:28:40)<oeb>You spoiled it =(
(10:33:55)<Fobbah>hahaha
(12:56:24)<the_ru>lsd

(10:10:59)<the_ru>what do you think of hitpoints?
(10:11:18)<the_ru>I'm pondering giving my creatures a small number of them
(10:11:35)<the_ru>and let each attack take one HP
(10:12:01)<the_ru>then weapons would just have a to-hit modifier and not a damage score
(10:12:09)<the_ru>what problems will arise?
(10:14:29)<purestrain>try it
(10:14:56)<purestrain>but i don't think using only hit modifiers will be good
(10:24:31)<purestrain>also it means, you can get stronger and better, but a creature will always require 3 hits e.g.
(10:24:53)<the_ru>yes
(10:25:14)<the_ru>but I'm not sure how my weapons should work
(10:25:26)<the_ru>right now damage =
(10:25:36)<purestrain>traditional? just dealing with damage values ?
(10:25:42)<the_ru>damage = strength + weapon damage
(10:26:07)<the_ru>I want to keep them very low powered
(10:26:22)<the_ru>but they grow too powerful too fast
(10:27:00)<purestrain>what about e.g. damage = base_weapon_damage + (addition_weapon_damage / 10 * strength) ?
(10:27:02)<the_ru>i.e. unarmed = base damage 1, dagger = 2, sword/mace = 3
(10:27:43)<the_ru>I don't think fractions will work well, I'm using very small numbers
(10:27:47)<purestrain>could you tweak weapons with other attributes like armor penetration? knockout value?
(10:28:14)<the_ru>some have random effects, some have to-hit modifiers, all have speeds
(10:29:08)<the_ru>so weapons that do a lot of damage could maybe be balanced by being hard to hit with, and taking more time than a lighter weapon
(10:29:50)<the_ru>I dunno why I've been so fixated on discrete numbers lately :-/
(10:30:18)<purestrain>that are the things i hate... e.g. a realtime strategy game: you can build a battleship for $2000, but you could also build 20x smaller ones for each $100;
(10:30:45)<purestrain>both are balanced to win equally ;-)
(10:30:58)<purestrain>why should one weapon with high damage harder to hit ?
(10:31:09)<the_ru>because it's usually heavier
(10:31:30)<the_ru>a hammer or axe, for example
(10:31:59)<the_ru>swords and daggers allow more finesse, but don't hurt as much...
(10:32:02)<the_ru>or something
(10:32:25)<the_ru>ah, yes - weapon skill also modifies damage right now
(10:33:23)<the_ru>so with a mace (3), +1 strength and +2 mace skill, you'd do 6 points of damage at most
(10:34:03)<purestrain>hmm... if i'm a experiences sword fighter, should i deal more damage or should i hit more often?
(10:34:10)<the_ru>both
(10:34:21)<the_ru>perhaps I should just make powerful weapons more rare
(10:34:34)<purestrain>perhaps... perhaps i've got to go to bed now ;-)
(10:34:35)<purestrain>n8
(10:34:43)<the_ru>not the standard "go to town, sell 500 spare longswords"
(10:35:02)<the_ru>perhaps enemies should just fight with sticks and stones
(10:35:08)<the_ru>l8r
(10:43:38)<the_ru>perhaps I should set the technology level of the setting somewhere on the brink between neolithic/bronze and iron age
(10:44:06)<the_ru>most high fantasy are closer to industrialization

(11:11:21)<joe6pack>really?
(11:11:29)<joe6pack>you must have pretty odd hardware
(11:11:59)<joe6pack>the 1 thing i like about it is that it autodetects pretty much whatever hardware i throw at it

(11:15:37)<the_ru>In reference to Hel, V√∂lusp√° states that Hel will play an important role in Ragnar√∂k by emphasizing a crowing "sooty-red cock from the halls of Hel" in Hel as one of three that will signal one of the beginning events of Ragnar√∂k. The other two are Fjalar in Jotunheim and Gullunkambi in Valhalla.[1]
(11:15:49)<the_ru>I sure hope they are talking about a bird
(11:16:23)<joe6pack>that sounds like klingon mythology 
(11:59:25)<Perdurabo>hey
(11:59:49)<Perdurabo>this is the roguelikedev channel?
+++ The date has changed: 2008/05/15 +++
(12:05:32)<Perdurabo>*pings channel*
(12:06:19)<joe6pack>yes
(12:06:49)<Perdurabo>oh hey, we're alive ;-)
(12:07:01)<joe6pack>not for long, i'm going to bed soon :)
(12:07:16)<joe6pack>but the_ru and jomiolto will keep you company 
(12:07:20)<Perdurabo>anyway, I just found this place, I hate introductions, but I'm the mad idiot trying to rewrite Kharne after 7 years
(12:07:45)<joe6pack>never played it
(12:08:00)<joe6pack>are you dave?
(12:08:03)<Perdurabo>old unfinished windows gui RL from the millenium
(12:08:05)<Perdurabo>yep, I am
(12:08:29)<Perdurabo>just thought I'd pop in and add this place to my boomarks
(12:08:36)<Perdurabo>err, boomarks even. argh, it is late
(12:08:50)<Perdurabo>arsebiscuits, my spelling has went crap
(12:08:58)<Perdurabo>bookmarks even
(12:09:05)<Perdurabo>heh
(12:09:09)<joe6pack>i like boomarks better 
(12:09:26)<joe6pack>i am barely able to stay awake myself though, 
(12:09:35)<joe6pack>and i have to get up early tomorrow 
(12:10:10)<joe6pack>g'night
(12:10:13)<Perdurabo>night
(12:15:59)<Perdurabo>and night from me as well
(07:29:16)<Fobbah>boo!
(12:18:55)<Fobbah>anybody around?
(12:38:02)<oeb>Morning Fobbah
(12:41:33)<oeb>Hmmm, random roguelike idea #145: You play an angel of death, each level is a different town village or city that you are sent to punish. Difficulty ranges from oposition to specific requirements (Destroy temple without killing, kill all x, kill no y etc)
(12:42:41)<oeb>Hmm, actually I like that idea. I'm gonna email it to myself
(12:51:07)<Fobbah>haha thats a good one
(12:52:13)<Fobbah>runs against the grain in that you'd probably start out being reasonably tough, but it would make a very entertaining game :)
(12:54:47)<oeb>Well you could start off as a noob angle.
(12:54:59)<Fobbah>i guess hehe
(12:55:17)<oeb>"Here is your spoon of slaying! Badgers have desicrated our holy warren. Teach them a lesson!"
(12:56:30)<Fobbah>at some point maybe you could kill the odd wayward nethack character trying to convert an altar or something lol
(12:56:38)<oeb>Haa haa
(12:57:01)<oeb>Your god could grant you spells and equipment.
(12:57:25)<oeb>This could actually make a fun little coffee break roguelike. It might be suitable for my first ever real attempt at one.
(12:57:46)<Fobbah>it would take a lot of thought to make it work properly, because you're really doing something different
(12:57:54)<oeb>Not really
(12:58:02)<oeb>It could start simple.
(12:58:30)<Fobbah>you cant just look at another RL and say "yeah, so i'm going to make it work like that", unless you're just going to be diving down through dungeon levels killing stuff and the only connection with the theme is the names of the monsters etc
(12:58:34)<oeb>I'll have to get out my notepad this evening and start jotting down ideas.
(12:58:46)<Fobbah>the key thing will be the structure of the dungeon i think
(12:58:51)<oeb>Nahhh, every 'level' will be one quest.
(12:58:58)<oeb>And it's more likely to be overworld.
(12:59:41)<Fobbah>if you work it right it would be simple enough, although i suggest filling levels with more guys, and make the player tougher to make up for it
(12:59:48)<oeb>Even bring the later game up to 'modern' day. Tanks and stuff shooting at you.
(01:00:13)<Fobbah>so you would have spells that literally kill everything in a 5x5 area or something like that
(01:00:14)<oeb>A fun mental image, and angel ripping tanks apart in an act of vengance.
(01:00:23)<oeb>Yes
(01:00:29)<Fobbah>but there being enough guys around to still make it challenging
(01:00:32)<oeb>Alot of meat sheilds.
(01:02:20)<oeb>Well, ideally the trouble to your player would be heros, for example an early town may consist of one or two low level charachters who may be a bit of a challenge then loads of flack.
(01:03:06)<oeb>For example a generic spear man is unlikely to be much of a threat, but a couple of them when the local priest is after paralysing you? That's a different matter.
(01:03:32)<Fobbah>thats a pretty good idea, so say you're killing villagers or whatever, and you have spells and abilities that REALLY obliterate them and can do almost nothing to you at all, and make the fight between you and the real soldiers/heroes
(01:03:58)<Fobbah>but the objective is to bring the vengeance or whatever
(01:04:05)<oeb>Aye
(01:06:15)<oeb>Envisioning massive battles between and angel and some mages now. The evil mages summoning hoards of demons, and the angel laying waste to them with waves of holy fire.
(01:06:30)<oeb>I could get Jack Chick to endorse it.
(01:06:33)<oeb>Haa haa
(01:07:03)<oeb>"Here is your fiery sword, your quest is to kill the devil worshiping roleplayers!"
(01:08:02)<oeb>Never know, this may actually be the idea that gets me up off my ass.
(01:09:05)<Fobbah>what you think you'll write it in?
(01:09:35)<oeb>No idea, it's been years since I did anything other than PHP. I guess I could re-learn Java or C#
(01:09:46)<oeb>My c++ was never at a decent level.
(01:10:59)<oeb>Hmmm, HP and Mana could be worked off one stat, piety or holy anger or something.
(01:11:31)<oeb>To represent the fact that it is hard to keep you on the plane of existance.
(01:12:20)<Fobbah>java and c# are both good choices. if you go with java i suggest you dont use the AWT graphics to draw characters on a terminal
(01:12:36)<oeb>If it was java I would just use tiles.
(01:12:54)<oeb>Is there a version of curses available for java?
(01:12:59)<Fobbah>even in that case, probaby go with an open graphics library
(01:13:06)<Fobbah>yeah, jcurses
(01:13:11)<oeb>Any good?
(01:13:26)<Fobbah>dunno, i'm thinking about converting my RL to it though
(01:15:13)<Fobbah>theres pretty much no documentation on the thing so i dont know what its really capable of
(01:16:32)<oeb>I may have to take a stab at it.
(01:16:48)<oeb>I guess I get to work on the 15 steps tonight so.
(01:16:49)<Fobbah>but theres so much overhead in the g.drawString command in java's awt that i cant get more than 20-30 FPS which is pretty pathetic
(01:17:27)<Fobbah>doesnt hurt the game too mcuh but you do notice the sluggishness a little, doesnt feel as polished, and if you want to do any nice little animations its a pain
(01:17:56)<oeb>Aye
(01:20:26)<oeb>Hmmm, different gods could have different skill sets. For example the god of death might have an avatar with a rotting touch, who summons the villages own dead back to create havoc.
(01:24:02)<oeb>The god of war might be represented by a towering armored foe who takes less damage from attacks but has spells that are less descructive (Rain of arrows etc)
(01:24:35)<Fobbah>theres a lot of different ways you can run with it
(01:26:17)<oeb>I'm gonna have fun writing all these down and doing nothing with it =P
(01:27:57)<oeb>It's been years since I have even done any OO programming
(01:28:56)<Fobbah>in a roguelike you're going to be using a lot of OO if you want your code not to cough splutter and die after 2 days lol
(01:29:16)<oeb>Well java kinda forces you to be OO.
(01:29:40)<Fobbah>thats why its a good language for the job. not because of any explicit features but the way you tend to code in java
(01:30:22)<Fobbah>the trick lies in getting a good data structure set up, i base everything from a superclass and work from there using abstraction
(01:32:27)<Fobbah>a cool thing i came across in java lately is the serializable interface, it really saved me a lot of effort in terms of saving/loading
(01:33:31)<oeb>All I remember from interfaces is that they are a nice way to do something like, you have a map generator interface and then an implementation for wilderness, one for dungeons, one for mines etc.
(01:34:06)<Fobbah>well the serializable interface basically lets you take an object and output it in an objectoutputstream so you can save it directly to a file
(01:34:37)<Fobbah>you can designate classes as "transient" in their definition and it wont attempt to save them
(01:35:00)<oeb>much like serialize() works in PHP so.
(01:35:09)<Fobbah>so you have a top level class running the game, and the whole gamestate can be stored in one object, and its just a matter of saving it
(01:35:48)<Fobbah>whats more, while it winds up being about 500kb for my game atm, if you compress it in zip format, i can bring the size of the entire saved gamestate down to about 20kb
(01:36:11)<Fobbah>which is all the data and mobs from all the levels, as i pregenerate my dungeon
(01:36:41)<oeb>Ohh I'm looking forward to this now.
(01:36:45)<Fobbah>so i'll probably implement a library or whatever to compress the output, but all and all, its very nice and easy
(01:37:07)<Fobbah>literally this is my savegame function
(01:37:32)<Fobbah>FileOutputStream f_out = new FileOutputStream("./saves/" + pname + ".data");
(01:37:41)<Fobbah>ObjectOutputStream obj_out = new ObjectOutputStream(f_out);
(01:37:47)<Fobbah>obj_out.writeObject(hub);
(01:37:59)<Fobbah>System.exit(0);
(01:38:12)<Fobbah>and bam, the game is saved in 4 lines if you count shutting down the RL
(01:38:53)<oeb>So that basicially grabs the state of every object that's not transient?
(01:39:11)<Fobbah>yep
(01:39:20)<oeb>And saves it so you can I would assume readObject(); later?
(01:39:36)<oeb>That's a pretty damn simple way to handle it.
(01:40:02)<Fobbah>its pretty simple, i have to redefine a few things
(01:40:10)<Fobbah>but more or less you read the game object straight back in
(01:40:14)<Fobbah>with all of the data
(01:41:12)<Fobbah>hell i even save the JFrame and JPanel etc
(01:41:22)<Fobbah>works fine
(01:41:31)<Fobbah>tried moving the save file from system to system, no problems
(01:45:41)<oeb>Think my boss would notice if I opened up a JAVA IDE instead of ZEND?
(01:45:53)<oeb>Probably not I bet.
(01:46:06)<Fobbah>hahaha
(02:16:33)<RotateMe>i think i asked before, but can anybody recommend a good c++ book?
(02:16:53)<RotateMe>(i found a good c book and read it before, so...)
(02:18:36)<oeb>I have tried to learn c and c++ from so many books. I find that I just can't. It's much easier to just start a project and learn as you go on.
(02:19:04)<Fobbah>i agree
(02:23:02)<RotateMe>i'm working on a project but it happens too often right now that i learn new stuff that would have helped me before a lot
(02:37:21)<segfaulted>http://www.research.att.com/~bs/3rd.html
(02:40:24)<RotateMe>thanks
(02:50:53)<oeb>I don't know is this any good. I have been hosting it for years. http://4o3.net/technetium/
(02:53:33)<RotateMe>hmm not really what i'm looking for but thx
(02:53:45)<RotateMe>got me a torrent with 10 books from 2007 or so
(02:53:57)<RotateMe>will scan through them and buy the most appropriate
(03:20:14)<oeb>Ho hum, tomorrow I am handing in my 3 weeks notice at work. I bet he is going to hit the roof.
(03:33:28)<the_ru>just code
(03:33:41)<the_ru>and you'll learn along the way :-)
(03:39:25)<RotateMe>^^
(03:55:23)<the_ru>so I got fined for a parking offence today >:-|
(03:56:22)<Fobbah>parking tickets are lame
(03:56:29)<the_ru>50 euro
(03:56:39)<the_ru>but I'll get it back somehow
(03:56:54)<the_ru>I'm gonna steal traffic signs or something
(04:30:04)<jraregris>YEAH!
(04:30:28)<jraregris>bow before the power of THE OPERATOR!
(06:05:44)<the_ru>np: disarmonia mundi - venom leech and the hands of rain
(06:17:49)<the_ru>hm
(06:18:24)<the_ru>what do you think
(06:18:36)<Fobbah>?
(06:18:39)<the_ru>if I have a wooden stick, and apply a knife to it, it becomes a spear
(06:18:57)<the_ru>how would one go about to produce a staff?
(06:19:24)<Fobbah>lol, limited usefulness i suppose. you're going to have to put a lot of work in for there to be much point in crafting items
(06:19:50)<the_ru>yes
(06:20:16)<the_ru>in the case of making spears, it doesn't need much code though
(06:20:59)<the_ru>applying oil could create a torch
(06:22:15)<the_ru>applying a nail could make it a spiked club, that does slightly more damage
(06:22:46)<the_ru>or even applying a rock could produce a very primitive stone club
(06:28:05)<the_ru>Ultima had complex item interactions
(06:28:17)<the_ru>baking bread, the classic example
(06:28:24)<the_ru>get flour
(06:28:30)<the_ru>put flour on table
(06:28:33)<the_ru>get water
(06:28:41)<the_ru>mix water and flour
(06:28:48)<the_ru>move dough to oven
(06:28:50)<the_ru>wait
(06:28:56)<the_ru>done!
(08:06:49)<purestrain>hmm... i'm currently reading krice' blog
(08:07:14)<purestrain>he tells that kandurias dungeons are not grid based, but they look pretty grid based http://bp2.blogger.com/_ilDjn0PWliA/SB8S_T_cWFI/AAAAAAAAACA/-lcuiH_njes/s1600-h/corr.jpg
(08:31:56)<jomiolto>yeah, there are some funny things in the Kaduria blog: "Kaduria has small amount of bugs, but they seem to be hard to fix." :D
(08:53:40)<Kadwiell>Huh, I think he means something like "each room can be embedded in a cell of a square grid" by "grid-based"
(08:53:55)<Kadwiell>I don't know if any roguelikes actually do it like that..
(08:54:26)<purestrain>i don't understand your sentence =D
(08:55:23)<purestrain>i'm getting closer and closer on working again on my roguelike
(08:55:52)<purestrain>and again i'm thinking about switching to a realtime game
(08:56:47)<Kadwiell>If you first draw a grid out on graph paper, and then draw each room entirely inside one cell, it's going to be pretty trivial to connect the rooms afterwards
(08:57:02)<Kadwiell>The downside is that the dungeon might look a bit boring
(08:57:36)<purestrain>ah, ok... no i did understand
(08:57:57)<Fobbah>my dungeon generator is giving me headaches :|
(08:58:17)<Kadwiell>Thinking about a realtime roguelike, or something non-RL? I recall somebody showing a pretty nice demo video of a realtime RL game
(08:58:25)<Fobbah>getting there though, revamping it to do it with a list of rooms & A* pathing of corridors
(08:58:38)<purestrain>realtime roguelike
(08:59:34)<Kadwiell>I think it can work, but it's going to feel pretty different from "normal" RLs
(09:00:29)<purestrain>of course, but it would allow for some better tension
(09:01:02)<purestrain>more like diablo ;-)
(09:01:06)<purestrain>but without the nice graphics
(09:01:08)<purestrain>:-(
(09:01:45)<purestrain>yeah, i think i'm going for it... but this time without handheld support
(09:21:28)<Fobbah>5 hours later and ive got some sort of functioning nethack-style dungeon generator
(09:21:41)<Fobbah>pathfinding is always a bitch to debug :|
(09:22:54)<purestrain>why? isn't it just a bunch of nodes?
(09:24:47)<Fobbah>well couple it with the actual generation of the dungeon itself, its basically a lot of code to write at once, and it doesnt work at all until you've got it all done. hence there being about 10 mistakes hidden around the place and it not working at all at first lol
(09:27:54)<Fobbah>but this is what i came up with: http://img115.imageshack.us/img115/8708/effpathdungeonmp7.gif
(09:29:00)<Fobbah>still havnt implemented the code to remove isolated rooms, but i wrote the algorithm in a way to make that pretty easy, and theres the odd corridor that doesnt go anywhere which i'm not sure what is causing
(09:29:13)<Fobbah>but its looking pretty cool :)
(09:30:34)<purestrain>http://retroforge.de/%7Emd/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/map.png <- fear this !
(09:31:43)<Fobbah>nice
(09:32:12)<Fobbah>but it looks like theres only 1 way into each room if i'm not mistaken? like a big maze
(09:33:27)<purestrain>i see multiple rooms with 2 or more doubled doors
(09:34:21)<Fobbah>oh theres rooms with 2 entrances
(09:34:35)<Fobbah>what i mean is its like a maze in that there are a lot of dead ends
(09:35:12)<Fobbah>a few randomly placed doors wouldnt go far astray i think, but thats trivial, the map itself is great
(09:36:31)<Fobbah>so basically it creates a simple network of roads, then generates the rooms by recursive algorithms?
(09:37:00)<purestrain>no
(09:37:42)<purestrain>http://rafb.net/p/BWi5Db97.html <- thats the lame code behind
(09:39:05)<Fobbah>thats how the code looks to me at first glance too
(09:39:21)<Fobbah>or are the rooms done first
(09:39:35)<purestrain>it first creates the rooms, then it creates the corridors around each sector
(09:39:45)<Fobbah>i see
(09:40:01)<purestrain>nothing special, nothing funny, nothing interesting
(09:40:27)<Fobbah>the recursive division is good at filling space though :)
(09:41:30)<purestrain>i'm using recursive algorithm for almost everything... even for caves, the only difference is that each 'sector' in a cave is painted with a more random border and some sectors are just tunnels
(09:42:48)<Fobbah>i'm working on as many different generation algorithms i can for my RL so theres more variety in the levels
(09:43:10)<Fobbah>i'll have to have a play around with that code :)
(09:43:53)<Fobbah>if you dont mind?
(09:44:19)<purestrain>no; do u use D, too? or c++?
(09:44:56)<purestrain>http://rafb.net/p/sIOTFA68.html <- mighty action classes
(09:45:15)<Fobbah>my RL is written in java, but your algos are very clear and easy to read
(09:49:46)<Fobbah>anyways i must be off to bed, its like 8 in the morning
(09:49:52)<Fobbah>peace
(09:51:37)<joe6pack>bye
(09:56:48)<purestrain>joe6pack, didn't you want to write a rts ?

(11:40:58)<oeb>Never actually got around to making a map generator yet, so I guess this is as good a time as any to start
(11:41:21)<jraregris>you're making a rl in php?
(11:46:28)<oeb>nope, but I have not started relearning a real language yet, so I want the theory behind creating an actual random generator.
+++ Start of log: Sun May 18 11:31:26 CEST 2008 +++
(11:42:29)<deveah>the channel suddenly looks operatorish
(11:42:43)<joe6pack>better?
(11:42:56)<deveah>i'm in contrast with you all :p
(11:42:59)<joe6pack>:)
(11:43:33)<joe6pack>always have to be different, don't you?
(11:43:36)<deveah>i wonder what's the simplest way to make metabells
(11:43:42)<deveah>*metaballs
(12:00:26)<Fobbah>no matter how many room types i put into this dungeon generator i still get the feeling it's a tad bland and needs more variety lol
(12:09:41)<deveah>Fobbah: try different terrain, add water, grass etc
(12:10:20)<Fobbah>yeah doing a little of that hehe, actually kinda getting somewhere now
(12:11:03)<Fobbah>getting more and more happy with the output anyway, although i wish i wasnt doing this in unicode now, i dont have all the best tiles from ascii for drawing maps
(12:11:34)<deveah>you make the rl in java, am i right?
(12:11:44)<Fobbah>spose i could change fonts and use the unicode stuff for those, or bite the bullet and convert the thing to jcurses or bitmapped fonts
(12:12:00)<deveah>yes, jcurses would look good
(12:12:03)<Fobbah>i really need to switch to some sort of bitmap font solution anyway, because graphics.drawString is SLOW.
(12:12:09)<joe6pack>Fobbah: dooesen't unicode contain all ascii chars as well?
(12:12:18)<Fobbah>yeah, but the java fonts dont contain them
(12:12:34)<Fobbah>so you get a nice big bunch of unknown character box things
(12:12:40)<joe6pack>i see
(12:12:45)<deveah>try FreeBasic or C++ for a programming language
(12:13:10)<joe6pack>you can get away with java i think
(12:13:13)<Fobbah>screw that, java works fine, its just the command that's slow because it only uses vector fonts
(12:13:20)<joe6pack>there are plenty of RL's written in java
(12:13:46)<Fobbah>so i will just draw up a bitmap texter of an ascii font and draw the characters myself
(12:13:51)<deveah>my top 5 programming languages are
(12:13:52)<Fobbah>*texture
(12:13:55)<deveah>1. BASIC
(12:13:58)<deveah>2. C++
(12:14:01)<Fobbah>or use jcurses
(12:14:03)<deveah>3. C
(12:14:11)<deveah>4. LOLCODE
(12:14:19)<deveah>5. Sinclair BASIC
(12:14:26)<joe6pack>that's a subset of basic
(12:14:37)<deveah>yes, but it's tottaly different
(12:14:55)<joe6pack>FOOD
(12:15:07)<deveah>you can count freebasic as a different programming language too, because it supports any .h or .c as a .bas
(12:15:15)<deveah>and it's speeedy
(12:16:20)<Fobbah>java is getting reasonably fast these days
(12:17:17)<deveah>yes, and it consumes more and more ram\
(12:17:19)<deveah>*ram
(12:17:37)<Fobbah>its standard 2d graphics library could use work, but there are plenty of faster libraries out there, or you can hook into opengl
(12:17:50)<deveah>java, in my opinion, is good only for mobile phones and other java-only devices
(12:18:26)<Fobbah>admittedly the JRE uses a fair amount of ram, but i find for really oo heavy implemetations like this it's my first choice
(12:18:34)<deveah>try making your rl on the mobile phone, it would look much much better
(12:18:54)<Fobbah>mucked around with programming for midp devices. it's a colossal pain in the arse.
(12:19:06)<deveah>i know, i tried too :D
(12:19:31)<the_ru>deveah: so how much Java programming have you done?
(12:19:46)<deveah>hello world : die
(12:20:03)<Fobbah>the problem is every manufacturer has to have the files compiled specifically for their phone, even if the base code would work on all of them. the reason this is hard is they make it all but impossible to actually find and set up the tools you need to do so
(12:20:07)<deveah>the ide was open for 2 minutes!
(12:20:53)<the_ru>deveah: ok, and you can seriously say "Java sucks" based on than?
(12:20:54)<deveah>Fobbah, try the 128x160 standard, or 240x320
(12:21:20)<deveah>no, but i've used many java-made programs and they seriously ate all my ram
(12:21:27)<Fobbah>you can compile to a standardised midp format that will be accepted abroad?
(12:21:34)<deveah>OTOH, java is good for its portability
(12:21:40)<Fobbah>interesting
(12:22:04)<deveah>or try autochanging size, like Dweller
(12:23:30)<Fobbah>i just remember working with an old nokia, giving up on that because the phone was really slow back then, then trying to work with a sony ericcson but their developer support materials were scattered on their websites like it was some sort of fucken labyrinth
(12:24:03)<Fobbah>i did have a little fun with it and implemented chess and stratego on my really old phone though :)
(12:24:04)<deveah>buy a nokia 5310
(12:24:41)<Fobbah>well come to think of it, i got dweller to work on my current sony ericsson k850i (just got it 2 days ago), so i should be able to develop something that will fire up on that too
(12:26:33)<deveah>what's its screen size?
(12:27:31)<Fobbah>240 x 320 if i'm not mistaken
(12:27:33)<Fobbah>hang a sec
(12:28:15)<Fobbah>yep
(12:28:34)<deveah>it's almost exactly like my nokia 5310
(12:29:00)<Fobbah>nice screen too, no blurring or trails like my older nokia phone used to have (although pretty much all phones have quick, bright, clear lcds on them these days)
(12:29:39)<Fobbah>i was tossing between it and a nokia n95 but went with this for lack of moving parts and supposed greater battery life
(12:36:50)<the_ru>hm
(12:36:57)<the_ru>I don't even have a private cellphone
(12:37:08)<the_ru>OTOH, I have a work phone with flat rate
(12:37:49)<Fobbah>on the flipside i dont even have a landline right now :D
(12:38:03)<the_ru>:-)
(12:38:12)<the_ru>no need to have one, really
(12:38:13)<the_ru>we
(12:38:22)<the_ru>we do, just to get ADSL though
(12:39:09)<Fobbah>land line rental is kind of expensive, and i have a capped phone plan that i never hit
(12:40:15)<Fobbah>its like $39 AUD a month for "$300" worth of calls, which is like getting about $200 worth of an equivalent cheaper non capped plan
(12:42:47)<Fobbah>but these days its more expensive for me to have a landline than a mobile :S the telecoms industry in this country is retarded sometimes
(01:16:05)<the_ru>Australia?
(02:06:03)<Fobbah>yeah australia
(02:10:12)<the_ru>ok
(02:10:23)<the_ru>long distances?
(02:10:40)<the_ru>but perhaps you live in a central location...
(02:10:45)<Fobbah>nah just monopolistic telecoms industry
(02:11:00)<the_ru>hm
(02:11:06)<the_ru>they removed 
(02:11:16)<the_ru>the monopoly here (almost) a few years back
(02:11:25)<the_ru>but I'm not sure things are really much better now
(02:11:34)<Fobbah>theres a duopoly of sorts in place
(02:11:58)<the_ru>the majority of the 9000 different companies offering their services only do so in southern sweden
(02:12:08)<Fobbah>one company controls just about all the standard copper telephone lines, and by extension ADSL
(02:12:40)<Fobbah>the other has a fairly large cable tv network, and runs phone services through the same lines as their tv/internet
(02:13:20)<Fobbah>all the ADSL companies in australia buy access to the first company's network
(02:14:08)<Fobbah>but if you're outside the second company's network you're stuck paying the first company for phone line rental for any ADSL service, $20 a month for phone services you wont use
(02:14:33)<Fobbah>just for the connection itself, not paying for a realistic phone plan
(02:15:19)<Fobbah>if you want a proper landline you're looking at about $60 a month which is retardedly expensive
(02:15:39)<the_ru>heh
(02:15:42)<the_ru>about the same as here
(02:16:05)<the_ru>organization-wise, price-wise I don't nkknow
(02:16:34)<Fobbah>so i'm moving to a new place outside the reach of the cable internet network now
(02:17:26)<Fobbah>so when i switch to ADSL i'm going to have to pay for a goddamned landline phone number if i want it or not *grumbles*

(06:57:16)<greg>hum is anybody here who know good articles about random river making ? i have search during long times but find nothing interresting
(06:59:49)<greg>woups my english is horrible :s sorry 
(07:02:36)<joe6pack>i remember something like that
(07:02:44)<joe6pack>but i don't remember where i've found it

(07:03:39)<joe6pack>maybe this thread will have some asnwer
(07:03:40)<joe6pack>s
(07:03:42)<greg>i have tryed to build an algorithm like the A * algo but it produce too unrealistic river
(07:03:47)<greg>thanks a lot
(07:03:50)<joe6pack>no problem
(07:04:58)<joe6pack>there were other discussions on that subject in the newsgroup 
(07:05:01)<joe6pack>http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.development/search?hl=en&group=rec.games.roguelike.development&q=river&qt_g=Search+this+group
(07:05:04)<greg>and it is for a world map ^^ 
(07:06:36)<Fobbah>dunno how effective it would be, but i thought maybe try A* algorithm with some randomization of the heuristic might have interesting results
(07:06:56)<greg>thanks great newsgroup, it is very interesting 
(07:07:08)<Fobbah>might not work too well when each square's G score gets overwritten but worth a try :P
(07:07:26)<joe6pack>http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/mountains.gi93.html  <-- found this in the link from the thread 
(07:09:04)<greg>yeap i have already tried that: a star with some "height score" and some random movement it is not effective at all :) 
(07:09:22)<greg>lunch time
(07:09:35)<greg>thank for your help 
(07:10:20)<greg>i have printed the article on fractal mountain ^^

(09:46:57)<joe6pack>:|
(09:47:04)<joe6pack>too much work irl
(09:47:14)<Fobbah>yeah, thats why i'm up at 6am in the morning
(09:47:17)<joe6pack>need some mind numbing entertainment 
(09:47:36)<joe6pack>6am?
(09:47:41)<joe6pack>aren't you polish
(09:47:54)<Fobbah>australian
(09:47:55)<Fobbah>you?
(09:48:06)<joe6pack>austria atm
(09:48:16)<joe6pack>don't know why i thought you're polish
(09:48:32)<Fobbah>a bunch of people here are from poland i think
(09:48:37)<joe6pack>yes
(09:49:08)<joe6pack>many more are from finland/sweden/norway
(09:49:20)<joe6pack>and few are from germany as well

(09:53:13)<joe6pack>it smells nice
(09:53:29)<joe6pack>it just stopped raining 
(09:53:30)<Fobbah>smells nice?
(09:53:33)<Fobbah>oh lol
(09:53:46)<joe6pack>was kind of stuffy for the past few days
(09:54:20)<joe6pack>did any of you watch "in bruges"?
(09:54:26)<joe6pack>i just did yesterday

(10:44:29)<joe6pack>yeah but not the only Scandinavian

(10:45:16)<the_ru>jraregris is norwegian, jomiolto and Glowie are finnish
(10:45:33)<the_ru>possibly some more that I haven't talked with much
(10:47:38)<joe6pack>you guys are all over the place
(10:47:58)<joe6pack>even if ignore for a moment the fact that finland is not in scandinavia ;)
(10:48:31)<the_ru>it isn't?
(10:48:39)<the_ru>I've always thought of it that way
(10:48:52)<the_ru>but perhaps that's because I live so close to it

(12:13:36)<the_ru>The ergot sclerotium contains high concentrations (up to 2% of dry mass) of the alkaloid ergotamine, a complex molecule consisting of a tripeptide-derived cyclol-lactam ring connected via amide linkage to a lysergic acid (ergoline) moiety, and other alkaloids of the ergoline group that are biosynthesized by the fungus.
(12:13:43)<the_ru>...
(12:13:44)<the_ru>ok.

(04:22:53)<the_ru>just added mark/recall spells
(04:34:23)<the_ru>why, why
(04:34:43)<the_ru>do people still split things into multiple rar files?
(04:37:40)<jraregris>maybe because if you corrupt on of the files, you won't have to redownload the whole archive, just the one corrupt files
(04:51:28)<the_ru>hm
(04:51:40)<the_ru>but it's a torrent - don't those have hash checks anyway...
(04:51:59)<jraregris>yes
(04:52:19)<jraregris>and if your file came over corrupted, they download that file again
(04:52:40)<jraregris>or that that cluster or or that part or
(04:52:43)<jraregris>or whatever :P
(04:52:55)<the_ru>yes, but then it is already divided
(04:53:22)<jraregris>true. i got your point while typing. :)
(04:53:34)<jraregris>maybe the true warez-sceneres still use floppies
(04:54:49)<rnv>it's a usenet thing faik
(04:55:03)<rnv>but for torrents it's pretty stupid 
(04:55:55)<rnv>because you'd have to keep the rars around to seed instead of just the file you wanted 
(04:58:21)<jraregris>yeah
(04:58:54)<jraregris>i liked edonkey/mule/random equine better, because lot's of peple shared whatever they had laying around
(04:59:22)<jraregris>it's next to impossible to get a hold of a single song
(05:34:01)<the_ru>yes
(05:34:42)<the_ru>I don't understand why anyone would put together a torrent like "the 2000 best songs in the universe!!! (7 gigs of music!!!)"
(05:34:52)<the_ru>still, they do
(05:37:18)<rnv>you can pick individual files just fine

(05:50:35)<Kadwiell>Warez traditions aren't always based on brilliant, logical ideas.. I seem to recall that it was pretty common to "compress" things several times with different formats, trying to squeeze those last few bits of entropy out
(05:50:52)<Kadwiell>It's possible they just still use RAR because that's what makes them the "cool" kids
(06:25:51)<jraregris>rnv: Yeah, I know I can pick induvidual files, but then someone has to deem the file worthy of inclusion on the `2000 best songs of the millenium' first.
(06:30:02)<rnv>yeah i get what you mean

(11:32:38)<joe6pack>guess so
(11:32:56)<joe6pack>most of the activity is a bit earlier

(11:33:40)<joe6pack>i guess none of us released anything major recently

(11:34:20)<joe6pack>in feb/mar when a lot of people created 7drls there was a lot of activity

(11:34:52)<Perdurabo>with a quantum-physics based RL
(11:35:11)<joe6pack>well actually i think most od us have released in the past...
(11:35:22)<joe6pack>that should be interesting

(11:35:44)<joe6pack>wave/particle weapons? 
(11:35:59)<joe6pack>or is that some other part of physics...

(11:26:32)<TMC>yeah, I suppose most of them are really bad rogue style room generators
(11:26:46)<TMC>or the same random caves everyone has
(11:26:48)<TMC>but even the good ones seem to be a lot simplier than what I'm doing...
(11:27:22)<Fobbah>only way ive been able to do decent dungeons is by generating a list of rooms first, then using pathfinding to plot corridors between them
(11:27:50)<Fobbah>all the ones ive seen are based on selecting a random wall on the map, then drawing out from there, which sounds like a good idea but doesnt really work well
(11:29:12)<Fobbah>also if you build a list of rooms, and select rooms from a not joined list and move them to a joined list as you successfully plot paths to them, you can actually very easily fill in any rooms which are isolated later
(11:32:12)<TMC>there was a interesting article about the Rogue generation scheme somewhere
(11:32:28)<TMC>I don't know how good it is; I've never played rogue
(11:32:52)<oeb[a]>My town one is really simple. Pick a size, pick a space, see does it fit. If it fails 5 times quit.

(12:46:22)<oeb[a]>A little bit of history =)
(04:39:40)<jraregris>:O
(04:40:41)<deveah>what?
(04:41:06)<RotateMe>wat
(04:41:33)<joe6pack>:O
(04:41:48)<deveah>a guy on EsperNet usually says :O or =0 on everything you say
(04:41:52)<deveah>for example
(04:42:15)<deveah>deveah: MilkyTracker is awes0me!
(04:42:20)<deveah>str0be: =0
(04:57:24)<deveah>dem0scene =o
(05:02:59)<RotateMe>    for (unsigned int i=0; i<targetList.size(); i++) {
(05:02:59)<RotateMe>        targetList.erase(targetList.begin()+i);
(05:02:59)<RotateMe>    }
(05:03:26)<RotateMe>does this delete all objects in the vector?
(05:03:53)<RotateMe>i have the feeling that it doesn't but my debugger won't let me look at a vector :(
(05:10:00)<jraregris>Milkytracker is awesome, actually.
(05:14:48)<joe6pack>RotateMe: there must be an easier way 
(05:15:11)<joe6pack>like some delete all function 
(05:15:13)<deveah>jraregris - you're a musician, too?
(05:23:57)<RotateMe>joe6pack: vector.clear()  "^^
(05:24:14)<joe6pack>yes...
(05:24:33)<jraregris>deveah: yeah, I'm tracking some
(05:26:50)<RotateMe>didn't help though... making a routine to cycle through enemies in view is either not easy or i'm doing it the wrong way
(05:27:59)<RotateMe>deveah: Milkytracker looks nice indeed
(05:31:27)<jraregris>especially if you're used to fasttracker ii
(05:32:41)<joe6pack>RotateMe: 
(05:33:10)<joe6pack>for (int e=0; i<enemy_list.size(); e++)
(05:33:27)<joe6pack>if (enemy_list[e].in_view())
(05:33:28)<joe6pack>...
(05:33:30)<joe6pack>?
(05:33:54)<RotateMe>nope... the game is realtime and continues while you have an enemy targeted
(05:34:01)<RotateMe>it's just an X on his body
(05:34:13)<RotateMe>so i have a list of beings that have been targeted before
(05:34:22)<joe6pack>i don't see what this has to do with anything
(05:34:23)<RotateMe>if it's on the list it can't be targeted
(05:34:45)<RotateMe>if no more target can be found the list is emptied
(05:35:11)<RotateMe>i don't see what this has to do with anything -> i can't do it the for (...) - way
(05:40:16)<RotateMe>(the for loop is part of it of course)
(05:43:25)<the_ru>jraregris: anything I might have heard?
(05:45:47)<joe6pack>RotateMe: why not?
(05:46:34)<joe6pack>i don't know how you've structured your code but i think you can have an iteratable list of all enemies if you really want to...
(05:47:15)<RotateMe>yeah i've implemented like i said, there's no real problem, it's just pretty buggy
(05:48:19)<joe6pack>ok
(05:49:41)<RotateMe>works now, thx
(05:50:17)<RotateMe>the error involved drawing the x over the enemy, not the cycling code
(05:50:21)<RotateMe>:D
(05:51:45)<joe6pack>glad to have been of assistance ;)
(05:55:10)<deveah>can i see some chips, jraregis?

(06:24:01)<deveah>made some quick collection of chips
(06:47:04)<jraregris>ah.. was away a bit.
(06:47:21)<RotateMe>nice stuff amongst it
(06:47:34)<RotateMe>the roguelike horror tune is still the best
(06:47:39)<jraregris>the_ru: you've probably not encountered any of my music :)
(06:47:44)<RotateMe>(cht)
(06:48:43)<RotateMe>iterators are evil :( if i add elements in my vector, iterators on that vector may not be valid anymore
(07:01:21)<purestrain>roguelike horror tune ?

(07:14:26)<jraregris>I never finish my modules, but here's three ideas i jotted down the last month http://oddmundo.com/mux/
(07:24:50)<deveah>yay! snif!
(07:26:02)<deveah>i understand you're svenzzon of titan
(07:26:26)<deveah>milo of titan
(07:26:40)<deveah>and orion/4th dimension ?
(07:27:48)<deveah>your tracking style is nice
(07:29:20)<jomiolto>http://ratonland.org/img/articles/bunny-pancake.gif
(07:31:09)<deveah>nevermind
(07:31:21)<deveah>you could easily join a demogroup
(07:33:09)<jomiolto>that reminds me of the time I was invited to a warez group :D
(07:33:20)<deveah>what was its name?
(07:33:29)<deveah>razor 1911? :p
(07:33:30)<jomiolto>I have no idea, since I declined
(07:33:38)<jomiolto>it was by some scriptkiddies, I think
(07:33:42)<deveah>oh
(07:34:26)<jomiolto>I used to regular on some c and asm groups on IRCnet, and they thought I would have made a good coder for their group :)
(07:36:29)<jomiolto>hmm, and I have actually released a couple of demoscene related things, although I've never been in any group
(07:40:30)<jraregris>deveah: | am none of those. I just haven't bothered changing song info.
(07:41:30)<deveah>i realised later :/
(07:41:36)<jraregris>I was in a group called TiTAN a long time ago. (with milo, who's intruments i took), and coincidentially the people who make Milkytracker call themselves Titan as well.
(07:41:36)<deveah>i mean :p
(07:41:50)<deveah>no, it's the same TiTAN
(07:41:57)<deveah>omg, TiTAN
(07:42:07)<deveah>my favourite group ^^
(07:42:10)<jraregris>no, it's not the same. :)
(07:42:26)<jraregris>i didn't co-found the milkytracker-one
(07:43:10)<jraregris>we decided TiTAN was a to generic name, as dozens of other groups used the same name
(07:43:21)<jraregris>so now we're Illithid instead
(07:43:35)<deveah>milkytracker is developed by a single guy, who joined TiTAN when the 0.90.50 version appeared
(07:43:38)<jraregris>haven't stumbled across anyone else by that name yet
(07:44:08)<deveah>i used to be in a "band" of chipartists
(07:44:11)<deveah>the Zeroes
(07:44:14)<jraregris>nice
(07:44:19)<deveah>but we split :/
(07:44:41)<deveah>and now I'm in CyCorVallen for the title and Binary Brothers for the demos
(07:45:45)<jraregris>the last years I've been more caught up in traditional bands doing the regular rock/punk/folk stuff
(07:46:13)<jraregris>i made a homepage for illithid a couple of months ago: http://illithid.org/
(07:46:17)<jraregris>it's pretty retro
(07:49:21)<purestrain>http://retroforge.de/~md/begin.mp3 <- fear that... my last attempt in modtracker
(07:54:24)<deveah>i see we all "track"
(07:54:46)<deveah>cya
(07:54:54)<jraregris>haha
(07:54:55)<jraregris>bye
(07:55:43)<purestrain>everyone tracking, everyone programming roguelikes
(07:56:02)<jraregris>hehe
(07:56:09)<jraregris>everybody has a band :P
(07:56:18)<purestrain>me not =D
(07:56:37)<jraregris>like in old hong kong movies - everybody knows kung fu!
(07:56:45)<jraregris>*going to eat
(08:09:14)<the_ru>heh
(08:09:30)<the_ru>I have three bands
(08:09:38)<the_ru>... but two are just one-man efforts so far
(08:09:47)<the_ru>waiting for the rest to show up
+++ The date has changed: 2008/05/21 +++
(10:45:23)<oeb[a]>Right, tonight back to coding.
(10:46:15)<oeb[a]>I will either have to try and figure out doors, or else pester the crap out of you guys to find out about using colour in pdcurses, the stuff I found online did not seem to work so I am probably missing something stupid.
(10:48:24)<oeb[a]>Also played another DS roguelike last night which brought up some more valid ways to attract new players to the genre.
(10:48:51)<oeb[a]>By god I wish more roguelike developers could afford decent artists. Both those DS games are beautiful.
(02:07:01)<TMC>is someone arguing that 2GB is a reasonable amount of memory for a RL to use??
(02:23:41)<oeb[a]>What?
(02:24:22)<oeb[a]>I thought the little leak in firefox that caused it to use 700mb was bad.
(02:32:47)<TMC>hmm, I've never had it that bad
(02:46:57)<jraregris>are you talking about the wilderness-map-conversation on rgrd?
(03:28:09)<oeb[a]>In your experience, is a linked list easier for storing maps with than a 2d array? What other options are there? All I have used up to now is an array, but it gets a bit awkward from time to time.
(03:36:32)<Kadwiell>If you have rectangular maps of constant size an array sounds like a sensible solution
(03:38:48)<Kadwiell>How were you considering using linked lists?
(03:45:45)<TMC>what ever happened to links of the day?
(04:16:47)<oeb[a]>Kadwiell, I have never used them before. I thought the fact that each list can point to multiple other lists would make it easier to calculate things like pathfinding and fov.
(04:17:34)<oeb[a]>As in I could use a list to point to all connecting tiles, and also have it keep information such as weather or not the tile is passible, what items are in there etc.
(04:20:02)<TMC>hmm
(04:20:08)<oeb[a]>At the moment I am specificially using an array of 'tile' structs.
(04:20:13)<TMC>what are them?
(04:20:25)<oeb[a]>What? Linked lists?
(04:20:40)<TMC>ah 
(04:20:49)<oeb[a]>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list
(04:21:17)<oeb[a]>I saw them refrenced somewhere in rgrd, by Krice I think, and looked them up afterwards.
(04:22:27)<oeb[a]>From what I have read it's kinda like you have a bunch of structs, and each one points to a bunch of related structs while also containing some other information.
(04:22:36)<oeb[a]>I need to read more though.
(04:24:07)<TMC>horray for people who never took any programming classes!
(04:24:42)<TMC>I've seen a couple inventory implementations using linked lists
(04:24:45)<TMC>like in nethack
(04:24:59)<TMC>each container is a linked list (and so are sub containers)
(04:26:02)<oeb[a]>I once did a programming class. It was pretty basic though. All this PHP has fried my brain anyway.
(04:26:12)<oeb[a]>I keep putting $ before my variables in C =P
(04:29:45)<oeb[a]>Wow, everyone is dropping off the web today
(04:36:26)<Kadwiell>In my experience, structures like linked lists are most useful when you need to be able to "grow" them dynamically, adding more members
(04:37:55)<Kadwiell>It's not a bad idea to use them in pathfinding("growing" a path), but I don't think you really need to have your map as a linked list of tiles, unless you have a very weird map structure
(04:51:59)<oeb[a]>I assumed you could kind of grow your path over your map. I have not implemented any kind of path finding yet, I just assumed it would be easier to calculate from lists than an array.
(04:52:39)<oeb[a]>Is the normal way it is done to generate a list that maps out your array and calculate them from that? If so what is the point in having both? Or am I getting all confused again.
(04:54:15)<Kadwiell>Well, if you look up A* on Wikipedia, you'll see references to things like queues and paths.. those are generally implemented by linking structures together
(04:54:30)<RotateMe>nope, the normal (a*) pathfinding has nodes which is kind of a linked list, but more like a tree structure
(04:55:08)<oeb[a]>I have had an article on a* recomended to me on a web site, Amit's game programming I think. It's on my reading list atm =)
(04:55:15)<RotateMe>it's like you said, it grows it over the map and when it reaches the target, you can go through the nodes backwards
(04:55:48)<RotateMe>there's not really much more to it when i think about it
(04:56:18)<RotateMe>some conditions when nodes die (like when the path is already longer than the shortest found) but that's about it
(04:56:51)<jraregris>If you make your map a LL you can get really dynamic about how the thing works
(04:56:52)<RotateMe>i'm currently doing a real-time strategy roguelike, a* will be too slow for this :(
(04:58:01)<RotateMe>yep, generating it as a linked list in the first place makes it VERY easy to do pathfinding, but you have to have a second structure on how to represent the map i guess
(04:58:27)<jraregris>Like if every cell has a east, west, north, south, up, down-pointers
(04:58:39)<oeb[a]>Why RotateMe?
(04:58:43)<Kadwiell>Does that really make things easier? Can't you just use coordinates where you would use pointers?
(04:58:59)<oeb[a]>Can't a list contain more than links? For example information on what is actually in it?
(04:59:04)<jraregris>you can use the 'current'-cell as 'starting-cell' and draw the ones it links to
(04:59:31)<jraregris>oeb[a]: yeah, it usually does
(05:00:16)<RotateMe>oeb&Kawdiell: if you create valid paths on your map as linked list and then create a map from those pathes with references to the ll, you don't have to do pathfinding at all
(05:00:50)<oeb[a]>That's actually a pretty good idea, that's basicially generating the paths when you generate the map right?
(05:01:01)<jraregris>it could result in a sort of 'text-adventure'-style world
(05:01:11)<oeb[a]>But does that basicially give you a path from everywhere to everywhere?
(05:01:23)<RotateMe>yep... reminds of a boardgame world i guess
(05:01:24)<jraregris>like if you go down, left, up, right, you might not end up where you started
(05:01:46)<RotateMe>hmm
(05:01:51)<RotateMe>yep
(05:02:13)<jraregris>but it could be intersting
(05:02:19)<RotateMe>but that's no problem, you could make one element in the list contain of several tiles
(05:02:29)<jraregris>Portals would be supereasy to implement
(05:03:14)<RotateMe>crazy stuff someone has to implement this!
(05:03:34)<RotateMe>i'm busy finding some neat realtime and fast pathfinding algorythm
(05:03:45)<oeb[a]>And I'm shit yet. =P
(05:04:53)<RotateMe>google gives me that: [PDF]
(05:04:54)<RotateMe>Neural Networks for Real-time Pathfinding in Computer Games Abstract
(05:05:18)<RotateMe>don't think wc3 does that though ^^
(05:05:58)<Kadwiell>A* is too slow for your purposes?
(05:06:46)<oeb[a]>Would I be correct in saying pretty much all I need to do in c to make a linked list is stick a pointer in a structure to related lists?
(05:07:20)<Kadwiell>Yes, pretty much
(05:07:23)<Kadwiell>struct node {
(05:07:24)<oeb[a]>For example struct map { struct map *up; struck map *down; } etc
(05:07:27)<Kadwiell> int data;
(05:07:31)<Kadwiell> struct node *next;
(05:07:32)<Kadwiell>}
(05:08:18)<Kadwiell>The above is the "linked list" proper(though of course what sort of data you use is arbitrary.. many structures can be implemented with similar techniques
(05:08:26)<oeb[a]>Stand by for lots of me being confused and looking for help here later btw =P
(05:08:51)<Kadwiell>I think what you're describing is really a directed graph
(05:09:31)<oeb[a]>Is that another data structure?
(05:11:05)<Kadwiell>More of a mathematical concept, but add data to each vertex it'll be one, I guess
(05:11:11)<Kadwiell>*if you add
(05:11:45)<RotateMe>Kawdiell: I would think A* is too slow...
(05:11:58)<RotateMe>how many units on how big maps can it take?
(05:13:14)<Kadwiell>I think it's supposed to be pretty fast, but the memory usage can be bad
(05:13:46)<Kadwiell>But if you accept nonoptimal paths I suppose you can find them much faster
(05:14:57)<RotateMe>problem is, the map has much more free space then in most roguelikes... it's more like a strategy game map
(05:15:26)<oeb[a]>What alternitives are there to a*?
(05:16:22)<Kadwiell>RotateMe: Perhaps you could use "waypoints" to find a rough outline of an acceptable path?
(05:16:40)<Kadwiell>And then switch to full-detail pathfinding when you get close to your goal
(05:16:58)<RotateMe>yep i will do that
(05:17:25)<RotateMe>there are few spots where real good pathfinding is required and i could just stuff them with waypoints
(05:18:42)<Kadwiell>Like narrow passages and such?
(05:20:10)<Kadwiell>I always have problems with those, because I think they actually require more than good pathfinding - NPCs have to sometimes "cooperate", wait for their turn and get out of the way..
(05:20:58)<Kadwiell>In Tribe I ended up making all hallways very wide because of this, I think movement would otherwise be very annoying with all the nonhostile NPCs around
(05:22:16)<RotateMe>yep, but since my game is realtime it's not such a big problem, skipping their turn means just waiting 1 frame and try again
(05:22:50)<RotateMe>if they enemies approach the player the even make place for each other so they can smash him from every direction
(05:22:53)<RotateMe>http://gamedevelopment.com/features/19970801/pathfinding.htm
(05:23:00)<RotateMe>a good sumup of most stuff there is
(05:26:52)<oeb[a]>Lots of stuff here too : http://www.gameai.com/pathfinding.html

(10:02:14)<the_ru>hi
(10:12:21)<the_ru>hm
(10:12:43)<the_ru>trying to add a character status screen, but I'm wondering if I really need it
(10:58:06)<oeb>To display intersincs and the lot? Or stats and stuff
(10:59:10)<oeb>I have done no coding tonight. Reading up all about linked lists and trying to decide where to go from here. I'm at a really early stage so it's safe enough to decide from here I think.
(11:18:22)<the_ru>oeb: yes, that kind of stuff
(11:18:42)<the_ru>I already display most if it in the status display
(11:18:47)<the_ru>that uses half the screen
(11:20:27)<the_ru>and I don't have much in the way of intrinsics yet anyway
(11:20:44)<the_ru>I'm pondering having a system of "awards"
(11:20:59)<the_ru>that you get for completing certain objectives, solving quests, etc
(11:21:55)<the_ru>for example, running an errand for the thieves guild could give you a "shady contacts" award, that would give a reaction and haggling bonus when dealing with such shady types
(11:24:40)<the_ru>it would be somewhat similar to the "facet" system I used in HASAD
(11:24:51)<the_ru>but facets were implemented very poorly
(11:25:26)<the_ru>the idea was that each character would start out as a very rough and generic stone, that would be cut into a gem
(11:29:04)<the_ru>depending on what ordeals you go through, some character paths would close and new ones would open up
+++ The date has changed: 2008/05/22 +++
(12:20:33)<oeb>That's a pretty neat idea
(12:21:27)<oeb>I.E. being respected by the theves guild may mean that you are looked apon negativly by the local police force kinda thing.

(09:27:31)<oeb>I used the first version of VS.net when I used to work as a c# programmer many life times ago. The last VC I used was 6.0 too though
(09:30:23)<purestrain>its quite good for c# / vb.net, but not for c++
(09:30:33)<purestrain>i'm working with c# at work too
(09:33:41)<oeb>I forgot everything I knew about programing for desktop applications thanks to six years of PHP
(09:34:06)<oeb>I am pretty much learning c from scratch now, I don't remember a thing about it.
(09:56:24)<oeb_werk>Some of this NDS homebrew is awsome.
(09:56:37)<oeb_werk>The Slot1 SD reader I got is great.
(09:56:43)<Fobbah>i was tempted to get into NDS homebrew development
(09:56:50)<Fobbah>it would be a lot of fun
(09:57:34)<purestrain>unfortunately D does not work on NDS
(09:57:39)<purestrain>neither does it on a gp2x
(09:58:49)<purestrain>and i'm tired of c++ :-/
(10:02:59)<oeb_werk>Is there much of a difference between D and C++?
(10:03:22)<oeb_werk>D was intended as the logicial followup from C right?
(10:03:54)<purestrain>is much more comfortable; like .net for native applications :-)
(10:05:27)<purestrain>and of course the compile times are much faster
(10:11:37)<purestrain>i'm currently having a hard time patching my roguelike... i want to remove the realtime gameloop
(10:11:51)<purestrain>and use a second thread for updating graphics
(10:12:19)<purestrain>and my graphics system has to be patched too to allow multiple tilesizes :-/
(10:35:44)<oeb_werk>Morning joe
(10:36:25)<oeb_werk>purestrain, I am also having a hard time with mine, and I have pretty much nothing done yet =P
(10:36:40)<oeb_werk>An @ running around and a really shitty random town generator
(10:37:41)<oeb_werk>I wonder could a more realistic town be created by using one of those random generators for making trees and the like. Draw a big road through, branch off sub roads, houses are like leaves.
(10:38:10)<oeb_werk>Cities would be similar exept with blocks of houses.
(10:38:24)<oeb_werk>Actually I have a neat idea for a city.
(10:39:00)<oeb_werk>Start with a bunch of squares, as many as you can, each represents a block. Have them pre-generated and just slot them all in
(10:39:15)<oeb_werk>You could have blocks that have sub roads going through them too.
(10:39:25)<oeb_werk>Although it would still be a bit regular. Hmmm
(10:39:33)<purestrain>i would just subdivide the whole map until a certain size of squares and generate roads accross the borders ;-)
(10:39:55)<purestrain>with some random changes
(10:40:49)<oeb_werk>I know alot of cities nowdays are pretty regular, but any historic city tends to be twisty and turney and a fecking mess of one way streets and the like.
(10:41:18)<oeb_werk>Cork in Ireland for example. It's a pain to drive in because alot of the streets are so narrow.
(10:41:22)<purestrain>nobody says that _every_ border has to be a street =D
(10:41:43)<oeb_werk>I'll have to take a toy around with this.
(10:42:21)<joe6pack>morning 
(10:42:24)<joe6pack>or rather
(10:42:26)<joe6pack>noon 
(10:42:48)<purestrain>almost 11am
(10:43:13)<oeb_werk>I don't know what to do next in my project. There is so much I want to figure out. I want to figure out map scrolling, I want to figure out using colours in curses (I'm really new to this =P), and I want to figure out will I keep using a 2d array of structs or change the map to a complete linked list with references for each direction.
(10:43:19)<oeb_werk>It's 9.47 am here =P
(10:43:29)<joe6pack>ante meridiem
(10:43:36)<purestrain>wah, keep a 2d array
(10:43:57)<purestrain>you would waste a lot of resources and processing power if the map is only a linked list
(10:44:06)<joe6pack>oeb_werk: you don't have daylight saving time in ie?
(10:44:13)<oeb_werk>Would I? Never used a linked list before.
(10:44:16)<oeb_werk>I do
(10:44:28)<joe6pack>oh wait
(10:44:29)<oeb_werk>It's 9.47 GMT now
(10:44:34)<joe6pack>yea yea
(10:44:37)<purestrain>i would recommend a hashtable like (x*y*z) for 'sectors' and each sector has 32x32 tiles as a 2d map
(10:44:39)<joe6pack>:|
(10:44:44)<oeb_werk>Clocks went back again a while back.
(10:44:53)<joe6pack>yeah i read it wrong 
(10:45:06)<oeb_werk>A hash table, is that just like an associative array?
(10:45:06)<joe6pack>i'm going to slovenia today 
(10:45:21)<joe6pack>oeb_werk: i think the 2 are the same
(10:45:25)<purestrain>yes, it is
(10:45:28)<oeb_werk>Go easy on me, I am a PHP nerd =P
(10:46:30)<purestrain>just another syntax
(10:49:10)<oeb_werk>I just find that I am confusing myself with the array. Maybe I will just rewrite it make it clearer for myself.
(10:49:24)<oeb_werk>There is only about 100 lines of code written anyway.
(10:49:26)<joe6pack>purestrain: c is most certainly not "just another syntax" for a php programmer :)
(10:49:53)<oeb_werk>Well, the language structures are mostly the same. At least I don't have to learn how to do loops again.
(10:50:27)<joe6pack>oeb_werk: actually i guess the syntax is similar, but the languages are very different 
(10:50:32)<oeb_werk>And I wont keep confusing equality and assignment operators like I used to when I first took a stab at c (7 or 8 years ago)
(10:50:44)<joe6pack>they are just made to look superficially similar i guess
(10:50:54)<oeb_werk>Ohh yes, one thing I was wondering about.
(10:51:07)<oeb_werk>How do I use multiple files for one project in c?
(10:51:17)<joe6pack>you link them
(10:51:18)<oeb_werk>Is it just with the #include?
(10:51:33)<joe6pack> #include for .h files and then you link them
(10:51:46)<oeb_werk>I don't understand what you mean. Google here I come
(10:52:09)<joe6pack>gcc  file1.c file2.c file3.c
(10:52:23)<oeb_werk>Ohh ok, it's just done at compile time?
(10:52:33)<joe6pack>if file1 uses functions from file2 and file2 from  file3
(10:52:52)<oeb_werk>Can file 3 use functions from 1? is it recursive?
(10:52:54)<joe6pack>actually in link time, but from your point of view i guess they are the same :)
(10:53:16)<joe6pack>i think not, but maybe gcc has some smart way of solving that
(10:53:20)<oeb_werk>http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/node35.html  << this looks like it may help me.
(10:53:38)<joe6pack>but i would put the common functions in file4 a link that one to both
(10:54:02)<purestrain>maybe c is a bit different ;-)
(10:54:47)<oeb_werk>I just noticed from looking at other code (powder for example) that there would be a map.cpp, then another file for dealing with creatures, etc etc
(10:55:11)<oeb_werk>Mind you that's c++
(10:55:17)<joe6pack>same
(10:55:27)<joe6pack>(at least in that respect)
(10:55:27)<oeb_werk>Linking is handled the same way?
(10:55:41)<joe6pack>in c & c++? i think so
(10:56:35)<oeb_werk>Ohh ok.
(10:58:00)<oeb_werk>Looking at this code, I should be listing all my functions in my header file that's included by the file that my main() is in.
(10:58:01)<purestrain>did you use oop in php ?
(10:58:51)<purestrain>you just need header files to let each other file know, what functions you defined
(10:59:12)<oeb_werk>I have used OOP in PHP, and in c# (Long ago again)
(10:59:56)<purestrain>so why do you want to code in plain c?
(11:00:57)<oeb_werk>Someone here recomended I start with c and move onto c++ later when I am more comfortable with it.
(11:01:49)<purestrain>but if you are already familiar with the syntax (almost the same in php) and know oop, than its a step backwards, don't you think?
(11:02:46)<oeb_werk>This is my first (real) attempt at a roguelike, most of the code and stuff out there is in c anyway.
(11:03:21)<oeb_werk>I doubt any of the stuff I am doing right now will end up in my final project anyway.
(11:04:07)<purestrain>i don't understand you... either you are already familiar with oop and programming in general, then you should be able to easily translate c into c++
(11:05:51)<purestrain>or you just copy and paste code and did never think about what you are doing.... but then you did never really any programming
(11:06:00)<oeb_werk>PHP oo is limited
(11:06:04)<oeb_werk>especially in PHP4
(11:06:11)<oeb_werk>And that's mostly what I work in.
(11:06:26)<oeb_werk>You really cant do a whole pile more than data objects.
(11:07:45)<oeb_werk>Now, I am familiar with the concepts behind the likes of inheritence, interfaces etc, but most of this stuff is from so long ago it's like it was in another life. I am still making enough newbie c mistakes without having to worry about newbie c++ mistakes.
(11:08:52)<oeb_werk>I don't see why it makes a whole pile of difference at this stage if I use an array of structs or an array of tile classes.
(11:09:42)<oeb_werk>I can see the benifits later on of course, I could have a map interface and implementations for a town, a cave, a crypt etc, I just think I will cross this when I come to it.
(11:10:00)<purestrain>do what you want ;-)
(11:10:26)<oeb_werk>At present I am more worried about getting my head wrapped around handling things like movement, curses, gameloops and the like.
(11:10:45)<oeb_werk>All this stuff is not relevant in a PHP coders day to day life.
(11:11:02)<purestrain>while (game_is_running) { do_game_updates; } <- thats a game loop
(11:11:27)<oeb_werk>I know, I have got that far =P
(11:11:58)<oeb_werk>I don't need what c++ adds to the language at this stage.
(11:13:21)<purestrain>of course you don't...
(11:15:49)<purestrain>i thought you didn't want to do a step backwards. i'll find something like this http://rafb.net/p/psln8E34.html much more elegant
(11:17:50)<purestrain>but just do what you want, it's not my game ;-)
(11:18:28)<oeb_werk>It's nowhere near a game. And c is enough of a step forwards from PHP
(11:18:58)<purestrain>not if you used ood in php
(11:19:36)<oeb_werk>oo in PHP4 is severly limited
(11:19:51)<purestrain>it has every basic concept, as far i can remember
(11:19:53)<oeb_werk>Like I said, data objects is really about as much as you can do.
(11:19:57)<oeb_werk>PHP5 does
(11:20:09)<oeb_werk>Most developers still use PHP4 though
(11:20:26)<purestrain>and i remember doing real ood in php4
(11:21:33)<oeb_werk>You can have classes containing a bunch of references, there is inheritence and constructers
(11:21:43)<oeb_werk>s/references/methods/
(11:22:18)<purestrain>what else magic do you need? :-)
(11:23:11)<oeb_werk>There is lot's more to oo than what php4 offers.
(11:23:28)<Fobbah>rofl http://www.sharenator.com/vid/347/
(11:23:50)<purestrain>c++ does not offer much more
(11:24:52)<purestrain>the only problem existed (afaik) that in php4 you can't extend from multiple classes/interfaces
(11:25:33)<oeb_werk>Cant declare methods as public etc
(11:25:39)<oeb_werk>no interfaces
(11:26:04)<purestrain>syntactic sugar... you event don't have interfaces in cpp
(11:26:18)<oeb_werk>Don't you? I don't know these things =P
(11:26:32)<oeb_werk>All I know is that c++ is OO and c is not.
(11:26:39)<purestrain>just abstract classes, which you _could_ do in php4 with some self discipline
(11:42:06)<joe6pack>purestrain: will you come to the berlin rgrd meeting in september?
(11:42:13)<joe6pack>(if it really does take place)
(11:42:52)<purestrain>i don't think so, since i'm not actually a hardcore roguelike developer ;-)
(11:43:18)<joe6pack>come on...
(11:43:29)<oeb_werk>Are you expecting many?
(11:43:29)<joe6pack>where in germany are you anyway?
(11:43:33)<joe6pack>oeb_werk: no
(11:43:41)<joe6pack>maybe a 3-4 tops
(11:43:48)<joe6pack>s/a /
(11:43:51)<purestrain>near dÔøΩsseldorf; right on the opposite side of germany
(11:44:22)<joe6pack>well i am in vienna, so you can't be much further away than i am
(11:45:08)<purestrain>okay, but i think you are quite more involved with roguelikes then i am
(11:45:25)<joe6pack>i only ever  released one game...
(11:45:27)<purestrain>beside the fact i would like to see you guys and train my english skills =D
(11:45:43)<joe6pack>and it's not a competition 
(11:45:59)<purestrain>yeah, just a meeting i think... with beer i hope =D
(11:46:08)<joe6pack>but of course
(11:46:36)<joe6pack>rotateme will come most probably, maybe the_ru
(11:47:13)<joe6pack>a couple of the other scandinavians/poles and we'll have a nice bunch 
(11:47:43)<joe6pack>i guess all the rest will have to travel from further afield 
(11:47:55)<joe6pack>but berlin has cheap connections to all of europe, at the very least
(11:48:06)<joe6pack>flights, that is
(11:48:49)<purestrain>yeah; i hope nobody will get lots there :P
(11:50:00)<purestrain>i currently talked to my girlfried; since she has some 'kinswoman'?? 'relative'?? there, she would like to travel to berlin
(11:50:28)<joe6pack>it should be an interesting city anyway 
(11:52:45)<oeb_werk>That snitzel (How do you spell it?) stuff you get in germany rocks.
(11:52:56)<oeb_werk>A german friend made it for me a few times.
(11:52:56)<joe6pack>schnitzel 
(11:52:57)<joe6pack>also
(11:53:03)<joe6pack>blasphemy!!!
(11:53:08)<joe6pack>schnitzel is austrian!
(11:53:29)<joe6pack>not german!
(11:53:37)<oeb_werk>Is it? I dunno, I a mate went to college in germany for a while and he was always on about it. I just assumed it came from there.
(11:54:17)<purestrain>um? isn't schnitzel known everywhere ?
(11:54:20)<oeb_werk>But seriously, what a great idea. Beat the crap out of some meat with a hammer and put some breadcrumbs on it (May be simplified =D). Yum
(11:54:30)<oeb_werk>No, you dont see it in Ireland
(11:54:52)<oeb_werk>Well, you can get breaded chicken fillets, which I guess is kinda like schnitzel.
(11:56:09)<joe6pack>i think the basic idea is quite common 
(11:56:43)<joe6pack>you can find something similar even in arab countries & some parts of india
(11:58:07)<joe6pack>oeb_werk: so are you comming as well? i'm sure we can hook you up with some schnitzel upon landing 
(12:01:21)<purestrain>i've signed myself in for germany
(12:01:30)<purestrain>ah, berlin
(12:05:12)<oeb_werk>joe, nahh mate
(12:05:41)<oeb_werk>I'll get some coding done first =P
(12:07:02)<joe6pack>you have until October though ;)
(12:07:47)<oeb_werk>I'm lazy and I have a 2 year old.
(12:08:02)<purestrain>how is it meant to be done? just sitting in a pub? overnight?
(12:08:03)<joe6pack>ok...
(12:08:12)<joe6pack>purestrain: i have no idea
(12:08:19)<oeb_werk>I can't see myself having a whole pile done =P I am starting a new job in a couple of weeks. I'll see how that goes.
(12:08:27)<joe6pack>the details have not been ironed out 
(12:08:37)<joe6pack>good luck
(12:08:57)<joe6pack>i guess a month or so before the date we can think things through
(12:09:06)<oeb_werk>It's not like I can't decide to go and book a couple of weeks before hand, Berlin is a big place, I can't imagine it's too difficult to get accomidation, and it's real easy to get there from Ireland.
(12:09:22)<joe6pack>yes
(12:09:35)<oeb_werk>Will it be on a weekend?
(12:09:41)<joe6pack>that was part of the reason, it's easy to get there from most places in europe
(12:10:04)<joe6pack>probably, there's no date set yet. but that would make things easier for a lot of people
(12:10:36)<joe6pack>so far there are 2 votes for sep and 2 for oct
(12:11:02)<joe6pack>os i guess after it's decided a more accurate date may be chosen
(12:11:22)<oeb_werk>And it's not like I would need to buy a bunch of currency or anything I guess.
(12:15:04)<oeb_werk>Morning jraregris
(12:24:43)<joe6pack>are there any holidays in September or October?
(12:24:58)<joe6pack>i think October must have a couple
(12:25:57)<oeb_werk>27th of october is a holiday in Ireland this year
(12:27:34)<joe6pack>some catholic thing?
(12:28:01)<joe6pack>if it is than it's probably a holiday in austria & poland as well
(12:28:14)<joe6pack>s/than/then
(12:28:49)<jraregris>morning :)
(12:29:53)<oeb_werk>joe6pack, nahhh, October Holiday, it's just a bank holiday. Last Monday in October.
(01:06:57)<purestrain>berlin is quite clear for the meeting, we should focus on a specific date now
(01:08:58)<oeb_werk>purestrain, is there a bank holiday at the end of October in Germany?
(01:09:41)<oeb_werk>Hmm, no it's not. 3rd and 31st
(01:38:16)<oeb_werk>So tired today for some reason =(

(05:25:49)<oeb_werk>RotateMe, with lots of portals?
(05:27:36)<oeb_werk>Did you ever read Ringworld by Niven? At somestage in the book Philip Wu is on a pupeteers planet, and he describes stepping disks located at corners. You walk into one an jump straight to the next one enabling you to travel vast distances with minimal effort (Just the walk between the two disks). It made me think of something like that.
(08:10:04)<purestrain>drod has a great graphics style

(09:21:30)<Kadwiell>Looks pretty nice, but perhaps a few different vegetation tiles would be good, the patterns look a bit too visible
(09:22:47)<Kadwiell>Also, there seems to be some weirdness going on the top, three tiles from the left?
(09:36:35)<purestrain>weirdness?
(09:37:02)<purestrain>there is a void putc(char c)

(10:55:13)<the_ru>I wonder what it is we're supposed to be voting for
(11:00:50)<the_ru>I suppose there's no concrete proposal for a place and date
(11:14:50)<jraregris>you said you'd be able to host in sweden?
(11:27:49)<the_ru>probably
(11:27:55)<the_ru>but very few seem to be willing to travel this far
(11:29:17)<jraregris>it's the closest among the alternatives for my part
(11:29:39)<the_ru>are you sure?
(11:29:55)<the_ru>closest isn't always fastest or cheapest
(11:30:13)<the_ru>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiruna
(11:30:20)<jraregris>I'm in Oslo
(11:31:02)<the_ru>then it's two hops by air or a day by train
(11:31:14)<the_ru>at least a day
(11:32:30)<the_ru>or ~2000 km to drive
(11:32:38)<the_ru>maybe slightly less
(11:32:48)<the_ru>1700 perhaps
(11:33:29)<jraregris>haha
(11:33:33)<jraregris>the joke's on me
(11:34:52)<the_ru>but anyway, before we start voting on dates and locations, I'm wondering - are there actually any hosts?
(11:35:44)<the_ru>someone has to pick up the ball for this to happen
(11:36:13)<the_ru>i.e. decide and announce a date and place, *then* see how many are interested
(11:37:19)<the_ru>very few will be able to come anyway, so just waiting for people to make up their minds won't lead to anything

(11:49:25)<the_ru>feels like europe is the only realistic alternative
+++ The date has changed: 2008/05/23 +++
(08:08:36)<purestrain>Good morning
(08:58:07)<the_ru>hi
(08:58:10)<the_ru>and bye
(09:51:50)<oeb_werk>Morning folks
(09:52:05)<purestrain>morning
(10:14:06)<greg>hi everybody
(10:14:11)<purestrain>hi
(10:29:44)<purestrain>wohow... GUI/Graphics are now running in a second thread \o/
(10:31:29)<greg>^^
(10:31:48)<greg>you are writing a roguelike ? 
(10:31:55)<purestrain>i am
(10:32:39)<greg>ok, do you have some algo to build rivers randomly
(10:32:55)<purestrain>no, i dont need rivers
(10:33:25)<greg>i am in trouble with river making since one week :'( i still have'nt finnd a solution
(10:33:35)<greg>ok ^^
(10:34:30)<purestrain>o_O isn't making a river just like: start from a high point and go down hills ?
(10:36:38)<greg>hum not really, if you do that you will have line, not rivers :) 
(10:37:34)<purestrain>use some randomization... but aren't rivers mostly flowing down elevations?
(10:37:36)<greg>i have tried a mix between A* and a percolation program but it is really slow and unefficent : all the river are near the coast
(10:38:01)<greg>yes  ^^ 
(10:38:40)<oeb_werk>Holy crap, Robson's town generator is a little more complete than mine =/
(10:38:46)<purestrain>so what is the point? o_O you have a heightmap, you have a source, just flow down / stay on level with some randomization
(10:39:01)<oeb_werk>Mine: 4o3.net/map.php His: http://iceyboard.no-ip.org/dg/
(10:40:38)<greg>http://img519.imageshack.us/my.php?image=riviererx6.jpg 
(10:40:52)<purestrain>robsons one is always centered around a square...
(10:41:51)<greg>yep, my problems are on the speed of the algo and on the making of in land river 
(10:42:35)<greg>a sea search algo + A star on a 5000*5000 map is really slow, so i am looking on other solutions to do it
(10:43:40)<Kadwiell>Rivers don't actually "search for the sea", it's probably better to use some variation on "flow down slopes"
(10:43:44)<purestrain>i had a (for my resons) nice one world generator on c64; but i've lost the floppy dics
(10:44:05)<Kadwiell>If you had a river originating at the bottom of a valley, wouldn't searching for the sea make it flow upwards?
(10:44:23)<purestrain>slopes... thats the term i needed :-)
(10:44:51)<oeb_werk>greg, reverse it. Start at the sea and use a* to find a hill maybe.
(10:45:05)<purestrain>hmmm
(10:45:30)<greg>hum interresting way of thinking ^^
(10:45:38)<oeb_werk>Same thing, and less computations
(10:45:45)<oeb_werk>Less likely to trap itself
(10:45:54)<purestrain>i don't see the problem with a random spot and flow down slopes... so you can create small lakes too
(10:46:49)<oeb_werk>A river will almost always go to the sea eventually.
(10:47:02)<oeb_werk>You can't just keep on dumping water into a lake forever.
(10:47:47)<oeb_werk>What you could do, is as you are building it back from the sea, allow it to pass through depressions if it has to and just turn them into lakes.
(10:48:48)<greg>hum i first wanted to build lakes after rivers to have a limited amount of lakes
(10:49:07)<purestrain>but you already have lakes
(10:49:52)<purestrain>did you generate a heightmap and fill the surroundings with water up to a certain level ?
(10:50:04)<greg>:) yes
(10:50:17)<greg>i have small area of water sometimes
(10:51:08)<Kadwiell>oeb_werk: That's a great idea.. basically the same as the simulationist one(starting "first, create an object for every water molecule.."), but with _way_ less computations
(10:53:52)<greg><oeb_werk> your method seems to be light in computes and quite easy
(10:54:04)<greg>^^ i try it
(10:54:10)<greg>thanks a lot
(11:10:37)<oeb_werk>Look at me, I can invent algos while probably being unable to implement them =P I am dreading needing to implement pathfinding.
(11:11:22)<oeb_werk>I'm gonna try and improve my town generator tonight, which means I will need to develop a scrolling screen (Where the map is bigger than the view port. I have no idea where to even start.
(11:12:07)<purestrain>uh
(11:12:39)<purestrain>how about starting with some sort of camera class? :-)
(11:13:35)<oeb_werk>I know, I'm just not feeling very logicial at the moment.
(11:14:23)<oeb_werk>I was thinking about what you were saying yesterday, and I agree with you. It's really silly not to be using c++ for this. I would probably find it easier to think about this in an OO way anyway.
(11:14:42)<purestrain>\o/
(11:14:56)<oeb_werk>I am used to objects, data structures (Even though they are the same as a data object) are new and strange to me =P
(11:16:55)<oeb_werk>I think PHP4 has unfairly biased me agains OOP.
(11:17:33)<oeb_werk>In alot of large scale PHP4 applications OOP was suicide. Procedural code was always faster and less system intensive.
(11:18:13)<purestrain>maybe you find this code usefull http://retroforge.de/~md/index.php/archives/24
(11:19:27)<oeb_werk>neat, emailed home thanks.
(11:19:43)<greg><oeb_werk> you need a scroll map code ? 
(11:19:43)<purestrain>http://rafb.net/p/dMucdw44.html <- this is my world-renderer; not quite big but perhaps it can serve as a starting point
(11:20:07)<greg>i have one in  C++ if you want
(11:20:37)<purestrain>greg, poste it; i would like to take a peek to
(11:20:41)<purestrain>perhaps i get some new ideas
(11:20:44)<oeb_werk>greg, for local maps? I would appreciate it cheers. Just so I can see how it's done
(11:21:31)<oeb_werk>I am emailing all this stuff home so I can read them tonight.
(11:21:32)<greg><oeb_werk> ok i you want all the source code i have also made a script engine and some classes on actors ...
(11:21:53)<greg>i upload it on megaupload
(11:21:58)<purestrain>yeah
(11:21:58)<oeb_werk>Friday is coding night, I have my kid and he goes to bed at 8. So I have to stay in =P
(11:22:11)<oeb_werk>Fantastic, I'm sure it will be a great help.
(11:23:15)<oeb_werk>purestrain, is rafb.net your site?
(11:23:24)<purestrain>no
(11:23:43)<oeb_werk>I might knock together a pastebin specificially for roguelike developers
(11:24:10)<purestrain>huh? and what are the benefits ?
(11:24:16)<oeb_werk>Will keep the stuff relevant to people looking for ideas.
(11:24:40)<oeb_werk>For example if I am trying to figure out a dungeon creator, I can see other peoples takes on it.
(11:24:48)<oeb_werk>Avoid encountering the same problems.
(11:25:00)<oeb_werk>If needs be articles can be flagged as private too.
(11:25:10)<purestrain>i would just post it at roguebasin
(11:25:51)<oeb_werk>I could give the pastebin to roguebasin. Simple enough to hack up something like that with synthax highlighting and the like with geshi
(11:28:36)<greg>ok guys here it is : http://www.megaupload.com/?d=G8264EG5
(11:29:09)<greg>so : little explanations
(11:29:26)<greg>the functions wich interrest you are in gameengine.cpp
(11:29:57)<greg>these are three:
(11:30:59)<greg>calcul_plr_to_cam_dist()
(11:31:37)<greg>which place the camera centered on the player, it use the player location and the map size to do it
(11:32:02)<greg>move_cam() which move the camera with the player
(11:32:15)<purestrain>65kb file... did you ever think about splitting your god class into several smaller ones?
(11:32:53)<greg>limit_cam() to check the cam position and to limit the cam in the map
(11:33:08)<greg>and finaly draw_map() wich draw the map
(11:33:18)<greg><purestrain> well no :s
(11:35:33)<purestrain>just for interest... what was the reason not to use an existing script interpreter ?
(11:36:08)<greg>because this project was for school
(11:36:10)<oeb_werk>I'm sure this will be a great help. Thanks greg.
(11:36:32)<greg>it was interresting to try to build a script engine
(11:36:41)<greg>no problem ;)
(11:37:31)<greg>to buil camera or scrolling just use the 4 function, it will work perfectly
(11:38:45)<oeb_werk>purestrain, looking at your blog atm, I like the map generator output on Mar 10 2008. Realistic looking for a large modern complex.
(11:39:44)<purestrain>uh, i think realistic would be more squared =D
(11:41:13)<oeb_werk>I still think it looks great
(11:42:59)<purestrain>yes, i like it too, but in reality, who would work in such a complex? i'll want to create a better one, i little bit more symmetric
(11:44:57)<purestrain>and with multiple levels in mind... i've the advantage of _not_ creating a gigantic overworld map since its only mission based
(11:45:41)<purestrain>and i need no streaming then !! \o/
(11:46:19)<oeb_werk>purestrain, ever played fallout two?
(11:46:37)<purestrain>i own it; but not played much more then some hours
(11:46:53)<oeb_werk>The way the complexes are presented in the later levels of that are quite nice
(11:47:07)<purestrain>but they are not randomized, aren't they?
(11:47:07)<oeb_werk>Underground complexes that reflect overworld features.
(11:47:10)<oeb_werk>No
(11:47:15)<oeb_werk>But they could be
(11:48:01)<oeb_werk>Basicially you draw a number of features on your map. Lets say a small airfield, a baracks and a lab. They can be quite far apart.
(11:48:20)<oeb_werk>Underneath each one you generate a small tunnel complex, and connect the complexes.
(11:48:43)<oeb_werk>The complex can be multi-layer/depth
(11:49:19)<oeb_werk>The above areas can also be disguised. For example there may be a lab or military baracks under a town.
(11:49:25)<greg>http://www.drachenzahn.de/city_map_generator/city_maps.html -> quite interesting in term of random city generation ^^ 
(11:50:05)<oeb_werk>Looks nice
(11:50:34)<oeb_werk>I am still wondering how complex I am actually going to make this game.
(11:50:44)<oeb_werk>I still need to work out alot of stuff on paper.
(11:53:26)<oeb_werk>Morning syntax_tn
(11:57:31)<purestrain>quite impressive the generator
(12:03:51)<oeb_werk>Been thinking about your complex generator. You could make it more realistic maybe with larger rooms. For example in any modern complex, most of the rooms would be much much larger. Labs, cube farms etc.
(12:04:24)<oeb_werk>You could also make the map smaller, and multi story.
(12:04:53)<purestrain>yeah; right. but there was no time left for the 7drl; the whole generator at that stage took me several hours
(12:06:38)<oeb_werk>I'm sure you will find another use for it =)
(12:06:57)<purestrain>my goal is to create a generator for building something like a colony from the aliens movie
(12:08:06)<oeb_werk>I am pondering the idea of starting a blog. That way I can log my experience from starting at ground 0 to hopefully a finished product. There are lots of blogs out there, but most of them are run by people on their second or third game.
(12:08:25)<oeb_werk>Maybe it might help another roguelike player who decides he wants to make his own.
(12:09:04)<oeb_werk>Also, have you played AliensRL? That has decent complex maps.
(12:10:07)<purestrain>yes, i've played it. but i think the maps are a bit inferior, since they are always based around a cross road
(12:10:27)<purestrain>but aliens-rl took me again into roguelike playing and development =D
(12:11:12)<oeb_werk>What about looking at real life plans for complex
(12:11:55)<oeb_werk>I cant recall ever seeing a really large enclosed one actually. Most are a number of connected buildings.
(12:12:10)<purestrain>dito
(12:12:47)<purestrain>thats my goal: creating a map consisting of multiple installation in a usefull sense
(12:13:29)<purestrain>and every installation will mainly consists of severl main corridors connected to the outside
(12:14:47)<oeb_werk>Could be really interesting to implement. For example buildings would not all have the same number of floors. There could be skyways (The elevated corridors that connect buildings)
(12:15:28)<oeb_werk>Due to the nature of modern building practices there would need to be proper stairwells and elevators. Not like the way stairs are handled in fantasy games.
(12:16:15)<purestrain>problems which i dont want to face currently =D
(12:18:43)<oeb_werk>Hmm, I think I'll have a think about that tonight.
(12:19:02)<oeb_werk>I am still trying to come up with ways to keep my game idea interesting
(12:19:40)<oeb_werk>I figure the way it is at the moment it would be fun for a few levels.
(12:19:48)<oeb_werk>(The concept that is)
(12:21:06)<purestrain>my most current problem is either using opengl or just sdl
(12:21:18)<greg[miam_time]>use allegro
(12:21:26)<purestrain>o_O
(12:21:30)<greg[miam_time]>it is really easy to use ;) 
(12:21:49)<greg[miam_time]>what ? :p 
(12:21:56)<purestrain>uh; i only need a idea about using 3d or just 2d
(12:22:10)<purestrain>everything else is already implemented
(12:22:40)<greg[miam_time]>well i think 2d will be enough hard to do ^^ especially if you use tiles and animations
(12:23:05)<purestrain>thats no problem since everything is done...
(12:23:21)<purestrain>but as i think about stairways, 3d would be much more better to handle for the user
(12:24:40)<greg[miam_time]>hum ... you may also use isometric 3d like fallout 2 ;) 
(12:25:16)<greg[miam_time]>it is between 2d and 3d
(12:26:15)<greg[miam_time]>3d is awesome for players but quite hard to implement 
(12:28:02)<Kadwiell>I like tiles better, if they're sufficiently well drawn
(12:28:21)<Kadwiell>Unless the gameplay demands 3d because you have an actual third dimension, of course
(12:29:21)<purestrain>but stairways are a 3rd dimension
(12:29:22)<oeb_werk>That's a nice idea, 2.5d
(12:30:13)<oeb_werk>Stairways are a 3rd dimension, but not in the normal sense. Unless you want people to be standing half way up the stairs while fighting it's irrelivent.
(12:30:23)<oeb_werk>I really can't spell =/
(12:33:02)<Kadwiell>I think allowing action "halfway up the stairs" would be nice, if it wasn't bound to become horribly confusing in a tiled/ascii system
(12:33:22)<oeb_werk>Well is there really a need for it?
(12:33:22)<Kadwiell>If someone's making an actual 3D roguelike they should include that :)
(12:33:40)<oeb_werk>It can be acomplished far easier by just making a climb action take two turns
(12:33:49)<Kadwiell>Perhaps not.. but sometimes the stairs are of tactical relevance when they shouldn't really be
(12:33:53)<oeb_werk>As in you start the climb, get another turn, then go up.
(12:34:49)<oeb_werk>That could make stairs leathal to seasoned roguelike players though.
(12:34:49)<Kadwiell>Hmm, I meant more detailed; the stairs aren't "portals" at all, they just take you to a different part of the map in the height dimension, like every other tile does in the x/y dimensions
(12:35:07)<Kadwiell>It would be confusing because there wouldn't be a well-defined 2D "level"
(12:35:12)<oeb_werk>Hmmm, whatcha call that game, firestorm did something like that.
(12:35:34)<oeb_werk>As in you could shoot holes in the floor and drop grenades down on the next level
(12:35:45)<oeb_werk>Flying monsters could also fly up the hole.
(12:35:57)<Kadwiell>Pretty much every FPS does it, I guess.. but they don't have procedurally generated dungeons for levels
(12:36:13)<Kadwiell>Nice
(12:36:14)<oeb_werk>Jaunt Trooper, that's what it's called
(12:36:19)<oeb_werk>It's a roguelike
(12:38:03)<purestrain>well
(12:38:38)<purestrain>i could draw top-down, but that would be irritating...
(12:38:44)<purestrain>isometric would be horrible to draw for me :-)
(12:38:58)<purestrain>3d would be much easier, since i only have to draw textures for walls
(12:39:37)<purestrain>monsters and items would simply become some sort of rounded 'gamepiece' with a texture on top
(12:40:00)<Kadwiell>Ah, hmm, that might work
(12:40:33)<oeb_werk>Isometric is not so bad. Draw it in a 3d program and rotate it.
(12:40:48)<Kadwiell>Might look a bit weird though, 3D for me mentally implies a non-symbolic view
(12:41:43)<Kadwiell>I think there's a bit more pixel-precision involved in good tilemaking
(12:42:00)<Kadwiell>(But I'm horrible at graphics, so I wouldn't really know)
(12:42:22)<oeb_werk>My younger brother is a graphic designer. I am trying to talk him into doing some tiles for me.
(12:45:42)<purestrain>hmm... i think that is the way to go.... using opengl; tilebased mechanics with 'real drawn walls' and just game pieces with textures for monster/item representation
(12:46:37)<purestrain>but it would require far more processing power
(12:46:57)<oeb_werk>hmm, have you guys seen these? http://www.rpg-palace.com/downloads/details.php?id=174 
(12:47:14)<oeb_werk>There seems to be alot of tiles on the site (under chipsets on the left)
(12:52:55)<purestrain>... i'll stick to 2d/sdl... remembering my last tries of 3d got me tired again
(12:54:31)<oeb_werk>I'm just gonna use curses for the moment. I can always change it later if 
(12:54:37)<oeb_werk>+I need to I guess
(12:54:51)<oeb_werk>Damn enter key being just above shift =P
(01:32:51)<oeb_werk>Ho hum, I can't wait to finish up this job. It's getting really really obscure here. Micromanagement is so much fun.
(01:33:25)<oeb_werk>I got asked by one of the new managers here "How long does it take to make a website" I said "What kinda website" he goes "Any kind of website" =/
(01:36:28)<jomiolto>You should have countered with something like "how long does it take to make a building?" :)
(01:43:35)<oeb_werk>I asked him how long was a piece of string
(01:45:36)<jomiolto>hah :)
(02:43:54)<oeb_werk>hmph, to blog or not to blog
(02:49:40)<the_ru>do you have anything to blog about?
(02:49:57)<the_ru>i.e. something that anyone except yourself would care to read
(02:51:08)<oeb_werk>Well, I am starting from scratch as a roguelike developer.
(02:51:22)<oeb_werk>Using an unfamiliar language and dealing with unfamiliar topics
(02:52:20)<the_ru>that still doesn't answer the question
(02:52:55)<oeb_werk>Well it does really. I think it could potentially be a useful resource for anyone else going down the same road.
(02:53:12)<oeb_werk>Maybe not right now, but at some stage later.
(02:53:31)<the_ru>perhaps there are better ways to document it than in a blog
(02:53:52)<oeb_werk>I'm going to have to figure out pretty much everything that's needed for a roguelike.
(02:54:15)<oeb_werk>Hell, the last day I had to find out how to get code:blocks, gcc and pdcurses set up correctly.
(02:54:29)<oeb_werk>It's not obvious your first time round.
(02:54:53)<the_ru>no, it's not
(02:55:12)<the_ru>personally I would find a small collection of how-to documents more useful than a blog
(02:55:35)<oeb_werk>Maybe, but a blog has, for lack of a better word a timeline.
(02:55:41)<oeb_werk>A clear line of progress
(02:56:12)<oeb_werk>I would be using it more as a progress diary than a website full of articles.
(02:56:35)<the_ru>yes, of course
(02:56:41)<the_ru>you can do whatever you want :-)
(02:57:17)<the_ru>or you could combine the two - have a progress blog, then later go through and gather the really useful bits into their own documents
(02:57:25)<oeb_werk>That's true.
(02:57:52)<oeb_werk>I often might only do a bit of code over two evenings, a howto from the start would be a bit disjointed
(02:59:05)<the_ru>it's also a matter of how you present it
(02:59:14)<the_ru>a "blog" could be just a text file
(02:59:36)<the_ru>I find the layout of most major blog sites very hard to understand
(02:59:51)<oeb_werk>In what way if you dont mind me asking?
(03:00:18)<oeb_werk>I could just as easilly write scripts for my own blog.
(03:01:54)<the_ru>http://swartz.typepad.com/
(03:01:57)<the_ru>for example
(03:02:01)<the_ru>a political blog
(03:02:26)<the_ru>"recent comments" - why does this need to be on the front page?
(03:03:08)<the_ru>lots of stuff on the sides that isn't really needed
(03:03:11)<oeb_werk>I agree with you there.
(03:03:29)<oeb_werk>A blog I currently never update: http://magicireland.com
(03:03:35)<oeb_werk>Do you find that clearer?
(03:03:37)<the_ru>I find blogs very hard to search since everything is ordered chronologically
(03:04:33)<the_ru>it's a bit easier to read but feels very much like a standard template :-)
(03:05:40)<oeb_werk>It is a standard template
(03:05:49)<the_ru>but I guess in the end it depends on what you want to achieve with your writing
(03:06:09)<the_ru>just writing stuff down is a great way to clear your head and make room for new ideas and solutions
(03:08:17)<the_ru>but when I see a post in RGRD that goes like "follow my blog to get the latest news", I just think "YAWN, just code, then bring interesting questions here"
(03:09:02)<the_ru>as if I would be interested in reading a blog where someone posts stuff like "development has been a bit slow lately since I took a dump and had to go to the hospital"
(03:09:02)<oeb_werk>I agree with you there.
(03:10:26)<the_ru>OTOH, posting every little thought to the newsgroup wouldn't be appreciated
(03:10:47)<the_ru>that's why I'm glad this place exists
(03:10:57)<oeb_werk>That being said, I do like to read the various development blogs because it's great for ideas.
(03:11:30)<oeb_werk>For example you can follow along with a couple of different ways of lets say building a dungeon.
(03:12:10)<the_ru>they're often just ideas though :-/
(03:12:33)<oeb_werk>There is nothing wrong with that.
(03:12:51)<oeb_werk>Seeing how other people do things can help you refine your thoughts.
(03:13:01)<the_ru>well, that's the problem
(03:13:06)<the_ru>having idea isn't doing
(03:13:25)<oeb_werk>Well that's up to the developer.
(03:17:22)<the_ru>for RL development there's a huge gap between ideas and realistic ideas
(03:17:44)<the_ru>I don't mind people discussing vaporware, but I know my own limitations
(03:20:36)<oeb_werk>That's true
(03:21:04)<oeb_werk>I have my first piece of vaporware in a long time on the go at the minute
(03:21:33)<oeb_werk>Step 1: Learn to code Step 2: ???? Step 3: Release 'Angel of Death'
(03:32:01)<the_ru>the title sounds promising at least
(03:34:10)<the_ru>hm
(03:34:17)<the_ru>seems like my GF got a job
(03:34:19)<the_ru>finally
(03:50:56)<the_ru>who was it that imagined my dungeon as a pyramid?
(04:07:15)<the_ru>'lo deveah
(04:13:06)<oeb_werk>the_ru, I came up with what I think is a pretty cool concept, it's just the whole implementation thing is giving me greif at the moment =P
(04:50:04)<deveah>hi the_ru
(04:51:30)<jraregris>tellus!
(04:52:22)<purestrain>arrr
(04:52:57)<purestrain>hay fever... i hate it
(04:53:08)<purestrain>had to abort my ride after 10kilometres
(04:59:07)<the_ru>what were you riding?
(04:59:11)<the_ru>a rollercoaster?
(04:59:19)<purestrain>a bike
(05:44:11)<deveah>lolcat attack!1!!!!11111
(06:48:33)<oeb>hmmm, these tiles are nice
(06:58:23)<deveah>TES Morrowind FTW!
(07:03:45)<the_ru>what do you mean
(07:03:51)<the_ru>what is this FTW you speak of
(07:04:00)<the_ru>WTF I know
(07:04:41)<the_ru>and Morrowind isn't that great IMO :-/
(07:06:35)<Glowie>For the win
(07:07:29)<the_ru>I know the acronym, but I don't get what people mean when the use it
(07:07:56)<the_ru>what is the thing in question supposed to win?
(07:08:46)<Glowie>http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ftw
(07:26:14)<jraregris>oeb: what tiles?
(08:08:33)<deveah>it's "For TEH win"
(08:08:44)<deveah>TEH has a significant importance
(08:08:50)<deveah>and Oblivion is more FTW
(08:17:26)<the_ru>what's so great about Morrowind?
(08:17:33)<the_ru>I found it very generic
(08:17:42)<the_ru>over half of island is just a wasteland
(08:19:34)<the_ru>heh
(08:19:42)<the_ru>yet another questionable keybinding
(08:19:50)<the_ru>shift+enter gives $
(08:22:05)<deveah>in Morrowind?
(08:23:36)<the_ru>no, in the real world
(08:30:33)<the_ru>what is the proper way to check if a specific array index exists?
(08:30:36)<the_ru>isset()?
(08:35:09)<Glowie>Access it and check if it crashes \o/
(08:50:27)<deveah>i have a question
(08:51:03)<deveah>what's the simplest algorithm to generate small rooms connected with small cooridors?
(08:53:21)<Glowie>Starting with a screen full of wall and creating the first room in a random place and start loop: 1. pick a suitable tile. 2. create random corridors, as many as you like. 3. create a room. Go to the beginning and loop through. Also add an overlapping check to kill unsuitable corridors and rooms at some point
(08:54:02)<oeb>jraregris, the ones at http://www.rpg-palace.com
(08:54:41)<oeb>what about randomly placing the rooms and use pathfinding to connect them?
(08:54:50)<oeb>Flooding them until they are all connected.
(08:54:52)<Glowie>Not the simplest way
(08:55:06)<Glowie>But doable
(08:55:42)<oeb>With your option do you just stick a room at the end of the corridors?
(08:55:50)<Glowie>Yep
(08:56:14)<Glowie>Doors aren't hard to add either if needed
(08:57:13)<oeb>I guess not
(08:57:24)<oeb>That sounds quick and dirty. I might steal it =P
(08:57:42)<deveah>how about fixed 5x5 tiles that connected make a dungeon?
(08:57:46)<Glowie>I use this approach as the backbone for 3 of my 4 generators :P
(08:57:59)<deveah>[ ] [|] [-]
(08:58:10)<Glowie>5x5 tiles?
(08:58:18)<deveah>yep
(08:58:29)<Glowie>Graphical?
(08:58:37)<deveah>no, 
(08:58:47)<Glowie>Hmm
(08:59:00)<deveah>"tile", meaning a binary 1 and 0 5x5 text simbolising wall or space
(08:59:12)<the_ru>Glowie: the problem with PHP is that it usually won't :-/
(08:59:12)<oeb>That might be too overly regular
(08:59:19)<the_ru>perhaps I should rewrite this in C
(08:59:22)<Glowie>Can't you divide it into tiles after generation :P
(08:59:24)<the_ru>it would be much more robust
(08:59:35)<the_ru>but I'm almost done now
(08:59:44)<oeb>the ru, if $arrayname[index]
(09:00:06)<oeb>anything empty returns false
(09:00:10)<the_ru>a-ha
(09:00:21)<Glowie>oeb, using the same backbone is too regular?
(09:00:36)<the_ru>what happens if I assign it first, then check the assigned variable?
(09:00:36)<oeb>the 3 tiles idea
(09:00:41)<the_ru>will that also be empty?
(09:00:56)<oeb>if($varname) passes on anything non-null
(09:01:06)<oeb>it will only return false if you assign it 0
(09:01:37)<the_ru>ok
(09:01:40)<Glowie>3 tiles? o_O
(09:01:54)<oeb>if you will be assigning 0s use array_key_exists
(09:01:56)<the_ru>I'm not very comfortable with such a loose language as this
(09:02:00)<oeb>Glowie, deveah's solution
(09:02:05)<Glowie>Oh
(09:02:11)<Glowie>Riiight
(09:02:23)<the_ru>well, it's a 0 from a GET
(09:02:31)<the_ru>will it be a string or an integer?
(09:02:41)<oeb>either, depends what you do with it
(09:02:50)<the_ru>use it as array index
(09:02:59)<the_ru>AFAIK 0 is very different from "0"
(09:03:01)<oeb>It does not matter
(09:03:20)<oeb>In php $var['0'] is pretty much the same as $var[0]
(09:03:32)<oeb>If it's a number it will treat it as numeric
(09:03:48)<oeb>Loosly typed, anything can be anything
(09:03:57)<oeb>If you want to force it to be a number just do
(09:04:12)<oeb>$getvar = intval($_GET['varname']);
(09:04:33)<oeb>gotta put the kid to bed, back in ten
(09:08:40)<oeb>ok, he went to sleep way to quick. I think he is up to something.
(09:08:50)<the_ru>how old is he?
(09:10:15)<oeb>2 next month
(09:10:38)<the_ru>ok
(09:10:42)<the_ru>and you are?
(09:11:16)<oeb>27 a few days after his birthdaty
(09:11:22)<the_ru>ok
(09:11:22)<oeb>And unable to type =P
(09:11:37)<the_ru>when I set my array like this
(09:11:38)<the_ru>$base_notes = array(1 => 9, 2 => 2, 3 => 6, 4 => 9);
(09:11:39)<the_ru>it works
(09:11:44)<the_ru>but not if I do
(09:11:52)<the_ru>$base_notes =
(09:11:52)<the_ru>  array(
(09:11:52)<the_ru>    1 => $tunings[$tuning_to_use][1],
(09:11:52)<the_ru>    2 => $tunings[$tuning_to_use][2],
(09:11:52)<the_ru>    3 => $tunings[$tuning_to_use][3],
(09:11:54)<the_ru>    4 => $tunings[$tuning_to_use][4]
(09:11:57)<the_ru>  );
(09:12:02)<the_ru>where
(09:12:07)<the_ru>$tunings =
(09:12:07)<the_ru>  array(
(09:12:08)<the_ru>    0 => array("name" => "Soprano (ADF#B)", 1 => 9,  2 => 2,  3 => 6,  4 => 11),
(09:12:32)<the_ru>and $tuning_to_use is the index
(09:13:05)<oeb>Are you getting $tuning_to_use from $_GET[]?
(09:13:17)<the_ru>yes,
(09:13:25)<the_ru>but I've also tried setting it manually
(09:13:27)<oeb>are you passing it through intval?
(09:13:32)<the_ru>just before I use it
(09:14:09)<oeb>hmm, let me fiddle with it
(09:14:28)<the_ru>it's all in the "global scope" BTW
(09:14:36)<the_ru>so no problem with globals or anything
(09:15:22)<the_ru>the $base_notes indices seem to be null when I use them later
(09:16:18)<the_ru>must be something that goes wrong when I build $base_notes
(09:16:47)<the_ru>this is exactly why I don't want to write anything large in a scripting language :-(
(09:18:46)<the_ru>ah
(09:18:49)<the_ru>what the hell
(09:18:59)<the_ru>$tuning_in_use = 2;
(09:18:59)<the_ru>$tuning_name = $tunings[$tuning_to_use]["name"];
(09:19:09)<the_ru>no wonder it doesn't work :-/
(09:21:24)<the_ru>indeed, now it works
(09:22:47)<oeb>haa haa
(09:22:58)<oeb>I was just after starting apache and all =(
(09:23:30)<the_ru>that's another problem... there's no good way to debug PHP code
(09:23:43)<the_ru>without getting the Zend IDEs, I suppose
(09:24:50)<oeb>I have zend =)
(09:25:37)<oeb>I also thing eclipse has a debugger
(09:27:02)<the_ru>but can it parse a script and view the HTML output?
(09:27:08)<the_ru>that's often where the problems appear
(09:27:24)<the_ru>the HTML is hard to read since there's no indentation
(09:27:36)<the_ru>and if it is added, the PHP gets hard to read instead
(09:27:46)<oeb>I have no idea
(09:27:55)<oeb>I have only used zend and komodo
(09:31:41)<the_ru>heh
(09:32:07)<the_ru>now what about those cookies
(09:33:28)<oeb>What? Using cookies in PHP?
(09:35:42)<the_ru>hm
(09:36:12)<the_ru>well, this is another of those things
(09:36:32)<the_ru>I've uploaded the script to a server
(09:36:32)<the_ru>but all it produces is a white page
(09:36:57)<the_ru>without access to the servers logs, how am I supposed to know what's wrong?
(09:37:36)<the_ru>although in this case I figured it out
(09:37:36)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/ukulele.php
(09:37:54)<oeb>Turn on error reporting
(09:38:04)<the_ru>where?
(09:38:07)<oeb>most servers have errors turned off for security reasons
(09:38:25)<oeb>.htaccess for sitewide, for scriptwise put it at the start of your script
(09:38:43)<oeb><?php
(09:38:43)<oeb>ini_set("display_errors","2");
(09:38:43)<oeb>ERROR_REPORTING(E_ALL);
(09:40:01)<the_ru>ah, yes
(09:40:04)<the_ru>found it
(09:40:08)<the_ru>but; on that page
(09:40:30)<the_ru>when I click "find chord", how should I remember what tuning the user had selected?
(09:41:31)<the_ru>I'm pondering moving the tuning to its own form
(09:41:34)<oeb>A session
(09:41:37)<the_ru>first, you select a tuning
(09:41:41)<the_ru>that's stored in a cookie
(09:41:46)<oeb>Use sessions
(09:41:51)<oeb>They are easier to work with
(09:41:58)<the_ru>are they persistant?
(09:42:19)<oeb>Only for this session
(09:42:59)<the_ru>a normal cookie would actually be more useful then
(09:43:11)<the_ru>since it would remember for next time what tuning you use
(09:43:37)<oeb>(A session lasts until it is idle for a specific amount of times, normally 30 min, or until the browser closes)
(09:44:11)<oeb>Sessions are very like cookies, except only an id is stored on the users machine (In a cookie), all the information is stored on the server
(09:44:46)<the_ru>ok
(09:44:55)<the_ru>never bothered to learn to use them
(09:45:20)<oeb>http://ie2.php.net/manual/en/features.cookies.php
(09:46:01)<the_ru>but OTOH, what if the user can't use cookies
(09:46:09)<the_ru>or doesn't want to, rather
(09:47:07)<the_ru>I suppose I could attach a ?tuning=$tuning_to_use to all links where it's relevant
(09:50:53)<oeb>See sessions support that kinda stuff
(09:51:09)<oeb>But basicially, yes you could
(10:07:19)<the_ru>Parse error: syntax error, unexpected $end in /files1/home/ru/www/new_stuff/ukulele.php on line 532
(10:07:23)<the_ru>so how do I find that?
(10:16:38)<the_ru>hm
(10:16:40)<the_ru>found it
(10:28:40)<oeb>That means you are missing a } somewhere
(10:28:54)<oeb>(normally)
(10:40:44)<the_ru>yeah, a <?php
(10:48:42)<the_ru>so, a final problem
(10:48:57)<the_ru>what if I need a variable number of radio buttons
(10:49:14)<the_ru>should I just name them like stringN where N is its index
(10:54:09)<oeb>Ya
(10:54:28)<oeb>Or else name them name="radioname[]" and deal with them like an array
(10:56:22)<the_ru>will $HTTP_GET_VARS["string"] contain an array then?
(10:57:59)<the_ru>for example, if I have radiobuttons string[1-10]
(10:58:34)<the_ru>will $_GET["string"] be an array with ten entries, each containing the value of the chosen radiobutton?
(11:03:12)<the_ru>huh
(11:03:21)<the_ru>so why won't radiobuttons appear checked now...
(11:16:00)<the_ru>oh
(11:16:00)<the_ru>they would
(11:16:07)<the_ru>almost done now

(11:21:57)<deveah>hello
(11:22:23)<deveah>today I'm making my sewer-generator
(11:28:25)<the_ru>ok
(11:28:41)<the_ru>I really appreciate you want to share this moment with us
(11:29:36)<deveah>moi?
(11:43:58)<deveah>okay, i pick a random location
(11:44:05)<deveah>i make a room there
(11:44:23)<deveah>then i set either x or y +1 or -1
(11:44:38)<the_ru>does your sewers have rooms?
(11:44:50)<deveah>if i use x, i'll make either a horizontal cooridor, or another filled room
(11:44:59)<deveah>if i use y, i'll make either a vertical cooridor, or another filled room
(11:45:09)<deveah>now: how to do it?
(11:45:13)<deveah>it works on paper
(11:45:30)<deveah>the_ru: yes
(11:47:14)<the_ru>ouch
(11:47:45)<the_ru>building the dungeon by knocking out random walls is really hard you know
(11:48:20)<deveah>hard?
(11:49:22)<deveah>http://rafb.net/p/uXowhU67.html
(11:49:36)<deveah>r, room type
(11:49:43)<deveah>x, direction
(11:49:50)<deveah>cx, cy, current x and y
(11:50:43)<the_ru>it's hard to make them produce something useful
(11:51:06)<the_ru>depends on what kind of dungeon you want of course
(11:51:31)<the_ru>they get very hard to manage once you start adding constraints
(11:51:46)<the_ru>such as corridors not running into each other or into rooms
(11:52:23)<the_ru>\../
(11:52:42)<deveah>i'm ready to accept anything, i want a good map generator
(11:52:45)<deveah>ANY KIND
(11:54:10)<the_ru>you can keep writing generators for a lifetime and never be fully happy with their results :-)
(11:54:31)<deveah>i want a map generator
(11:54:44)<the_ru>so write one
(11:54:50)<deveah>i want help
(11:55:02)<the_ru>it's not hard to write one, but it takes time to write one that does what you want
(11:55:17)<deveah>so i want some help to make one
(11:55:28)<deveah>let's say splitroom algorithm
(11:55:39)<the_ru>yes,
(11:55:50)<the_ru>but that's very different from a random walk
(11:56:25)<deveah>what's the simplest algotithm to make a dungeon?
(11:58:25)<the_ru>randomly setting tiles to floor or wall
(11:58:47)<deveah>not that kind
(11:59:00)<deveah>a dungeon, not 'forest'
(11:59:12)<the_ru>forest, cave
(11:59:21)<the_ru>it's all just a matter of what wall tile you use
(11:59:30)<the_ru>I'd say splitting rooms
(12:00:09)<the_ru>but you will need a solid understanding of recursion
(12:00:54)<deveah>recursion is...
(12:01:10)<jomiolto>recursion: see recursion :P
(12:01:15)<the_ru>:-)
(12:01:19)<the_ru>a function calling itself
(12:01:38)<the_ru>or f1 calling f2, that calls f1
(12:02:07)<deveah>oh, i know that
(12:02:13)<jomiolto>the_ru: doom metal? what band(s)?
(12:02:17)<the_ru>you must carefully define a stop condition or it will keep doing it forever, and eventually crash when it runs out of stack space
(12:02:21)<deveah>i use it sometimes when the vars aren't good
(12:02:23)<the_ru>jomiolto: runemagick
(12:02:33)<jomiolto>hmm, I don't think I've heard of it :/
(12:02:40)<deveah>the function calls itself until the vars come good
(12:04:17)<the_ru>but; there are no easy generators
(12:04:27)<the_ru>if they were, we wouldn't all be writing them all the time
(12:07:02)<deveah>how about that L-jump algorithm ?
(12:07:36)<the_ru>I dunno
(12:07:41)<the_ru>it could work, I guess
(12:07:42)<the_ru>try it
(12:08:12)<deveah>but i want a sewer generator
(12:08:14)<deveah>darn
(12:10:44)<Glowie>What was wrong with my suggestion
(12:11:14)<the_ru>what did you suggest?
(12:11:41)<Glowie>Just start with a dungeon[80][25] array with full of #, write a few functions for creating a room of a certain size and at a certain location, same with a corrridor and use the loop I said yesterday
(12:13:08)<Glowie>I suggested it yesterday, starting with full of #, picking a random starting location and adding a room there, then looping through: 1. pick a suitable wall, 2. create n number of corridors, 3. create a room at the end of the corridors and loop, having a check somewhere not to get overlapping parts
(12:13:43)<Glowie>Shouldn't be hard at all when you understand the idea behind the algorithm, then just start experimenting what works for you
(12:14:24)<Glowie>Also if you don't want rooms, skip the create room part
(12:41:30)<deveah>HA!
(12:41:38)<deveah>MY SEWER GENERATOR WORKS!
(12:51:15)<Glowie>Good job
(12:54:02)<deveah>http://www.imagehost.ro/pict/241359404837f51c63e53.PNG
(12:54:17)<deveah># empty room; - and | cooridors
(12:56:45)<Glowie>A bit different way of showing the dungeon I see. Though the corridors aren't very corridorish if they are only 1 tile long like rooms
(12:58:44)<deveah>i'll work on it and add some sizxe limiting
(12:59:04)<deveah>if size_of_dungeon<20 then make_dungeon
(12:59:16)<deveah>if size_of_dungeon>50 then make_dungeon
(12:59:18)<deveah>and so on...
(01:07:09)<deveah>done.
(01:07:29)<deveah>playtime!
(01:26:17)<jraregris>cool
(01:26:37)<jraregris>in some sense my sewer generator works too.
(01:37:34)<deveah>what does your one look like?
(01:43:25)<jraregris>Looks like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks
(01:44:53)<deveah>nice
(01:45:30)<deveah>for an algorithm, that is :D
(01:45:52)<jraregris>yeah.
(01:46:11)<jraregris>in truth i have no sewer-algorithm
(01:46:24)<deveah>no shit
(01:47:40)<jraregris>none
(01:48:20)<deveah>hey vons
(01:48:23)<jraregris>yours looks really cool, though.
(01:48:36)<vons>hi
(01:49:52)<deveah>are you a dev or just a player?
(01:50:32)<vons>just player but i learn :P
(01:51:49)<vons>i try do rougelike game in php.
(01:51:54)<deveah>jraregis - the code is small, too
(01:52:44)<deveah>http://rafb.net/p/20OtbT88.html
(02:00:57)<Glowie>All in a single function o_o
(02:01:22)<Glowie>I think a drunkard's walk with random #, - and | symbols would do the same
(02:17:05)<deveah>no, | and might not be connected with that thing
(02:18:10)<Glowie>Mm yeah would need a few more ifs to get that, true
(02:32:10)<the_ru>for the zillionth time I will copy the same LOS code :-/
(02:33:41)<the_ru>but adapt it slightly for the current situation
(02:39:34)<Glowie>I think a simplistic LOS works well in overworld, like just decreasing vision when you're in a forest and not seeing through highest mountains
(02:40:23)<the_ru>yes, that's what I'm doing
(02:40:32)<the_ru>in forests you will be limited to 9 tiles
(02:41:03)<the_ru>on open plains, you can see at most 5 tiles away
(02:43:38)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/pub/0.12-owlos.png
(02:44:16)<Glowie>Looks good
(02:44:43)<jraregris>Yeah
(02:47:15)<RotateMe>yep, nice
(02:48:59)<jraregris>What will happen at the RLMeetup?
(02:49:40)<the_ru>there will probably be beer drinking
(02:49:55)<the_ru>I would pass on that though
(02:50:03)<jraregris>And everyone will learn how everybody else pronounces things :)
(02:50:16)<the_ru>there's also a chance of RLs being played
(02:50:25)<jraregris>RealLifeRL
(02:51:46)<the_ru>so is there any host yet?
(02:52:45)<the_ru>It just won't move past "idea" unless someone is willing to organize :-)
(03:01:16)<Glowie>Wouldn't it work if everyone met at a hotel, got a big room and started dungeon exploring in D&D :P
(03:02:57)<the_ru>sure
(03:03:06)<the_ru>so, which hotel? :-)
(03:09:42)<Glowie>I can't come, so I don't think I'm the right one to suggest hotels :P
(03:09:57)<the_ru>why not?
(03:10:09)<RotateMe>yeah, the date's not finally decided yet, is it?
(03:10:23)<the_ru>RotateMe: nothing is decided, that's the problem
(03:10:40)<the_ru>that's why I think someone should just say a date and then see how many can come
(03:10:47)<RotateMe>yeah :(
(03:11:09)<the_ru>we could have it in my town but it's too far to travel
(03:11:18)<RotateMe>i'd say come to my place in berlin then and then but i haven't moved yet and i dont know what my new place will be like
(03:11:38)<Glowie>I'm serving in the military at the probable time of the meet
(03:11:53)<RotateMe>ugh
(03:12:00)<the_ru>Glowie: ok. but you can still suggest a hotel :-O
(03:12:07)<RotateMe>^^
(03:12:37)<the_ru>or we can have a LARP wherever you're stationed
(03:13:11)<the_ru>and hope you don't have sharp ammo
(03:13:50)<RotateMe>Glowie: you have to go to the military because you've finished school or is it voluntary (or for money)
(03:16:42)<deveah>http://www.imagehost.ro/pict/2416222948381695b9005.PNG
(03:16:49)<deveah>sewer generator 2.0
(03:17:28)<the_ru>should there only be 1-tile corridors?
(03:18:15)<Glowie>Haha modern warfare LARP
(03:18:28)<Glowie>It's not voluntary in Finland
(03:18:39)<Glowie>Conscription.
(03:19:07)<Glowie>Either 12 months of civilian service, at least 6 months of military service or jail
(03:19:31)<Glowie>But I've finished school too, but that's not really the reason I'm going there
(03:20:53)<RotateMe>about the same here in germany
(03:20:59)<RotateMe>chose civil service though
(03:21:07)<RotateMe>got to drive the ambulance car
(03:21:41)<Glowie>Most pick military only because it wastes less of your time
(03:23:36)<RotateMe>i had my job assured a year before i started so i would have had half a year of free time if i chose military service
(03:23:54)<RotateMe>which would have led to (even more) serious drinking problems i guess ^^
(03:24:04)<Glowie>Bah, drinking is for the weak :P
(03:26:29)<RotateMe>my aa group will find your house and burn it down for saying that :P
(03:27:06)<Glowie>Haha
(04:27:21)<the_ru>I was lucky and didn't have to do any service at all
(04:27:36)<the_ru>most people in my generation don't
(04:27:54)<the_ru>20 years ago, it was very different
(04:33:09)<the_ru>Glowie: we expect you to defend us, I suppose
(06:38:09)<vons>hey i try use LOS script: http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=LOS_by_Odd    what is this: "double s = double(.99/(dx&gtdy?dx:dy));"
(06:41:05)<jomiolto>it's got html entities in it. The &gt should be a >
(06:41:18)<jomiolto>similarly all those "&lt"s should be <
(06:41:26)<vons>ok thx
(06:42:18)<vons>now its work :D
(06:47:02)<jomiolto>does it look better now? I fixed the formatting a bit
(06:47:29)<vons>yee nice
(06:47:41)<jomiolto>erm, and I hope I'm allowed to do that, not being the author of that article (but it's a _wiki_ anyway :)
(06:48:05)<vons>:)
(07:04:47)<the_ru>that's pretty much the point of a wiki
(07:04:58)<the_ru>and I doubt it was intended to have errors :-)
(09:04:56)<the_ru>I suppose everyone is watching
(09:05:40)<joe6pack>of course
(09:06:20)<Glowie>You can't lose with metal \o/
(09:06:30)<Glowie>Not that I'm watching
(09:09:19)<joe6pack>urm, watching what?
(09:09:43)<Glowie>Exactly
(09:09:57)<joe6pack>metal?
(09:10:05)<Glowie>Eurovision
(09:10:12)<joe6pack>oh
(09:10:32)<joe6pack>wasn't the last one only a couple of months ago?
(09:10:54)<Glowie>Some 12 months I guess
(09:11:09)<joe6pack>:|
(10:01:24)<the_ru>heh
(10:01:30)<the_ru>just retuned one of my guitars
(10:01:37)<the_ru>all strings are now B
(10:01:46)<the_ru>great for drone music
+++ The date has changed: 2008/05/25 +++
(06:23:23)<MadCacti>hola
(06:23:28)<MadCacti>what happened to the topic
(06:23:35)<MadCacti>I want my link of the day! :'(
(09:52:38)<the_ru>that is the link of the day
(09:52:39)<the_ru>every day
(10:10:08)<the_ru>hm
(10:10:20)<the_ru>problem:
(10:10:46)<the_ru>when reading scrolls
(10:10:56)<the_ru>I take the scroll out of the players inventory first
(10:11:06)<the_ru>then do the spell effect
(10:11:10)<the_ru>then destroy the scroll
(10:11:45)<the_ru>but; some spells can end the game without passing control back to where the scroll is
(10:12:27)<the_ru>so sometimes I lose the pointer
(10:13:25)<the_ru>and I don't want to make the magic function itself responsible for deleting the scroll
(10:13:42)<the_ru>but; maybe it could, in this particular case
(10:14:07)<the_ru>it doesn't matter if the "old" pointer gets invalid, since execution won't get back there anyway
(10:16:06)<MadCacti>but
(10:16:17)<MadCacti>who cares if you leak a single scroll?
(10:16:26)<MadCacti>the game is about to end anyway, isn't it?
(10:16:26)<the_ru>I do
(10:17:00)<MadCacti>well, a game over condition would free the memory, wouldn't it?
(10:17:05)<MadCacti>so it's not a leak ;
(10:17:07)<MadCacti>;)
(10:17:23)<MadCacti>(assuming you can't play again without quitting
(10:17:26)<the_ru>... and my players will notice as well, since my memory debug code will protest
(10:17:33)<MadCacti>:(
(10:17:49)<the_ru>Memory Usage
(10:17:52)<the_ru>72 chars
(10:17:52)<the_ru>  (72 bytes)
(10:17:55)<the_ru>1 item_t
(10:17:55)<the_ru>  (532 bytes)
(10:18:05)<MadCacti>is this C?
(10:18:10)<the_ru>yes
(10:18:24)<MadCacti>there are garbage collectors for C :P
(10:18:35)<the_ru>I keep track of how many I allocate
(10:22:24)<the_ru>and it's a small and silly problem, I agree
(10:22:35)<the_ru>but if I allocate something, I want to free it myself
(10:22:43)<purestrain>haha... poor c/c++ people... D has a built in garbage collector =D
(10:24:04)<the_ru>but where's the challenge?
(10:27:04)<the_ru>hm
(10:27:12)<oeb>Morning guys
(10:27:13)<the_ru>I have two problems
(10:27:20)<the_ru>it's the magic and trap systems
(10:27:29)<oeb>And on another note, Woo Munster!
(10:27:32)<the_ru>the don't play by the same rules as the rest of the code
(10:28:08)<the_ru>they live in their own world, and can exit the program when they want to
(10:31:46)<the_ru>another option would be to move the check for player death from the explosion code to the casting code
(10:32:06)<purestrain>what are you doing? =)
(10:32:10)<the_ru>but then it would be doing things it's not really supposed to do
(10:32:21)<purestrain>'they live in their own world' - 'can exit the program'
(10:32:27)<the_ru>solving bugs
(10:32:42)<purestrain>player casts the magic exit program spell
(10:33:18)<the_ru>I let my magic and traps exit the program if the player is killed, which can result in pointers being left allocated
(10:33:34)<the_ru>and some other bad things as well
(10:37:50)<the_ru>the pointers are because of my choice of language
(10:38:33)<the_ru>but there are other things in the game logic that would appear in any language
(10:39:04)<the_ru>such as dualwielding two weapons, where the first has a random chance of teleporting the target away
(11:00:32)<the_ru>and I don't get why my fireballs won't explode on the top and left edges of the map
(11:03:25)<Glowie>Maybe the explosion tries to access map[-1][-1] or something?
(11:03:41)<the_ru>yes, but I check that
(11:04:04)<the_ru>the function is called, since I get a "you hear an explosion" message
(11:04:09)<the_ru>but no tiles are affected
(11:04:27)<the_ru>OTOH, explosions on the bottom/right map edges work fine
(11:04:47)<Glowie>Debugging it is then
(11:07:52)<the_ru>oook
(11:07:54)<the_ru>(gdb) print y
(11:07:57)<the_ru>$1 = 135098040
(11:08:03)<the_ru>I think we have a problem here
(11:08:11)<Glowie>:P
(11:08:56)<MadCacti>I don't know if I still have any faith in debuggers
(11:09:30)<MadCacti>I can't remember them being more effective than just reading the code and throwing in some printfs even once
(11:10:15)<the_ru>yes
(11:10:24)<the_ru>but they can also do things like watch variables
(11:10:27)<the_ru>even if it's slow
(11:10:58)<the_ru>stack traces - can't get those with printf
(11:11:29)<the_ru>you can even force a return from whatever function you're in
(11:11:45)<MadCacti>last I tried to watch a variable, which seemed like the magic solution to my bug, it didn't work because the program segfaulted randomly instead
(11:12:13)<MadCacti>(this was a memory corruption bug which appeared to always hit the same variable)
(11:12:32)<joe6pack>debugger? 
(11:12:36)<MadCacti>gdb
(11:12:38)<the_ru>in this case
(11:12:45)<the_ru>#0  explosion (level=0x80d6eb8, cause=0x80c4a48, source=0x0, center_y=0, 
(11:12:45)<the_ru>    center_x=16, e_type=expl_fireball, dam=3, watch=0x0, casualty=0x0)
(11:12:45)<the_ru>    at magic.c:441
(11:13:15)<the_ru>I won't need to chase the faulty variable all throughout the code, it must have been corrupted in explosion()
(11:14:32)<MadCacti>yes, that's useful
(11:14:57)<MadCacti>but once you've reached that point, in my experience it's time to throw away the debugger and just read explosion() very carefully
(11:15:28)<joe6pack>c can be such a pain to debug sometimes
(11:22:10)<the_ru>I don't get where these numbers are coming from
(11:22:25)<the_ru>for (y = center_y - 1; y <= center_y + 1; y++)
(11:22:44)<the_ru>how can that produce 135098040 from y = 0?
(11:22:56)<joe6pack>wrap around?
(11:23:02)<joe6pack>of unsigned int?
(11:23:06)<MadCacti>P:
(11:23:28)<joe6pack>if center_y is 0, that is
(11:24:11)<the_ru>hm
(11:24:15)<the_ru>yes, that's what I meant
(11:24:25)<the_ru>center_y = 0, not y
(11:24:43)<joe6pack>there you go then :)
(11:24:52)<the_ru>hm
(11:25:04)<the_ru>center_y is unsigned actually
(11:25:18)<the_ru>with an explicit cast to signed before - 1 it works
(11:25:31)<the_ru>but that makes me wonder, shouldn't it cast that automatically
(11:25:39)<joe6pack>nope
(11:25:43)<the_ru>y = (signed)center_y - 1
(11:26:05)<the_ru>shouldn't it cast it to the size of the destination variable?
(11:26:12)<joe6pack>nope
(11:26:16)<joe6pack>this is c not java
(11:27:46)<the_ru>but anyway, where *does* that number come from?
(11:28:22)<the_ru>it's not even close to any multiple of 2 I know
(11:29:15)<TMC2>well that loop should repeat over and over
(11:29:31)<the_ru>ah
(11:29:35)<the_ru>yes, you're correct
(11:29:47)<the_ru>anyway, problem solved
(11:29:48)<TMC2>wait, no I'm not
(11:30:32)<TMC2>in center_y is unsigned, and y is signed
(11:30:50)<TMC2>shouldn't center_y - 1 produce 2^32 - 1
(11:31:03)<TMC2>so shouldn't y be set to -1 anyway?
(11:31:04)<joe6pack>i think it should
(11:31:54)<joe6pack>c arcana...
(11:33:32)<the_ru>it should overflow in the other direction, yes
(11:33:54)<the_ru>(should)
(11:34:36)<the_ru>conclusion - we have too powerful computers
(11:34:42)<the_ru>we don't have any idea how they work
(11:35:50)<joe6pack>the computers aren't too powerful 
(11:35:55)<joe6pack>we are too ignorant 
(11:36:51)<joe6pack>i am sure there is some simple explanation for it, we just don't know c well enough
(11:38:55)<Glowie>That's part of its coolness, like working with black magic \o/
(11:39:03)<joe6pack>hehe
(11:39:06)<joe6pack>exactly 
(11:39:26)<joe6pack>when i grow up i want to be a c shaman 
(11:39:37)<joe6pack>or is it witch doctor?
(11:39:40)<TMC2>it's fun when your hardware or your language works like black magic
(11:40:04)<TMC2>it's not so cool when your OS or your libraries act seemingly randomly :(
(11:40:34)<the_ru>joe6pack: they're too powerful for our level of knowledge
(11:40:50)<the_ru>just like nuclear weapons are
(11:41:39)<joe6pack>the_ru: you could have gotten the same kind of bug on an apple ][
(11:41:57)<joe6pack>it stems from a misunderstanding of the language, not the power of the computer
(11:42:15)<the_ru>well, an apple ][ isn't stone age either
(11:42:30)<TMC2>it stems from C being a stone age language :P
(12:05:02)<TMC2>a topic :o

(02:50:45)<the_ru>I picked by electric bass apart
(02:51:01)<the_ru>every single screw
(02:51:06)<the_ru>cleaned it
(02:51:13)<the_ru>(lots of sawdust in there for some reason)
(02:51:19)<the_ru>then put it back together
(02:51:24)<the_ru>tuned it
(02:51:43)<the_ru>corrected the intonation a bit, but I didn't get it 100% rigt
(02:51:45)<the_ru>right
(02:51:50)<the_ru>took two hours
(02:54:38)<TMC2>sawdust? :S
(02:57:50)<the_ru>yeah
(02:58:00)<the_ru>I suppose they didn't care to clean it out when the put it together
(02:58:21)<the_ru>built in asia somewhere
(02:58:59)<the_ru>they could have blown it away with some high-pressure air
(03:10:28)<jraregris>i did a similar thing to my guitar a couple of weeks back
(03:11:03)<jraregris>and when i screwed it together I tuned it perfectly by ear, which is pretty cool. no reference or tuner.
(03:11:16)<jraregris>440 spot on
(03:13:31)<the_ru>I just wish I could adjust my ukulele

(09:23:50)<oeb>morning
(09:32:34)<TMC2>'evening
(09:46:44)<TMC2>"Yep, mainly for "xenophobism"..."
(09:46:50)<TMC2>:O :O :O
(01:49:34)<greg>hi guys
(02:35:57)<MadCacti>hi
(02:50:36)<oeb_werk>2 weeks left. Woo
(05:30:13)<deveah>question
(05:30:21)<deveah>should I buy a PlayStation 2?
(05:30:44)<deveah>the prices are low and I found somebody who mods it
(05:30:55)<deveah>for 5 euros
(05:41:57)<jraregris>I think the PS2 is what gives you most value for your money today.
(05:42:43)<jraregris>Nearly every relatively new game is supported, except from the two couple of last years.
(05:42:51)<deveah>i don't care
(05:42:55)<deveah>i don't like new games
(05:42:59)<jraregris>me neither
(05:43:01)<jraregris>:)
(05:43:25)<jraregris>But compared to a SNES, you get a lot more for the money on a PS2.
(05:43:45)<jraregris>And the PS2 can play all the PS1 games better.
(05:44:13)<jraregris>(Well it might not be `better', but at least as good)
(05:47:04)<RotateMe>if you mod it you can play about every console out there
(05:47:08)<deveah>so I should go for it, right?
(05:47:22)<RotateMe>except for those crappy new age consoles like ps3 and stuff
(05:47:23)<jraregris>I'd. :)
(05:47:28)<RotateMe>me too
(05:48:43)<jraregris>For me it's still a little expensive. Not for it's worth, but because I'm a poor student, and already have a lot of games for NES, SNES, SMD, PS1, GBA and PC I haven't played through.
(05:49:03)<deveah>well this would be my 1st console. . .
(05:49:38)<jraregris>So every time I find myself wanting a PS2 I save my money and dust off some of my old hardware
(05:49:39)<jraregris>ah
(05:50:14)<deveah>I have the money for 1 PS2s, from the school money and stuff
(05:50:54)<jraregris>If it's your first console, you'd probably not share the same enthusiasm for old games pre-PS as I do. But then again you're a RL-guy, so what do I know?
(05:52:14)<deveah>I'm a retro guy
(05:52:38)<deveah>I own a ZX Spectrum (2 but I keep one for the parts)
(05:52:48)<oeb_werk>I have a working 2600 still
(05:53:01)<deveah>an Amiga 2600?
(05:53:06)<oeb_werk>Atari
(05:53:11)<deveah>oh yes
(05:53:20)<oeb_werk>I sold adventure though =(
(05:53:27)<deveah>i have 539 games for Atari 2600 in 4mb :D
(05:53:30)<oeb_werk>In a second hand shop when I was 8
(05:53:53)<oeb_werk>It's an atari jr. model. You know the one with 99 games built in?
(05:54:09)<oeb_werk>I have river raid and centipide still on cartrige too.
(05:54:55)<oeb_werk>I think the best purchase I bought in recent years is the DS though.
(05:55:16)<oeb_werk>Especially if you buy a Slot 1 memory card reader. Some of the homebrew stuff is neat
(05:55:45)<oeb_werk>Playing powder on the DS is much more enjoyable than playing Dweller on my phone.
(05:56:03)<oeb_werk>right, I'm off home, back in 15 min
(06:00:52)<RotateMe>oeb: tried Izuna for the DS?
(06:01:53)<RotateMe>deveah: if you're getting a ps2 you might want to get a modded one right away, because sending it in, having it modded (mod chip + work) and sending it back to you is way more expensive then a used moded model
(06:04:20)<jraregris>I modded my NES. :)
(06:04:43)<jraregris>I was going to disable the lock-out-chip so I could play US Final Fantasy.
(06:04:54)<jraregris>But i clipped the wrong pin.
(06:07:40)<Aerton>hi there
(06:09:55)<jraregris>luckily I was able to bend it int place, and it worked
(06:12:48)<deveah>RotateMe - as soon as I buy one I'll send it to modding
(06:12:59)<deveah>well go w/it to mod, it takes ~20 mins
(06:13:24)<deveah>making ANSi art for school is fun
(06:32:41)<oeb>RotateMe, yes, I think Mystery Dungeon is better though
(06:34:16)<oeb>hmm putting windows back on my laptop. It really cant handle ubuntu.
(06:34:33)<oeb>Never thought I would see the day when windows runs better than linux =P
(06:35:31)<RotateMe>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon?
(06:35:43)<RotateMe>didn't it get horrible reviews
(06:35:46)<oeb>No, Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the wanderer
(06:35:51)<RotateMe>aaaah okay
(06:35:53)<RotateMe>i agree
(06:35:54)<oeb>Same series, different licence
(06:36:10)<RotateMe>this one was awesome... isn't it for snes?
(06:36:17)<oeb>I find izuna more of a boring grind
(06:36:25)<oeb>Ya, I think it's a remake of a snes game
(06:36:51)<oeb>izuna: go level up, die, repeat until you can trash everything in sight with your bare hands.
(06:37:08)<oeb>They are very pretty games, but powder still get's played more =P
(06:37:43)<oeb>That being said, I think they are both great introductins to this genre.
(06:44:03)<RotateMe>i thought a little more of shiren
(06:44:25)<RotateMe>it had concepts and an overall feel that's not found in any other roguelike
(06:44:33)<RotateMe>and it's just as hard as others
(06:46:32)<deveah>I get the God of War II game free with my Ps2 :D
(06:48:47)<RotateMe>how much will it be together?
(06:50:51)<Aerton>do you have to wait a few years before you can legally play it? :)
(06:53:43)<deveah>154 euros w/2 controllers, God of War II and a 8mb memorycard
(06:54:26)<Aerton>is it the new model?
(06:54:34)<deveah>i think it is
(06:54:39)<deveah>wait
(06:55:11)<RotateMe>hm i just found that in germany it's no longer legal to mod sony consoles :(
(06:55:35)<deveah>ps2 S2B2005
(06:55:49)<RotateMe>but before that you could've gotten a brandnew moded ps2 + controller and memory card for 170 in my favourite shop
(06:56:33)<RotateMe>wow, i heard a lot about god of war, but until i just looked it up i though it was some american war themed ego shooter
(06:56:45)<deveah>me too
(06:57:03)<RotateMe>looks like a pretty good game, the ratings are the most awesome i've seen in a long time
(06:57:53)<deveah>what I like about consoles is that you'll never find a game on a certain console that doesn't work because hardware needs
(06:58:50)<Aerton>definitely one of the most technically advanced games on ps2 (hadn't actually played it to comment on gameplay)
(06:59:23)<RotateMe>yeah... plus it's a complete and finished game, there won't be no patches so they can't roll it out until it's fully finished
(06:59:35)<Aerton>well, some games still have lousy frame rates :/
(06:59:48)<RotateMe>especially newer games
(07:00:04)<deveah>and 90% of ps2 games have cheats! ^^
(07:00:05)<Aerton>although, it's much better than a usually pc
(07:00:15)<RotateMe>FF 12 amazed me, the framerate was awesome and the graphics the best i've seen for ps2
(07:01:54)<Aerton>I want to find ps2 remake of rogue
(07:02:10)<Aerton>too bad it's japan-only
(07:04:44)<RotateMe>rogue hearts
(07:05:55)<RotateMe>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRycPVBByaE
(07:06:00)<RotateMe>looks awesome
(07:07:45)<purestrain>looks like egoboo
(07:43:05)<RotateMe>i's not 3d ... i think it has some pretty good 2d graphics
(07:43:23)<RotateMe>plus it's said to be pretty true to the original rogue

(10:42:10)<greg>hi there
(10:52:45)<TMCSleeps>hi
(11:41:20)<jraregris>hoi
(11:51:23)<oeb_werk>http://cgempire.com/forum/tutorials-101/terror-ascii-dungeon-c-tutorial-codephobes-part-1-a-379.html
(11:51:30)<oeb_werk>Just found that when browsing
(11:51:39)<oeb_werk>Dunno is it any good though, only skimmed it
(02:37:37)<TMC2>wow
(02:38:25)<TMC2>inability to solve a simple maths problem is exactly the same thing as not being able to see the cause of a simple programming bug
(02:42:06)<oeb_werk>Yup!
(02:42:13)<oeb_werk>Happens to me all the time!
(02:48:45)<greg><oeb_werk> if you are interested by game making tutorials :  http://pixwiki.bafsoft.com/mags/
(02:51:10)<oeb_werk>neat, thanks greg
(02:51:45)<greg>;)
(02:53:30)<oeb_werk>Just downloaded the lot of them. I will be with laptop but without internet connection tonight and have a few hours to kill
(02:54:58)<greg>yep some articles likes how to make a scroll map, or introduction to scripting are quite interesting. i have learned programming with those magazines
(02:55:16)<TMC2>well this is funny
(02:55:43)<TMC2>I was searching for some information related to a problem on a maths assignment
(02:56:08)<TMC2>and I found tables of the largest known graphs with given degree and diameter
(02:56:29)<TMC2>and was quite surprised to find my lecturer's name on most of the referenced publications
(02:56:39)<TMC2>http://maite71.upc.es/grup_de_grafs/table_g.html
(02:56:47)<TMC2>he even showed us this page in class
(02:57:00)<TMC2>(that happens to be the answer to the problem at the top of the page)
(02:57:15)<TMC2>he didn't mention that he'd calculated the majority of the numbers on that table :P
(02:58:15)<TMC2>another one of my lecturers also has found a large number of graphs
(02:59:54)<oeb_werk>greg, I had never heard of pixelate before. What was it?
(03:01:52)<greg>well, pixelate was a magazine on game programming which was made by the allegro community 
(03:02:40)<oeb_werk>Seems to be a fair bit there
(03:02:43)<greg>www.allegro.cc (it is a game programming library)
(03:02:48)<oeb_werk>Cant wait to dig in later.
(03:02:57)<oeb_werk>I know what allegro is, never used it though
(03:03:15)<greg>it is a great library, very easy to use
(03:03:36)<oeb_werk>I'm still trying to get my head around ncurses =P
(03:03:49)<TMC2>is allegro still a good choice for non DOS games?
(03:04:23)<greg>yes of course
(03:04:47)<Aerton>SDL pretty much pushed it into oblivion
(03:04:49)<TMC2>it's 2D only, right?
(03:04:53)<greg>allegro is based on direct draw for 2d and opengl (with allegrogl ) for 3d
(03:04:59)<TMC2>ah
(03:05:11)<greg>no you have both 2d and 3d routines in software mode
(03:05:14)<TMC2>wait, is it windows only?
(03:05:20)<Aerton>although, allegro is somewhat more high-level and it can be helpful in some cases
(03:05:32)<greg><TMC2>nop linux and mac too
(03:05:39)<greg>but i use it on windows
(03:05:47)<Glowie>SDL FTW!
(03:05:47)<TMC2>hmm..
(03:05:56)<TMC2>so is there any reason not to use it?
(03:06:06)<greg>no :)
(03:06:14)<greg>it is more simple that sdl
(03:06:24)<TMC2>simple?
(03:06:38)<Glowie>SDL grants easier shift to OpenGL if you need it some time :<
(03:06:45)<Aerton>SDL has a lot cleaner API
(03:06:46)<TMC2>it didn't seem that simple when I had to work with it
(03:06:48)<Glowie>SDL has a lot of great add on libraries
(03:06:52)<greg>yes for exemple: to handle the mouse you have to check 3 variable : mouse_x mouse_y and the var button
(03:06:53)<oeb_werk>Which is a more newbie friendly answer for a roguelike? A pdcurses ASCII game, a SDL tiled game or an Allegro tiled game (In your opinions)
(03:07:05)<Glowie>Also, Aertoooooooooooon \o/
(03:07:14)<Glowie>PDCurses
(03:07:14)<Glowie>By far
(03:07:17)<joe6pack>pdcurses
(03:07:27)<greg>oeb_werk allegro :p
(03:07:47)<oeb_werk>Does it stay as simple as, "Just stick this char at this screen location"
(03:07:54)<greg>http://www.allegro.cc/depot/3059/
(03:08:06)<TMC2>easier shift? I thought you said that allegro used opengl for 3d graphics too?
(03:08:25)<Glowie>Easier shift as in you get in full control of OpenGL, not just a wrapper
(03:08:37)<Glowie>(Or does Allegro give full control too?)
(03:09:05)<greg><TMC2>  http://allegrogl.sourceforge.net/
(03:09:45)<Glowie>Oo
(03:09:46)<Glowie>Nice
(03:09:49)<Glowie>I hadn't heard of that
(03:10:00)<Glowie>I guess it's a considerable alternative then
(03:10:36)<Aerton>I personally see no point in it, unless you already have working codebase
(03:10:40)<Glowie>Is there a network Allegro library too?
(03:10:42)<greg>yes and there is add on to do accelerated 2d quite easyly
(03:10:55)<greg>no ther isn't network code
(03:11:01)<Glowie>Okay
(03:11:39)<Aerton>there is also clanlib for the lovers of obscure libraries
(03:12:11)<greg>http://sourceforge.net/projects/openlayer
(03:12:48)<Aerton>ah, there is also plib (pure 3D)
(03:13:54)<Glowie>I still think SDL is cleaner and more diverse, though I admit that adding those libraries can be a pain sometimes. But I guess Allegro does the trick too for the most part
(03:14:24)<Aerton>it works, there is no denying
(03:15:56)<oeb_werk>The most fun part about this project is re-learning maths I have not used in years.
(03:16:54)<oeb_werk>Hell, I did not even remember pythagoras therom =/
(03:17:09)<greg>:) 
(03:17:31)<oeb_werk>And you kinda need that =P
(03:17:49)<Glowie>Woah
(03:17:55)<Glowie>How can you forget that :P
(03:18:12)<oeb_werk>Luckally a friend of mine teaches highschool maths and physics, and he is always just a phone call away.
(03:18:19)<TMC2>:o
(03:18:21)<oeb_werk>Cause I have not used it in 10 years
(03:18:24)<TMC2>what project?
(03:18:34)<oeb_werk>Angel of Death. My first roguelike.
(03:18:37)<TMC2>I forgot the quadratic formula
(03:18:41)<TMC2>and I'm a maths major :(
(03:18:50)<oeb_werk>Expect a release some time after Krice's next major release.
(03:18:55)<Glowie>Haha
(03:19:49)<oeb_werk>This will just be a coffee break game (Well at this stage). I am making very slow progress cause I dont have a clue what I'm doing.
(03:19:50)<joe6pack>that would be slightly after the rapture, then?
(03:20:00)<oeb_werk>Ohh, and I'm writing it in c, and I don't know c
(03:20:10)<oeb_werk>But that's the easy bit.
(03:20:12)<TMC2>(the back cover is a good place to mark events of an usual temporial location)
(03:20:15)<joe6pack>i didn't know c before i wrote my first rl in it :)
(03:20:22)<joe6pack>the 1 before cryptrover
(03:20:35)<oeb_werk>Like I said, that's the easy bit.
(03:21:07)<TMC2>*unusual
(03:21:11)<oeb_werk>Just a matter of finding the time to allocate to it. I tend to have very little free time.
(03:21:26)<TMC2>I didn't know C before I wrote my first...
(03:21:35)<joe6pack>well you can say that about everything 
(03:21:43)<oeb_werk>I know
(03:21:54)<TMC2>I've even written anything approaching a complete non trivial program in C
(03:22:00)<TMC2>yet I claim to know it
(03:22:06)<TMC2>*never written
(03:22:14)<oeb_werk>Once I can teach a 2 year old to set quitly and watch daddy code I will be sorted.
(03:22:22)<TMC2>D:
(03:23:19)<oeb_werk>Apparently bear in the big blue house is more interesting than c. He will learn one day.
(03:24:09)<oeb_werk>I think I need a todo list.
(03:27:51)<greg>i m going to go to the university to see my test results, see you later
(03:28:44)<TMC2>they aren't available online? :(
(03:29:41)<joe6pack>TMC2: well of course i knew it in a superficial way, i meant that i wasn't proficient in it
(03:29:56)<joe6pack>and it really helped me learn a lot about coding in c
(03:34:01)<TMC2>ok, well I claim to be proficient, and know nearly every (non C99) language feature
(03:34:35)<TMC2>(I'm pretty shocked by the number of extensions in C99)
(03:35:01)<TMC2>(draft C++0x is 10 times worse)
(03:35:25)<joe6pack>how could you be proficient if you havn't programmed anything non-trivial in it?
(03:36:39)<joe6pack>there's a ton of border case you'll never think about before encountaring some strange bug that was caused because of one
(03:36:55)<joe6pack>*there are a ton of border cases
(03:41:32)<TMC2>exactly, I'm a sham
(03:41:55)<TMC2>I hope to write an optimised bytecode interpreter in it sometime this year
(03:42:05)<TMC2>maybe that will give me credibility
(03:42:29)<joe6pack>of course in jobs interviews i'm always saying i'm highly proficient in exactly the technology/language they're looking for...
(03:42:47)<joe6pack>that sounds neat 
(03:44:03)<TMC2>it sucks to supposedly have been programming as a hobby for years and years yet have nothing presentable which is totally my own work
(03:44:22)<TMC2>ever heard of euphoria?
(03:44:56)<joe6pack>the emotion? 
(03:45:21)<joe6pack>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(gaming_software)
(03:45:24)<joe6pack>this one i guess?
(03:45:30)<joe6pack>never heard about it before today 
(03:45:38)<joe6pack>for what i can remember at least 
(03:45:41)<joe6pack>why?
(03:46:05)<Aerton>I think it was hyped in the upcoming star wars game
(03:46:13)<Aerton>and may be a couple of others
(03:46:50)<TMC2>no, the programming language
(03:47:12)<joe6pack>obviously we havn't 
(03:47:24)<TMC2>it's a neat language whose central gimmick is the sequence
(03:47:37)<TMC2>a data type which is basically the same thing as lisp's lists
(03:47:58)<joe6pack>ok
(03:48:02)<TMC2>(except euphoria doesn't follow code-is-data)
(03:49:43)<TMC2>I guess it's just a very easy, procedural list processing language
(03:55:01)<TMC2>eh.. what was the point?
(03:55:13)<TMC2>I'm creating a very similiar language
(03:55:40)<TMC2>so similar, it could probably be worth it to steal the interpreter for euphoria and rework it
(03:56:01)<oeb_werk>I heard about it in relation to gta4
(03:56:06)<joe6pack>just change the copyright in the header
(03:56:07)<TMC2>but reworking several 100kb of C code is probably hard tahn starting from scratch :'(
(03:56:15)<TMC2>harder than
(03:56:34)<TMC2>gta4??
(03:56:38)<TMC2>how/
(03:56:52)<oeb_werk>sorry, I was a bit behind in the chat log, I was speaking about the rendering engine
(03:56:57)<oeb_werk>Euphoria
(03:57:28)<oeb_werk>Note to sell, read entire message buffer before replying
(03:57:45)<oeb_werk>note to self, don't misspell self as sell.
(04:03:51)<TMC2>I see
(04:03:58)<TMC2>but I'm not interested in buying
(04:04:22)<TMC2>now... how to coax mysell into bed...
(04:05:32)<oeb_werk>Bed? What time zone are you in?
(04:05:45)<oeb_werk>I also find vodka is a great way to coax people into bed.
(04:05:47)<oeb_werk>=P
(04:05:53)<TMC2>all out :(
(04:06:15)<TMC2>it's 2am here at UT+12
(04:06:17)<TMC2>UTD?
(04:06:33)<TMC2>well, not sure what the current offset due to daylight savings is
(04:07:57)<oeb_werk>It's 3.15pm here in GMT
(04:09:52)<TMC2>yes, +12
(04:11:24)<oeb_werk>Where is that? New Zeland or somewhere?
(04:18:21)<TMC2>yes, as a whois will confirm
(04:20:13)<TMC2>that pixelate magazine looks
(04:20:15)<TMC2>great
(04:20:33)<TMC2>I've spotted some very very interesting articles in it
(04:20:45)<TMC2>wait a minute? didn't I say I was going to bed?
(04:20:51)<oeb_werk>I know, I was impressed by my brief flickthrough too.
(04:20:52)<TMC2>'night
(04:21:07)<oeb_werk>Don't go to bed! If I am gonna dodge work I need someone to talk too!
(04:21:17)<TMCGone>welllll
(04:21:20)<oeb_werk>=P
(04:21:53)<TMCGone>maybe not
(04:23:52)<oeb_werk>Hmmm, I need a better method for my random town than "Is there a building there already? No? Let's put one there"
(04:24:45)<oeb_werk>I also wonder could I make more interesting buildings by Getting a 2 rectagles and just intersecting them together. Would give me non-square houses.
(04:25:43)<Aerton>could be good for a townhall or other significant buildings, but not for every house
(04:26:44)<oeb_werk>Well this is more for villages than for towns.
(04:27:10)<Aerton>more often houses do not overlap, but are attached to one another
(04:27:13)<oeb_werk>I guess the other option would be to either take multiple stories into account (Which would be a pain) or make them bigger.
(04:27:34)<Aerton>like a pighouse and chicken hut to a big farm
(04:27:46)<TMC2>I think having all buildings orthogonally orientated is what really breaks the look of a really village
(04:27:49)<oeb_werk>My game is going to be mostly set in towns/villages/cities as opposed to dungeons.
(04:28:05)<TMC2>but that's pretty hard/impossible to fix in ascii
(04:28:15)<oeb_werk>That's true
(04:28:18)<TMC2>unless you could give them diagonal walls
(04:28:28)<TMC2>(that you can't walk/see through
(04:28:31)<oeb_werk>That would look crap in ascii I think.
(04:28:43)<TMC2>probably
(04:29:30)<oeb_werk>Ideally I would want the ability to have people up on the roofs who could fire at you and everything. I think that would just be too confusing though.
(04:29:49)<Aerton>circular design is quite common, but it would not fit well to a tiled game
(04:36:27)<oeb_werk>Actually, I now have an idea for a ruined town generator. Which might be pretty cool
(04:37:05)<oeb_werk>Would fit with my theme too
(04:45:20)<oeb_werk>Welcome back greg, how did you do?

(06:43:13)<purestrain>greetings
(06:44:34)<joe6pack>hello
(06:59:57)<deveah>can i mod a ps2 without voiding the warranty?
(07:00:47)<deveah>oh, magicswap thingie
(07:03:52)<Glowie>I highly doubt you can
(07:04:33)<deveah>it's a small thing you insert in the ps2, like a card
(07:08:45)<Glowie>I had a mod chip in my PS1
(07:16:08)<deveah>my parents refuse buying me a ps2, saying that modding is too "dangerous" , and I can lose my money
(07:19:28)<Glowie>Hehe
(07:23:04)<deveah>well, is it _that_ dangerous?
(07:23:11)<deveah>(risky) ?
(07:24:17)<Glowie>I don't think so if you do it right
(07:24:21)<Glowie>But if you don't..
(07:26:58)<deveah>the person who mods ps2 mods them from ~2005
(07:28:25)<Glowie>Should know his stuff then
(07:28:29)<Glowie>I don't think it's dangerous then
(07:31:54)<deveah>what could happen in the worst case?
(07:32:01)<deveah>would the warranty be voided?
(07:33:40)<Glowie>Warranty will most likely be voided even if you open the machine
(07:33:50)<Glowie>Worst case, I think the machine just breaks
(07:33:51)<deveah>:(
(07:33:55)<Glowie>But if he knows his stuff it should not happen
(07:34:38)<deveah>breaks? like what?
(07:35:07)<deveah>like KRANK! there goes my munny! ?
(07:37:04)<joe6pack>deveah: yes
(07:37:17)<joe6pack>but i know plenty of people that did that
(07:37:21)<joe6pack>and it never nroke
(07:37:25)<joe6pack>*broke
(07:37:47)<joe6pack>so you have to take the risk but it's not that big of a risk
(07:37:50)<joe6pack>ans anyway
(07:37:57)<joe6pack>ps2's are cheap these days
(07:38:06)<joe6pack>ps3's are expensive
(07:39:31)<deveah>i know
(07:39:44)<deveah>that's why I want to buy a ps2 and not a ps3

(03:44:38)<oeb_werk>It's not really bad though 1.4 or 1.6 ghz, 256 ram. It can run xp but not ubuntu.
(03:44:48)<oeb_werk>It's about 5 years old.#
(03:45:28)<oeb_werk>I also have a p90, but I cant remember why that's in storage.
(03:45:38)<oeb_werk>For all I know I may have fried it.
(03:46:23)<RotateMe>that's good enough, i will send you a version with lots of units doing lots of pathfinding once i'm finished with debugging and optimizations if that's okay with you
(04:02:46)<oeb_werk>That's fine
(04:58:14)<greg>oeb_werk: have you already done some stuff for your rl ?  ;)
(05:08:56)<oeb_werk>Not really, I spent last night reading through a book on c++ re-familiarising my self with OO stuff I have not delt with in a while.
(05:09:14)<oeb_werk>I am also attempting to work out a better town generator.
(05:09:33)<oeb_werk>I think one screen is too small for this, so I will need some kind of camera class for this.
(05:10:11)<oeb_werk>Does this work pretty much the same way as it does for tile games? As in I have a camera class which basicially holds the screen + a buffer
(05:14:22)<greg><oeb_werk> i am interested by town generation have you read some interesting tutorials
(05:17:23)<greg>well i don t understand your question very well
(05:23:17)<greg>do you plan to include scrolling in your rl ? if not, the making of a camera class is quite simple, it consist in 4 vars and 2 function to check the player position and to stay on the map.
(05:31:13)<oeb_werk>I will have scrolling
(05:31:28)<oeb_werk>I will probably need to use 4x the screen space I have now
(05:32:02)<oeb_werk>Or else of course there is the other option of treating it like levels. As in when you leave one screen you appear on the next. But it get's complicated that way too.
(05:32:45)<oeb_werk>I am going to want to deal with large towns later on and large amounts of enemies, I dont think a single 80x25 or whatever screen will be much good for that.
(05:33:21)<greg>ok it 's quite simple to deals with large maps
(05:34:29)<greg>you have 2 solution : the easy -> you move your cam screen by screen, following the player and checking the bounding of the map
(05:34:55)<greg>the hard -> move the camera pixel by pixel to have smooth scroll 
(05:35:02)<oeb_werk>I take it I just choose a range radiating out from the center, if the player moves into that range I just go if range + (Or - depending on the direction) 1+buffer from range to screen edge > map size (or < 1) then move the viewport
(05:35:19)<oeb_werk>I'll be using pdcurses, no pixels.
(05:36:07)<oeb_werk>There should be a not in there =P
(05:36:28)<greg>^^
(05:38:10)<oeb_werk>I am really trying to come up with a nicer village / town / city creator though. I think city will probably be the easiest, much more regular.
(05:38:24)<oeb_werk>Basicially create blocks, devide them into houses.
(05:39:39)<greg>this will produce american style cities ^^ 
(05:40:03)<oeb_werk>That's fine for the moment in this game
(05:40:52)<greg>yes it s really hard to produce a realistic random city
(05:41:04)<oeb_werk>The villages I am still wondering about.
(05:41:36)<oeb_werk>Maybe I should just pre-design twenty or thirty ascii buildings in different orientations and just place a few of them randomly.
(05:42:15)<greg>and do some street between buildings
(05:42:25)<oeb_werk>I could catagorise them, eg evey village starts with a centerpiece. This is either a road, a river, or something like a fountain or an inn.
(05:43:09)<oeb_werk>then it places 2 items from the services list (eg a blacksmith, a shop, that kinda thing)
(05:43:16)<oeb_werk>Then a number of houses too.
(05:44:02)<oeb_werk>I could do it totally proceduarally, but all those buildings would have different attributes, that could be a pain.
(05:44:32)<oeb_werk>Could then maybe use pathfinding to find the shortest path from a door do either the main road or any other path.
(05:44:46)<oeb_werk>That may produce something reasonably realistic.
(05:45:04)<greg>i think your way is the quickiest to build village 
(05:45:38)<oeb_werk>I should probably be starting all villages with a road too.
(05:46:46)<oeb_werk>I suppose for now I can just drop a sraight road through the middle, and focus on adding curves and stuff later
(05:47:54)<greg>yep or you can directly use some sin or cos function to draw curved road
(05:48:24)<oeb_werk>Through a 2D array?
(05:48:32)<greg>yeah 
(05:48:39)<greg>:)
(05:48:58)<oeb_werk>Haa haa, let me get started a bit at a time, not done any maths other than the real basics in a very long time.
(05:49:24)<greg>^^ 
(05:49:47)<oeb_werk>Also, roads are curved for a reason, I would have to look at dropping trees or rocks into the curves too.
(05:50:13)<greg>or houses :p
(05:50:42)<oeb_werk>Houses get built by roads, not normally the other way around
(05:51:03)<oeb_werk>As in a house would not be built in the middle of nowhere and have a road aimed right at it
(05:51:12)<greg>ok ^^
(05:51:34)<oeb_werk>I think, I don't really know much about infrastructure planning.
(05:52:41)<greg>and so do i, i am focusing on land making and cavern maze making for the moment
(05:53:50)<oeb_werk>My game will be almost exclusivly set in towns rather than dungeons
(05:54:57)<oeb_werk>right, I'm off home. Back on line in 10 or 15 min
(05:55:07)<greg>ok see ya
(05:55:08)<RotateMe>binary heaps for a* is a hell of a cool thing :D
(06:06:04)<RotateMe>hm is there a good for { ... } loop that addresses the 8 fields around another field?
(06:06:37)<RotateMe>i didn't realize how often you need that in rls until now
(06:07:55)<Glowie>I just use for(int i=-1; i<2; i++) for(int ii=-1; ii<2; ii++) something;
(06:08:52)<Glowie>Should work very well especially if you use two dimensional map, like map[x+i][y+ii].tile = '#';
(06:12:12)<RotateMe>that's perfect, thanks
(06:16:19)<deveah>greg, are you developing a rl?
(06:19:34)<Kadwiell>To be unnecessarily pedantic: you should remember to add "if(i || ii)" if you just want the 8 border cells and not the center cell..
(06:19:35)<greg>yes
(06:19:52)<greg>i have already make some game engine and demo
(06:20:38)<greg>but i have some troubles to draw tiles and so, that s why i am trying to do a rl :)
(06:21:57)<Glowie>Kadwiell: I prefer if(i == 0 && ii == 0) continue; :P
(06:22:32)<greg><Glowie> and watch out boundary of you map ;)
(06:22:49)<greg>:p
(06:22:50)<deveah>yes, that happened to me before
(06:23:13)<Glowie>Naturally, though in my case my out most tiles are always walls, so there won't be that kind of checks pretty much ever
(06:23:15)<deveah>on my los code, precalculated los was stored in an array
(06:23:19)<Kadwiell>I just think if(i || ii) is charmingly cryptic :)
(06:23:54)<Glowie>True, it has some mystery to it :P
(06:24:17)<deveah>and scrolling made los give negative array indexes
(06:24:22)<deveah>and crached my game
(06:24:48)<deveah>*crashed
(06:24:54)<greg>:)
(06:25:40)<deveah>but now I only use the los function where I find a wall
(06:26:02)<deveah>and I also gave up using scrolling
(06:26:44)<deveah>because absolute positions were screwed too
(06:26:48)<greg>:o scrolling is great, dont give up  
(06:27:13)<deveah>for example, monster_absolute_x = monster_onscreen_x + camera_offset_x :(
(06:27:17)<greg>you have to build a cam class
(06:27:33)<deveah>i like rls made in one single file
(06:27:42)<Glowie>80x25 is enough for a traditional roguelike
(06:27:51)<Glowie>You like wrong things
(06:28:21)<deveah>NanoRL used 40x25 and worked awesomely!
(06:28:23)<greg>argh your way to calculate monster position are horrible
(06:28:32)<greg>is sorry
(06:28:48)<deveah>yes, monster_x should be monster_absolute_x
(06:29:16)<deveah>and the monster's onscreen position monster_x + camera_offset_x
(06:29:38)<deveah>changing camera offsets each time the player goes out of the "safe area"
(06:29:50)<greg>monster on screnn= montster absolute- cam position
(06:30:20)<deveah>-, yes
(06:30:33)<greg>you want my cam function ? 
(06:30:35)<greg>:)
(06:31:18)<deveah>no thanks :)
(06:31:19)<greg>but it is for pixel by pixel scrolliing
(06:31:43)<deveah>battle squadron ftw!
(06:32:22)<deveah>np: reed - battle squadron (original by ron klaren)
(06:35:13)<RotateMe>thx for the tips again greg, Glowie and Kawdiell
(06:35:20)<deveah>i should go play more Morrowind
(06:35:20)<Glowie>No problem
(06:35:30)<RotateMe>i in fact forgot to check my map borders ^^
(06:35:46)<RotateMe>i always do it because i find it frustratingly complicated
(06:36:10)<RotateMe>urgh not complicated, i meant annoying
(06:36:39)<greg>http://www.megaupload.com/?d=O4T0AHYJ
(06:37:51)<greg>;)
(06:41:24)<Kadwiell>If you're using OO you could make all those checks in a centralized map class - so e.g. get*(-1,-1) would return the properties of an indestructible, impassable, invisible wall
(06:41:38)<Kadwiell>Might make the code a bit less annoying to read and write
(06:42:49)<purestrain>wohooo... oo discussion ?
(06:49:16)<RotateMe>kind of
(06:50:24)<RotateMe>since this was my first oo project, map access is directly in most cases, but i guess i will create a method for this now
(06:50:44)<RotateMe>it was like myMap->fields[x][y].blocks
(06:50:53)<RotateMe>which sucks, i know ;D
(06:51:05)<purestrain>why ?
(06:51:14)<RotateMe>because of stuff like that
(06:51:23)<RotateMe>oh you just joined
(06:51:29)<RotateMe>accessing tiles that are not on the map
(06:52:28)<purestrain>ah, you're just talking about a method around the 'real' access ?
(06:52:34)<RotateMe>yep
(06:52:50)<RotateMe>i did this for most stuff but not for the map access
(06:53:00)<RotateMe>where it would have made most sense ^^
(06:55:29)<RotateMe>god dammit now i get strange compiler error where it says it can't find definitions of #defines i do in an included header file
(06:55:36)<greg> making method to acces  map is a waste of time  :p
(06:55:48)<greg>arf lunch time
(06:55:52)<RotateMe>:D
(06:55:56)<greg>see ya 
(06:56:12)<RotateMe>well i saved some time just right now
(06:56:18)<greg[miam]>^^
(07:27:00)<joe6pack>RotateMe: do you get linking errors?
(07:27:10)<joe6pack>oh wait
(07:27:33)<joe6pack>i think you need to either give it the path to the include (-I for gcc)
(07:27:47)<joe6pack>or the for the libs (-l)
(07:33:47)<deveah>"Gamer_2k4 is the screen name of Jared Brayshaw, who is currently working on the Labyrinth of Reptoran. He is an avid programmer, and is studying software engineering at the Milwaukee School of Engineering. He frequently posts to r.g.r.d. To his knowledge, he is the youngest person to complete a 7DRL. (18 years, 68 days)" i beat him!!!1!111
(07:34:14)<joe6pack>not if he doesn't know it!
(07:34:29)<joe6pack>otherwise he is still the youngest to his knowledge 
(07:34:55)<joe6pack>also
(07:35:18)<joe6pack>18 is not that excessively young
(07:40:27)<purestrain>i've started code::blocks ! yay!
(07:51:21)<RotateMe>where is that quote from?
(07:51:37)<RotateMe>purestrain, it's a nice ide except a few nasty bugs
(07:52:04)<RotateMe>eg when you shut down programs in an uncommon way you have to restart code::blocks in order to start it again
(07:52:26)<RotateMe>joe6pack: no linking errors, it worked all the time up to now
(07:52:44)<RotateMe>i added a class definition in the file with the #define's
(07:53:57)<joe6pack>beats me
(07:54:01)<joe6pack>no idea why
(07:54:46)<RotateMe>found it, the include was nested again :(
(07:55:24)<RotateMe>hmmm i need to define an attribute in a header file which is a struct
(07:55:31)<RotateMe>this struct is defined in another file
(07:55:52)<RotateMe>is there anyway of using it without including the other header file?
(07:56:32)<joe6pack>why don't you want to include the other file?
(07:57:04)<joe6pack>your sturct should be defined in a headre, and that header included in every file that uses the struct 
(08:00:00)<RotateMe>gah that's so much effort ;)
(08:26:17)<RotateMe>i can't compare structs in friggin c++!?
(08:26:18)<RotateMe>:(
(08:27:09)<Glowie>if(struct == struct)?
(08:28:13)<RotateMe>doesn't seem to work
(08:28:30)<RotateMe>it works if i compare every single element, but not if i compare them completely
(08:28:32)<Glowie>Of course it doesn't
(08:28:36)<Glowie>It's C++, d'oh
(08:29:06)<Glowie>1. Use classes. 2. Overload the == operator to use it on objects inside an if
(08:29:28)<Glowie>C++ isn't supposed to be a user friendly high level language :P
(08:30:17)<RotateMe>i won't use a damn class for coordinates ... this doesn't seem... appropriate ^^
(08:30:21)<jraregris>I'm a java boy. What are struct-s?
(08:30:54)<Glowie>Comparable to classes in Java
(08:31:00)<purestrain>afaik are you able to overload == for structs
(08:31:04)<Glowie>Different kind of member visibility
(08:31:10)<Glowie>Oh
(08:31:25)<Glowie>But in C++ you really should use classes instead of structs most of the time
(08:31:44)<purestrain>inline bool operator==(struct& a, struct& b) { .... }
(08:31:50)<jraregris>how does the member visibility differ?
(08:31:59)<Glowie>It's public by default in structs
(08:32:12)<Glowie>I don't know Java, but in Cpp classes have private by default
(08:32:16)<jraregris>sounds cumbersome
(08:32:23)<Glowie>:o
(08:32:24)<Glowie>How come
(08:33:04)<jraregris>why not use just one thing, and set member visibilty on a `per member basis' as in java?
(08:33:18)<Glowie>Oh, you can do that
(08:33:19)<jraregris>(I'm asking because i want to know)
(08:33:30)<purestrain>because you have to remain backwards compatibility for c ?
(08:33:38)<jraregris>ouch
(08:33:58)<Glowie>It's just kind of a tradition to have structs public
(08:34:44)<purestrain>tradition? i always thought it is because you are able to compile c code with a cpp compiler
(08:35:40)<Glowie>That too of course
(08:35:47)<Glowie>But in C++ it doesn't make a difference
(08:35:53)<Glowie>You probably know better anyway
(08:36:12)<jraregris>a quick look at the wikipedia might have explained it a bit
(08:37:14)<jraregris>it's more like an advanced variable than a class
(08:37:31)<Glowie>In C at least, yeah
(08:37:52)<Glowie>In C++ it's like a class with default visibility public
(08:38:38)<jomiolto>oh? that's cool
(08:38:42)<purestrain>x86 ?
(08:38:44)<Glowie>Yup
(08:38:48)<jraregris>neat
(08:38:55)<jomiolto>asm is lovely, but sadly it's not really useful for many things :(
(08:38:58)<jraregris>then you can really optimise your RL!!
(08:39:27)<purestrain>i used it for dsp processing and fast blitting routines back in 1996
(08:39:45)<jraregris>this is pretty neat: http://www.byte.com/abrash/ 
(08:39:51)<purestrain>and it was... fast compared to turbo pascals 'bgi' output
(08:40:13)<Glowie>Mostly just out of curiosity, I'm not going to use it ever I think. Maybe some hardware level stuff, trying to fool the input with interrupts or something. At the same time I learn how high level languages work under the hood
(08:40:33)<Glowie>Hehe purestrain
(08:40:50)<Glowie>You wrote directly to video memory?
(08:41:24)<jomiolto>write some os independent code, that's a nice change to all the massive development environments with bazillion functions/classes/etc. :)
(08:41:49)<jomiolto>doing it all by yourself can be very refreshing for a change
(08:42:06)<Glowie>Not just very convenient, and that's something I like :P
(08:42:53)<jomiolto>it's more convenient actually, you only need to know the assembler and a bit about the hardware you're running on, no need to learn huge libraries or anything like that :P
(08:43:31)<Glowie>Convenient for making games, I think not :P
(08:44:05)<jomiolto>well, not if you actually want to get something done, but if you just want to tinker with something "simple"...
(08:44:28)<jomiolto>but I guess most people actually prefer to make things that are useful to more than themselves
(08:44:52)<Glowie>I prefer getting things done, I've seen too many programmers who never get to the release stage because they strive for perfect OOP etc.
(08:45:38)<jomiolto>that's what often happens to me too :(
(08:45:41)<Glowie>Hehe
(08:46:02)<jomiolto>not with asm, though, because I'm not even planning on releasing those ;)
(08:46:04)<Glowie>Quick & dirty > perfect OOP if it's the way to get things done
(08:46:12)<Glowie>:P
(08:46:23)<jomiolto>yes, actually having something that works is infinitely better than having just a nice plan
(08:47:00)<Glowie>Asm could be interesting for some very low level stuff though, like feeding the mouse simulated clicks to create a bot or something
(08:47:13)<jraregris>I just made up my mind to set full steam for a small (coffee break, perhaps) RL to get things going.
(08:47:25)<Glowie>Good luck then :P
(08:47:57)<jraregris>Yeah... It's a lot smarter than aiming for the perfect OOP and personal holy grails.
(08:48:33)<jomiolto>I've been mostly tinkering with fov code for at least a week, and I didn't actually get anything useful done (although, at least now I understand shadow casting quite intimately...)
(08:49:20)<Glowie>When I first started, I just ripped someone else's fov code to get things going, only two years later I understood the basic idea behind the algorithm :P
(08:49:38)<jomiolto>heh
(08:49:57)<jraregris>yeah, I guess my RL will contain lots of roguebasin, at least temporarily
(08:50:03)<jomiolto>that's pretty close to what I did a long time ago, but lately I've really enjoyed looking at things from the mathematical point of view
(08:50:16)<RotateMe>dammit just read your comment that you CAN overload the == for structs
(08:50:23)<RotateMe>replaced all structs with classes now
(08:50:26)<Glowie>Haha
(08:50:29)<Glowie>But that's not a big deal
(08:50:33)<jomiolto>I guess it was finally understanding the specifics of Bresenham's algorithms that got me so interested in maths
(08:50:38)<RotateMe>well now i've got better oo ^^
(08:50:39)<Glowie>Just add public: in the beginning of the class and it's a struct
(08:51:08)<Glowie>Actually that's what got me into maths based algorithms too, jomiolto
(08:51:11)<Glowie>Bresenham's
(08:51:23)<Glowie>Understanding them, that is
(08:51:28)<RotateMe>bresenhams line drawing?
(08:51:32)<Glowie>Yep
(08:51:35)<jomiolto>yeah, it's actually surprising how simple the whole thing is, when you just think of it from the right point of view
(08:51:41)<Glowie>Though trying to understand something like A* is a bit more difficult
(08:51:50)<Glowie>Yeah
(08:51:53)<RotateMe>A* and Binary Heaps is what gets me into math right now
(08:51:55)<jomiolto>(I never really read anything that described the algorithm, but rather came up with the theory by myself)
(08:52:01)<RotateMe>and i am actally going to study maths
(08:52:28)<Glowie>Dijkstra (spelling?) is a lot simpler
(08:52:37)<RotateMe>what's that?
(08:52:42)<RotateMe>simpler pathfinding?
(08:52:45)<Glowie>A pathfinding algorithm too
(08:52:48)<RotateMe>k
(08:52:53)<RotateMe>no i needed really fast stuff
(08:52:53)<Glowie>Slower I think
(08:52:57)<Glowie>Or something
(08:52:58)<RotateMe>real time and lots of units
(08:53:10)<RotateMe>that's why i had to add a new container class in cpp
(08:53:20)<purestrain>dij* is the same as a* without heuristic
(08:53:27)<Glowie>Yep
(08:53:30)<RotateMe>ah, okay
(08:53:42)<RotateMe>well my heuristic is just manhatten (x dist + y dist)
(08:53:55)<RotateMe>that's faster and i don't care about non-optimal ways
(08:54:07)<RotateMe>calculating a square root would take waaaayyy too much time :D
(08:54:32)<RotateMe>*my heuristic costs
(08:55:01)<Kadwiell>Heh.. but you allow diagonal movement?
(08:55:10)<RotateMe>yep
(08:55:22)<RotateMe>that's why it gives you non optimal ways
(08:55:44)<RotateMe>the heuristic estimation is often bigger than the actual shortest way but that's not so notable in most cases
(08:56:09)<Glowie>Who knows C trivia well? Can a struct hold a function pointer?
(08:56:13)<RotateMe>i might add the option to do the square root based calculation but that would mean another boolean comparison ^^
(08:56:19)<Kadwiell>Yep.. I don't think sqrt is likely to be a bottleneck, though :)
(08:56:26)<RotateMe>Glowie: yes
(08:56:33)<RotateMe>it is
(08:56:35)<Glowie>Okay
(08:56:36)<Kadwiell>Why wouldn't it? Isn't a function pointer just a normal pointer?
(08:56:40)<RotateMe>yep
(08:56:56)<Kadwiell>With intricate, hard-to-remember syntax, admittedly
(08:57:04)<jomiolto>functions aren't allowed to return function pointers, that's the only restriction I know of
(08:57:22)<Kadwiell>Huh, didn't know that
(08:58:03)<RotateMe>ugh then it's likely that they can't go into structs, sry Glowie, i might have been wrong
(08:58:08)<jomiolto>I think it stems from the fact that in some legacy (and who knows modern too) systems function pointers could be of different size than regular data poniters, and as such returning them from functions doesn't really work as simply as for normal pointers
(08:58:17)<Glowie>Wrong jomiolto?
(08:58:19)<RotateMe>Kawdiell: square root calculation might well be the bottleneck
(08:58:24)<Glowie>http://www.newty.de/fpt/fpt.html#r_value
(08:58:41)<Kadwiell>RotateMe: I think not, in roguelike pathfinding
(08:59:07)<Kadwiell>It was probably true once for very math-intensive things, like graphics etc.
(08:59:13)<jomiolto>Glowie: interesting, I don't think that's allowed by the standard, though
(08:59:21)<Glowie>Wouldn't know that well
(08:59:32)<RotateMe>I think it's about five comparisons and five assignments and two calculations (+) per knot
(08:59:41)<jomiolto>of course most modern compilers probably have no problem actually doing it, but I'm quite sure than even in C99 it's still not strictly allowed
(08:59:56)<jomiolto>-than
(09:00:03)<RotateMe>one single square root calculation would take more time than any of this
(09:01:16)<purestrain>even on a 150mhz gp2x i used sqrt; well, integer squareroot, but it was not the bottleneck
(09:01:25)<purestrain>and the game was realtime
(09:01:36)<Kadwiell>Hm, comp.lang.c seems to say that functions can return function pointers
(09:02:11)<Kadwiell>From the answer to 1.22 in the FAQ
(09:02:18)<RotateMe>purestrain: it was sqrt in an a* algo?
(09:02:23)<jomiolto>hmm, yes, I think I'm mistaken
(09:02:45)<jomiolto>the problem isn't with returning function pointers, but rather casting them to normal pointers
(09:02:46)<purestrain>yes; how often do you need to find a new path ?
(09:02:48)<jomiolto>sorry :(
(09:03:21)<Glowie>No problem :P
(09:03:27)<RotateMe>purestrain, pretty often...
(09:03:32)<Glowie>I doubt anyone would ever need that anymore anyway
(09:03:41)<jomiolto>"the C99 standard leaves casting from "void *" to a function pointer undefined."
(09:03:42)<purestrain>pretty often?
(09:04:11)<Kadwiell>RotateMe: You should try to run your program under a profiler to get some numbers on this.. I would be very surprised if you found that sqrt actually would be the bottleneck if you put it in
(09:04:13)<RotateMe>hmm i just thought about it
(09:04:17)<RotateMe>maybe not that often
(09:04:23)<RotateMe>i'll have a look into it
(09:04:49)<RotateMe>hmmm i don't really know what you guys think is the most time taking step of the algorythm
(09:05:09)<purestrain>but; why do you need a squareroot? wouldn't just the squared values be enough ?
(09:05:44)<RotateMe>not really, what would you take as the g-costs then?
(09:07:57)<purestrain>iirc are the g costs only the actual costs from origin to the current node ?
(09:10:28)<jraregris>what does the * do? (or what does it mean)
(09:10:39)<Kadwiell>I think d^2 overestimates long distances, as explained here: http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html#S11
(09:12:01)<Kadwiell>* means "pointer" (in this context, anyway, if you meant void *)
(09:12:22)<jraregris>yeah
(09:12:37)<jraregris>my guess, actually.
(09:12:49)<RotateMe>purestrain: but the g-costs have to be in relation to the h-costs otherwise results will be likewise bad i think
(09:15:22)<purestrain>huh? why should they be in relation? o_O perhaps i'm thinking wrong...
(09:15:44)<Kadwiell>I haven't really thought this through deeply, but doesn't it make sense?
(09:15:58)<purestrain>but as for me, g could be anything, if you are moving over swamp, it could be 30, if you're moving over plains, it oculd be one
(09:16:28)<RotateMe>relation might be the wrong word but if you add 1 for every field you moved away from the start point, but add the squared costs of the distance to the target the results are wrong
(09:16:56)<RotateMe>purestrain: yes that's right, but the h costs take an average of those costs, in your example 15 * distance
(09:17:03)<Kadwiell>If we let distances approach infinity and h grows with the square of the distance, it makes sense that it ends up being the only thing considered..
(09:17:07)<purestrain>huh ?
(09:17:23)<purestrain>i'd never taken an average costs
(09:17:46)<RotateMe>just distance or what?
(09:18:10)<purestrain>perhaps i completely misunderstood the true concepts behind a* ;-)
(09:18:25)<RotateMe>g-costs and h-costs have the same worth in order to see if a knot is better than other knots
(09:19:27)<RotateMe>so if you just add one to g, but a squared value to the h-costs you end up with taking wrong knots as the best
(09:19:34)<Kadwiell>The multiplier for movement cost doesn't really matter here, as x^2 > Mx when x -> inf no matter what M is
(09:19:35)<RotateMe>which brings non optimal ways
(09:19:42)<purestrain>why ?
(09:20:13)<RotateMe>because taken distance is as important as distance to be taken
(09:21:12)<RotateMe>Kawdiell: the multiplier doesn't matter in that case but i'm saying that you SHOULDN'T use the x^2 <> Mx comparison
(09:21:38)<Kadwiell>You shouldn't use it in A*? Right, that's what I'm saying too
(09:21:44)<purestrain>rotateme, even so; it's just a heuristic
(09:22:00)<Kadwiell>Or are you saying that the math doesn't apply?
(09:22:11)<RotateMe>no, no, not use it in A*
(09:22:27)<RotateMe>purestrain, yes it is heuristic, but the better the estimation the better the results
(09:23:11)<RotateMe>and i don't think that taking the powered distances added and unsquared as the h-costs is not really better than using the manhatten way
(09:23:28)<purestrain>but even if i think more about it... i don't get the point
(09:24:13)<RotateMe>the point using manhatten?
(09:24:39)<RotateMe>or taking the squareroot distance as the h-costs?
(09:26:53)<Kadwiell>Oops, I think we've been overthinking this
(09:27:04)<Kadwiell>The appropriate heuristic isn't actually Euclidean
(09:27:22)<Kadwiell>But max(abs(dx),abs(dy))
(09:27:55)<RotateMe>oh... that sounds good
(09:27:59)<RotateMe>:D
(09:28:11)<RotateMe>where did you read this?
(09:28:13)<Kadwiell>I think this is because the costs for moving diagonally are "wrong" (i.e. not sqrt(2))
(09:28:26)<Kadwiell>One screen up from the link I pasted above
(09:28:31)<RotateMe>ah okay
(09:28:44)<RotateMe>yeah that's why i don't use euclidian
(09:28:48)<Kadwiell>E.g. f you want to move 10 north, 20 east, you move 10 northeast, then 10 east
(09:28:52)<Kadwiell>If*
(09:29:17)<RotateMe>ah okay that's right, makes perfect sense :D
(09:29:20)<RotateMe>thanks
(09:31:12)<purestrain>hmmm....
(09:32:02)<purestrain>afair my units always took the best path
(09:32:10)<purestrain>i should reimplement a* with d
(09:47:41)<purestrain>my brain is bumping... i'm thinking and thinking
(09:58:08)<purestrain>maybe i've already thought about it, and thats the reason why i used a integer square root :-)
(10:00:04)<RotateMe>the h-costs are meant to be nothing else then a good estimation of the steps you have to go to reach the target, BUT they should never be bigger than the actual way that you need to go there
(10:00:22)<RotateMe>MAX(dx,dy) is just the shortest way, with which you can't be wrong
(10:01:07)<RotateMe>if you would use the euclidian distance, you would assume that moving diagonally is more expensive than moving straight, which it isn't in most RLs
(10:01:20)<purestrain>but it is in mine
(10:04:01)<jraregris>neat
(10:05:32)<RotateMe>ah okay than the euclidian way is just right
(10:05:56)<RotateMe>wow that's awesome, you really need to watch my broken pathfinding :D
(10:06:05)<RotateMe>i'm going to make a youtube video
(10:06:43)<RotateMe>hmm that's strange it won't work anymore :(
(10:28:02)<jraregris>Flukes are fun
(10:59:28)<RotateMe>uhm... abs() in c++ returns the absolute of a number doesn't it?
(11:04:07)<RotateMe>ah now it works
(11:04:26)<RotateMe>hmm can i still access attributes of my objects in the destructor?

(11:06:03)<RotateMe>why can a boolean have the value 254? (shown in the debugger)
(11:08:02)<rnv>invalid memory
(11:13:19)<Kadwiell>You can still access your object's attributes, you'll generally have to do so for any nontrivial destructor (e.g. "delete ptr;")
(11:14:09)<RotateMe>yep i thought i would have had invalid data in my constructor but the problem is elsewhere
(11:14:59)<RotateMe>are there problems when calling the delete this; statement from within the constructor?
(11:16:17)<Kadwiell>Uh, the destructor, or the constructor?
(11:17:51)<Kadwiell>Wait, misthought a bit there.. but you want to construct an object and then immediately delete it?
(11:18:38)<Kadwiell>The general thing to remember with "delete this" is that it'll fail if you did not allocate your object with "new"
(11:19:23)<RotateMe>hmm
(11:19:32)<RotateMe>then this might be the error
(11:20:02)<RotateMe>in my constructor i check whether knots are at a valid place, if they are not, i call delete this; return;
(11:20:23)<RotateMe>i'll try just return; and delete them from outside
(11:21:29)<Kadwiell>Sounds like a case for exceptions, perhaps?
(11:23:30)<RotateMe>yes, this would be more elegant i guess
(11:23:51)<RotateMe>but since i want to see results and don't know how exceptions work, i'll just try it like this ^^
(11:24:40)<RotateMe>didn't change anything :(
(11:25:15)<Kadwiell>What sorts of errors do you get?
(11:25:50)<RotateMe>I have the usual openList and references to knots on the map
(11:26:20)<RotateMe>the openList works well but references on the map get broken once they are double checked
(11:26:41)<RotateMe>which results in multiple knots created on the same spot on the map
(11:27:00)<RotateMe>which, again results in a neverending loop most of the times
(11:27:25)<Kadwiell>"Broken" as in corrupted memory?
(11:27:54)<RotateMe>that's what i'm trying to find out
(11:28:26)<RotateMe>strange thing is that there's no crash in debug mode but in normal execution in crashes pretty much the moment it starts pathfinding
(11:28:44)<RotateMe>at the moment i'm too tired to see what's going on, even though i've visualized the pathfinding with three colors and two different symbols ^^
(11:29:15)<Kadwiell>Hmm, strange.. I think perhaps some sorts of debug modes set up memory in a different way
(11:29:18)<RotateMe>i just see that there are knots in my openList and closedList that are no longer referenced to from the map
(11:29:27)<Kadwiell>So some undefined behaviour ends up behaving in different ways
(11:29:39)<RotateMe>yep that's the problem with code::blocks
(11:30:02)<RotateMe>most of the times though it crashes while in debug mode but works when in normal execution ^^
(11:30:33)<RotateMe>well i'll get some sleep, thanks for the help so far, see you

(01:10:22)<oeb_werk>Housecleaning is fun, just deleted 100 rows off a table that had gotten way outa hand
(01:56:00)<greg_>oeb_werk ---> http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_perlin.htm ;) to generate random land or random cavern
(01:58:47)<RotateMe>the last spheres with wood textures look awesome
(01:59:16)<RotateMe>perlin noise is used in some roguelikes already, like dwarf fortress or chronicles of doryen
(02:00:15)<TMCSleeps>yeah, I noticed perlin noise routines in the doryen library
(02:03:57)<greg_>yes it produce great cavern when combined with a floodfillalgo and reaslistic continent for world map 
(02:33:23)<oeb_werk>I saw an article somewhere on using perlin noise to generate a cavern using it

(11:02:59)<oeb_werk>Ho hum, no girlfriend for two weeks. I wonder will I actually get some coding done.
(11:14:27)<jraregris>oeb_werk: contragts
(11:20:40)<oeb_werk>Congrats for what? The peice and quiet?
(11:21:43)<oeb_werk>She is off swanning around NY for two weeks, the lucky fecker.
(11:21:51)<oeb_werk>I get to sit in Ireland, in the rain.
(11:27:20)<TMCSleep>in front of a computer
(11:27:23)<TMCSleep>and your code!
(11:27:42)<TMCSleep>what could be better? *nudge* *nudge*
(11:31:56)<oeb_werk>Gonna try and get some more done tonight anyway after my kid goes to bed
(11:32:39)<jraregris>Contrats on the potential time to get to code. Even though you'd much rather be with your girlfriend, I don't know of any freetime coder who think they have too much time to code.
(11:33:04)<TMCSleep>that's easy
(11:33:33)<TMCSleep>during the holidays I have too much time, so I waste it
(11:34:10)<oeb_werk>See the GF lives 30 odd miles away, so I can't normally code when I am in her place. When I am not at hers I have my kid, and he is two so I don't get much chance to work when he is awake.
(11:34:33)<TMCSleep>I'm generally less productive when I have every day free than with only 2 or 3 hours
(11:35:38)<oeb_werk>I agree with you there too. My kids mom is taking him away for the bank holiday on monday. My girlfriend will be in new york, and I'm not working. I am willing to bet, that because I have an entire day to myself for the first time in two years that I will not do a tap =P
(11:36:01)<oeb_werk>That's actually scary. First day to myself in two years =/
(11:36:37)<jraregris>heh, I've set up an SVN with an eclipse project, so I can code even when I've only got my girlfriend or even my parents computer.
(11:36:51)<oeb_werk>My gf has no net connection.
(11:37:11)<oeb_werk>Speaking of SVN, I am hearing alot of great stuff about GIT recently
(11:38:12)<jraregris>actually at my girlfriends parents there's no internet, but if you jam a laptop up under the ceiling in the kitchen, you can hog the neighbors wireless just enough to do a check out.
(11:38:27)<oeb_werk>haa haa
(11:38:47)<jraregris>oeb_werk: yeah. main reason I'm using svn is that it's widespread, and that I've got a free hosting on it.
(11:40:21)<oeb_werk>never used either one
(11:40:40)<oeb_werk>Used cvs years ago, last time I worked on a big dev team, but no need since
(03:05:35)<RotateMe>:(
(03:05:53)<RotateMe>my pathfinding is horribly slow even though i used every trick i could think of
(03:06:15)<RotateMe>i visualized it and it really does it the optimal way but still it's slow
(03:07:00)<RotateMe>i did look into the code more deeply and realized how much code is involved when you create or delete objects, so might it be a (VERY) bad idea to use objects to represent knots?
(03:07:28)<TMCSleep>what's a knot?
(03:07:29)<deveah>just got Diablo 2 - is it good?
(03:07:41)<TMCSleep>I've been wondering all afternoon
(03:16:44)<RotateMe>everything with my pathfinding implementation seemed to work well until i tested it on 20 units (which is actually way less then i will have in the finished game)
(03:17:03)<RotateMe>at the moment i saw the framerate drop to 20 i wanted to smash the keyboard agains my monitor :D
(03:17:13)<RotateMe>waypoints: yep
(03:17:43)<RotateMe>i know pretty much what the map will look like, so i set subgoals along the ways units will want to take
(03:18:04)<RotateMe>i guess i'll precalculate pathes between waypoints before the game starts
(03:18:18)<RotateMe>but anyway, the whole work was wasted
(03:18:35)<TMCSleep>so, you had 20 units each doing pathfinding towards the player every step?
(03:19:03)<RotateMe>nope only every 40 steps when they reached a waypoint
(03:19:39)<TMCSleep>:( wow
(03:19:43)<TMCSleep>(is this realtime?)
(03:20:02)<RotateMe>and i even made it so that only a few units can calculate a path per turn so that the game needs continouus resources
(03:20:05)<RotateMe>yep it's realtime
(03:20:44)<TMCSleep>now I'm confused - how long is a turn? one frame?
(03:20:53)<RotateMe>i thought of a lot of stuff, and debugging through the pathfinding stuff prooved that it works pretty fast, but debugging deeper showed how much messed up code is needed to create an object
(03:21:25)<RotateMe>one turn is just defined with 60 frames
(03:21:39)<RotateMe>every unit needs some frames (mostly about 20) to take one step
(03:21:59)<RotateMe>framerate is at about 67 fps
(03:22:51)<RotateMe>i think with 20 unit doing 1 pathfind every 40 steps (which means about every 13 seconds) i'm not asking too much do i?
(03:23:43)<RotateMe>another solution might be to create the nodes before starting the game and just changing their values
(03:24:06)<TMCSleep>sounds extremely reasonable
(03:24:08)<RotateMe>(like bool isUsed or bool isInOpenList)
(03:24:32)<RotateMe>problem is i can't be sure this'll fix it
(03:24:49)<TMCSleep>can't you reduce that amount of unintended object creation code?
(03:24:52)<RotateMe>are there tools to test what sections of code take most time/resources?
(03:25:09)<TMCSleep>where is it? in shuffling around stuff in your heap(s)?
(03:25:21)<TMCSleep>yes, profilers
(03:25:33)<RotateMe>k i'll have a look at them
(03:25:40)<RotateMe>what do you mean, where is it?
(03:25:43)<RotateMe>the object creation?
(03:26:06)<TMCSleep>well, whatever's being unreasonably slow
(03:26:22)<RotateMe>ah, well that's what i'm trying to find out
(03:26:33)<TMCSleep>you know, this is hard to remember: but you really should always profile before doing serious optimisation
(03:26:57)<TMCSleep>but no matter how well you know your code, you will probably be amazed at where it's actually taking its time
(03:27:02)<TMCSleep>*because no matter
(03:27:14)<RotateMe>do you know whether code::blocks has a profiler built in?
(03:27:23)<TMCSleep>it uses gcc, right?
(03:27:30)<TMCSleep>gcc comes with gprof
(03:27:40)<RotateMe>okay
(03:27:52)<TMCSleep>you need to compile with a switch
(03:28:11)<RotateMe>ah okay
(03:28:19)<RotateMe>and how can i look into the results?
(03:29:04)<TMCSleep>look for the gprof manual (but don't read it too closely, most of it isn't helpful)
(03:29:16)<TMCSleep>ok, you compile with -g -pg
(03:29:22)<TMCSleep>then you run the program
(03:29:40)<TMCSleep>which generates a file, gmon.out
(03:29:53)<TMCSleep>you then run gprof on it to create a report
(03:30:14)<TMCSleep>there's two main reports it produces:
(03:30:35)<TMCSleep>one lists time spent per function, the other time spent per line of code
(03:31:32)<TMCSleep>gprof doesn't seem like the best profiler to me, but it's pretty quick to use
(03:32:19)<TMCSleep>(oh, I forgot that gprof can also do code block execution counting. That's not available in freebasic, where I've been using gprof)
(03:33:11)<TMCSleep>I don't know how well it works with C++ either; I've never tried
(03:37:14)<RotateMe>looking in the task manager proofs something is wrong: 50% cpu usage
(03:37:24)<RotateMe>since i have a dual core this is pretty bad :D
(03:37:34)<RotateMe>hmmm where did my gprof.out go?
(03:37:38)<TMCSleep>while playing?
(03:37:44)<TMCSleep>no idea :P
(03:37:45)<RotateMe>game directory or compiler directory?
(03:37:50)<RotateMe>yep while playing
(03:38:04)<TMCSleep>must be game directoru
(03:38:29)<TMCSleep>be warned that gcc/gprof doesn't pick up all the time spent in the program
(03:38:36)<TMCSleep>library functions might be ignored
(03:39:23)<TMCSleep>and things like class constructors might produce difficult to understand reports
(03:40:12)<RotateMe>hmm can't find it
(03:40:37)<RotateMe>i guess the program has to end returning 0
(03:40:41)<RotateMe>which i can't atm
(03:41:35)<TMCSleep>In order to write the `gmon.out' file properly, your program must exit normally: by returning from main or by calling exit. Calling the low-level function _exit does not write the profile data, and neither does abnormal termination due to an unhandled signal.
(03:42:17)<RotateMe>a'ight
(03:42:18)<RotateMe>^^
(03:42:19)<RotateMe>thanks
(03:44:33)<RotateMe>now it exits normally (with a fine bit of hacking)
(03:44:43)<RotateMe>and there's my gmon.out
(03:44:43)<RotateMe>nice
(03:48:29)<TMCSleep>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle_solutions#An_iterative_solution
(03:49:18)<RotateMe>:( always gives me "gmon.out: not in executable file format"
(03:49:38)<TMCSleep>that C# code is really awful - why would you want 257 line program for something that needs 1 line?
(03:49:48)<TMCSleep>oh
(03:50:29)<TMCSleep>gprof execfil gmon.out > outfile
(03:50:30)<TMCSleep>and
(03:51:44)<TMCSleep>gprof -l execfil gmon.out > outfile
(03:51:47)<TMCSleep>uh
(03:51:50)<TMCSleep>gprof -l execfil gmon.out > outfile2
(03:51:54)<TMCSleep>of course
(03:52:40)<RotateMe>i'm running windows atm
(03:53:37)<TMCSleep>windows has ?
(03:53:40)<TMCSleep>>
(03:53:43)<TMCSleep>I mean
(03:54:33)<RotateMe>gives me execfile: No such file or directory though :(
(03:54:40)<TMCSleep>:P
(03:54:40)<RotateMe>where do i find the gprof manuals?
(03:54:47)<TMCSleep>I meant execfile
(03:54:54)<TMCSleep>the name of your exe file
(03:55:16)<RotateMe>"o_o i knew that of course ^^
(03:55:26)<TMCSleep>http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/binutils/gprof_toc.html
(03:57:14)<RotateMe>thanks a lot, got it now
(03:59:04)<RotateMe>what does -l do?
(03:59:28)<TMCSleep>does line-by-line profiling
(03:59:53)<RotateMe>ah okay
(04:00:32)<RotateMe>hmm i can see the number of calls, but no time % or even time as is
(04:00:39)<RotateMe>it says "no time accumulated"
(04:00:53)<TMCSleep>:O
(04:01:14)<RotateMe>  0.00      0.00     0.00  4885859     0.00     0.00  TCODColor::TCODColor()
(04:01:26)<RotateMe>the most often called function
(04:01:35)<RotateMe>i knew it! this bastard! :D
(04:02:07)<TMCSleep>that's bizarre
(04:02:51)<TMCSleep>so it doesn't say anything like "Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds."
(04:02:58)<RotateMe>it does
(04:03:04)<RotateMe>Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
(04:03:04)<RotateMe> no time accumulated
(04:03:13)<RotateMe>those are the first to lines
(04:03:20)<RotateMe>below Flat profile:
(04:04:19)<RotateMe>still interesting stuff
(04:04:53)<RotateMe>for 6 pathfindings i created 95 nodes (or as it still says in my code Knot :D)
(04:05:14)<RotateMe>this says me it can't really be the object creation
(04:06:01)<TMCSleep>and that meant to be using 50% CPU?
(04:06:13)<RotateMe>since creating 4885859 TCODColor objects took so few time, that i couldn't notice it
(04:06:40)<RotateMe>no, the 50% was a bug i realized 2 seconds after i wrote it
(04:06:48)<RotateMe>units kept creating pathes each frame
(04:07:13)<RotateMe>game runs normal again with about 20% at high times, but framerate still is not good
(04:07:28)<RotateMe>i wish i could see the accumulated time :(
(04:09:19)<RotateMe>hm if it works with system access to measure time, windows vista seems to block that stuff for programs
(04:09:24)<TMCSleep>ah ha!
(04:09:54)<TMCSleep>it seems you have to link with libc_p.a
(04:10:18)<TMCSleep>wait
(04:10:32)<TMCSleep>well, you need to change your linking options
(04:11:19)<TMCSleep>something to the effect of
(04:11:25)<TMCSleep>ld -o myprog /lib/gcrt0.o myprog.o -lc_p
(04:13:08)<TMCSleep>it gets the times (in windows only I think) by running a thread which checks the current execution position every timer interrupt
(04:13:17)<RotateMe>i added -pg to my linking options, why -lc_p, isn't this for line-by-line profiling?
(04:13:37)<RotateMe>ah okay
(04:14:26)<TMCSleep>well, -g -pg should be in your compiling options
(04:14:55)<RotateMe>also there but in the manual it says it should be added to the linker options too i think
(04:15:19)<RotateMe>cc -o myprog myprog.o utils.o -pg
(04:17:16)<TMCSleep>oh, that's for one-step compilation-linking
(04:21:35)<RotateMe>okay
(04:22:06)<RotateMe>hm -lc_p won't work
(04:22:14)<RotateMe>can't find -lc_p on compiling
(04:22:22)<RotateMe>i'll try to add libc_p.a
(04:24:36)<RotateMe>is libcap.a the same? since i don't have libc_p.a
(04:25:06)<TMCSleep>my mingw didn't come with it either
(04:25:28)<TMCSleep>anyway, you can skip it
(04:25:48)<TMCSleep>you just won't be told about calls to crt functions
(04:39:13)<TMCSleeps>time for Sleep
(05:17:54)<RotateMe>wow there's absolutely no information about c++ code profilers on the internet
(05:18:14)<RotateMe>well there is but i seem to be too dumb to find a good soltion (or any solution)

(04:56:09)<the_ru>it's 5 AM

(05:37:42)<MadCacti>what is that keyboard layout
(05:38:53)<the_ru>it's the one I use

(05:39:20)<the_ru>now that I've seen it lined up I've come up with some new ideas

(05:39:45)<the_ru>it's kind of awkward as it is now
(05:39:57)<the_ru>but I don't really want to sacrifice any other key
(05:40:15)<MadCacti>I'm confused
(05:40:29)<MadCacti>you cut your keyboard to bits?
(05:40:35)<MadCacti>or maybe use a touchpad?

(05:43:30)<MadCacti>?
(05:43:38)<MadCacti>no, new zealand
(05:43:43)<Epyon_>Oooooh
(05:43:48)<Epyon_>New Zealand :D
(05:43:51)<MadCacti>not OAKLAND
(05:44:07)<Epyon_>That's the second place in the world that I'd like to live in :D
(05:44:18)<Epyon_>First one being Japan
(05:44:19)<the_ru>I still don't get what we're voting about

(05:49:39)<Epyon_>10 hours by train
(05:50:39)<Epyon_>One more beer
(05:51:21)<the_ru>definitely closer, then

(05:52:10)<the_ru>and
(05:52:22)<the_ru>I'm not sure there will actually be any trains

(04:33:03)<RotateMe>jraregris: fiddled with pathfinding algorithms
(04:33:29)<RotateMe>to be exact, i implemented pre calculated paths between waypoints and made units use those
(04:34:20)<RotateMe>which leads to the problem that units stand in their ways trying to enter one point

(03:28:05)<MadCacti>I'm trying to figure out how to compile an opengl app on this computer
(03:28:32)<MadCacti>does libopengl.a not exist?
(03:28:41)<Aerton>no
(03:28:44)<MadCacti>everything I hear says mingw comes with opengl - and I have the header
(03:29:11)<MadCacti>it doesn't exist?
(03:29:20)<MadCacti>libgl.a then?
(03:29:22)<Aerton>I'm not sure about the mingw part, but normally you don't link it statically
(03:29:25)<greg>libopengl32.a
(03:29:28)<greg>exist
(03:29:29)<greg>:)
(03:29:30)<Glowie>Get a real IDE so that you don't have to play with command line :P
(03:30:01)<Aerton>opengl is a static lib under windows?
(03:30:04)<MadCacti>I'm using devc++
(03:30:22)<Aerton>probably, it's just a wrapper than?
(03:30:32)<Glowie>Get Code::Blocks or Visual Studio
(03:31:05)<Aerton>real men use vim
(03:31:09)<MadCacti>yeah, devc++ sucks
(03:31:13)<MadCacti>I don't actually use it
(03:31:19)<MadCacti>(emacs instead)
(03:32:37)<MadCacti>I've been happily compiling opengl apps on other computers, but I'm too blind to see what went wrong ehre
(03:33:52)<MadCacti>screw it, might as well get codeblocks and a fresh mingw install
(03:34:41)<Glowie>\o/
(03:35:35)<greg>MadCacti get visual studio express 2008 for free it have a good debugger
(03:35:50)<MadCacti>hmmm, tempting
(03:36:13)<greg>i use mingw with dev c++ to write my code and cisual studio to debug it :p
(03:37:10)<MadCacti>I've heard the VS debugger has totally different debugging features to gdb?
(03:37:12)<greg>http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/
(03:37:44)<Glowie>Why do you write the code with DevCpp?
(03:37:55)<Glowie>I find the editor vastly inferior to VS's
(03:38:21)<greg>cause visual studio editor is to slow
(03:39:00)<greg>i used vc++ 6 ide to write code but with vista, it is now impossible to get msvc6 running properly
(03:39:22)<greg>:)
(03:39:30)<Glowie>Version 6 >_>
(03:39:38)<Glowie>Try 2003 or 2005 or 2008
(03:40:10)<greg>now i use msvc express 2008 yep but just for the debuging
(03:40:22)<jraregris>i got 2008, and when i was supposed to register, the microsoft internet wouldn't let me
(03:40:34)<Glowie>I use 2003 so I don't know about that
(03:40:47)<Glowie>But the auto tabbing and name finding etc. is so useful in it
(03:41:38)<greg><jraregris> you want my key ? 
(03:43:08)<Glowie>I thought it was free
(03:43:49)<greg>yeah it is free, you just have to create a msn  passport account if you didnt have one i think

(04:52:59)<greg>nop sorry 
(05:09:36)<MadCacti>ah
(05:09:42)<MadCacti>you didn't get gprof working? :(
(05:18:04)<RotateMe>not really
(05:18:12)<RotateMe>it still doesn't accumulate time :(
(05:24:33)<MadCacti>weird, works for me
(05:24:57)<MadCacti>maybe it's something about your compile options
(05:44:47)<RotateMe>yeah i should try it on a smaller project first but don't have the patience
(05:44:57)<RotateMe>what i do need atm is a better debugger
(05:46:02)<RotateMe>Code::block's debugger accepts so much memory misbehaviour, that will crash during normal runtime
(05:47:18)<MadCacti>...visual studio? :P
(05:47:21)<MadCacti>night
(05:51:25)<RotateMe>night
(05:51:29)<RotateMe>i'll try it
(06:31:17)<RotateMe>hehe my game slowly becomes a pool of hacks
(06:31:49)<Glowie>Good, that's a sign of a progressing project :P
(06:32:14)<RotateMe>i couldn't find the reason why some of the units stopped moving or had wrong pathes memorized, so i just added a check that made them reinitialize when they didn't move for 5 turns
(06:32:46)<RotateMe>plus there are some very strange memory issues which prevent me from adding a watch on my map during debugging
(06:33:01)<Glowie>Okay that's too hacky
(06:33:09)<RotateMe>and the program doesn't return 0 even if i explicitely leave it with return 0;
(06:34:06)<RotateMe>well i don't know if the second thing might be a problem with the code::blocks debugger, becuase map has a pretty large array inside of it
(06:34:18)<RotateMe>i think it's like a 20 mb array
(06:34:31)<Glowie>o_o
(06:34:35)<Glowie>How can it be that big?
(06:35:23)<RotateMe>mapsize is 250x250 and each field has lots of information
(06:35:59)<RotateMe>but i just watched my memory and saw that the whole game just takes 10 mb ram, so my estimation was way off
(06:36:42)<Glowie>Yes it was after I did some calculations too :P
(06:36:57)<Glowie>Should be something like 80 int variables that "lots of information"
(06:38:26)<RotateMe>struct field {
(06:38:26)<RotateMe>    TCODColor floorcolor;
(06:38:26)<RotateMe>    TCODColor tilecolor;
(06:38:26)<RotateMe>    bool blocks;
(06:38:26)<RotateMe>    unsigned char tile;
(06:38:28)<RotateMe>    Being *occupier;
(06:38:30)<RotateMe>    Item *item;
(06:38:32)<RotateMe>    float darkened;
(06:38:34)<RotateMe>    bool is_way;
(06:38:36)<RotateMe>    float blood;
(06:38:38)<RotateMe>    Knot* knot;
(06:38:40)<RotateMe>};
(06:38:42)<RotateMe>that's the "lots of information"
(06:38:51)<RotateMe>it's not that much at all because most of the stuff is just pointers, which i forgot
(06:39:44)<RotateMe>even though, i don't know why everything crashes when i try to watch my map
(06:42:06)<Glowie>Do you need debugging there?
(06:43:45)<RotateMe>everytime i do i just declare a variable that holds the information i need
(06:44:12)<RotateMe>but it's annoying if i still have "*this" in my watches list and come inside Map::* code
(06:44:20)<RotateMe>because it crashes at this point
(06:44:40)<Glowie>Weird.
(06:45:40)<RotateMe>i think what i'll do is declare the array private and replace all direct access to it with a method that checks boundaries
(06:46:03)<RotateMe>maybe that's the reason for some of those mysterious crashbugs
(06:46:17)<RotateMe>the game is hella instable right now :(
(06:47:17)<greg>declare your array as private will not prevent crash
(06:47:20)<Glowie>How did it get to that point :<
(06:55:05)<RotateMe>greg: i just declare it private so that i can be shure i'll track down all places where there's direct access on that array
(06:55:35)<RotateMe>Glowie: it's my absolutely first c/c++ project. not even a hello-world on either one before
(06:56:07)<greg><RotateMe> well if you try to access a null pointer :p there is no difference
(06:56:17)<greg><RotateMe> do you use gdb ? 
(06:56:20)<RotateMe>it's no null pointer crash
(06:56:22)<RotateMe>yes
(06:56:30)<RotateMe>gdb crashes too :D
(06:56:35)<greg>you should try the msvc debugger
(06:56:47)<RotateMe>okay i'll look it up
(06:57:16)<greg>it work when gdb is in trouble :p 
(06:57:39)<RotateMe>hm... is this free?
(06:58:09)<greg>yep
(06:58:28)<greg>wait i give you the link 
(06:58:57)<greg>http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/ here it is
(06:59:30)<Glowie>Okay that might explain something :P
(06:59:35)<greg>if you can't register visual c++ i can give you my key
(07:00:03)<greg><RotateMe> do you use any particuliar lib for your project
(07:00:04)<greg>?
(07:02:19)<greg>if not i may try to run the msvc debugger on your project and monitoring if ;)
(07:02:28)<greg>lucnch time
(07:02:34)<greg>see ya guys
(07:07:31)<RotateMe>yo
(07:08:21)<RotateMe>greg: libtcod (the chronicles of doryen library, a sdl based console emulator with true-color)
(07:08:57)<deveah>too corwded
(07:09:02)<deveah>*crowded
(07:09:07)<RotateMe>:)
(07:09:31)<deveah>can't think
(07:19:19)<greg>ok
(07:21:55)<RotateMe>greg: thanks for the tip!
(07:22:41)<greg>i am downloading the chronicles of doryen library to seee what it is :) 
(07:27:57)<RotateMe>pretty awesome library, i tell ya ^^
(07:34:37)<greg> pretty impresive for a console lookalike lib ^^ 
(07:35:00)<greg>and it have a precompiled binary for gcc and msvc :)
(07:35:47)<greg>:p i prefer allegro :) 
(07:35:50)<greg>XD
(07:35:59)<deveah>i prefer fbgfx
(07:36:42)<deveah>and conlib (curses for amazing speed - 700 fps)
(07:39:43)<greg>conlib make animations smoothiest ? :) 
(07:39:45)<greg>:p
(07:39:57)<deveah>yes, but it's freebasic only
(07:40:15)<greg>http://staffwww.fullcoll.edu/sedwards/ConLib/ConLibIntro.htm
(07:41:16)<greg>it s a wrapper for win32 console api ^^
(07:41:24)<deveah>this is the conLib I'm talking about http://www.freebasic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6847&highlight=conlib
(07:43:01)<greg>ok ^^ 
(07:44:30)<deveah>it uses some kind of triple buffering in the console sys
(07:44:46)<deveah>it's good for demos

(02:01:05)<TMCSleep>pssst, RotateMe
(02:01:22)<TMCSleep>does your program crash or just freeze when you try to watch your map
(02:02:51)<TMCSleep>it should apparently freeze: such an enormous thing can't be watched with hardware watchpoints, so gdb would have to use software implemented ones that check memory every line, which is incredibly slow
(11:05:48)<greg>hi there
(11:06:24)<oeb_werk>Morning greg
(11:06:47)<greg>what's up oeb_werk ? 
(11:08:45)<oeb_werk>Not much, dealing with a killer hangover at the moment though
(11:09:22)<greg>:D
(11:11:42)<greg>try to drink a little glass of vodka to get it away :p
(11:13:14)<greg>and drink a lot of water
(11:17:42)<TMCGone>where do I get a lexer that doesn't make assumptions about whitespace?
(11:19:06)<TMCGone>like, "myfunction", "my function", "My Function" should all be one (equivalent) token
(11:19:10)<TMCGone>uh
(11:21:16)<greg>i don't know sorry 
(12:28:38)<Aerton>hi
(12:30:13)<oeb_werk>Morning
(12:32:55)<the_ru>TMCGone: what? are you insane?
(01:07:00)<TMCGone>hello
(01:07:05)<TMCGone>problem?
(01:08:04)<TMCGone>tokens are separated by newlines, commas, operators or parantheses
(03:11:03)<Kadwiell>Does sound pretty exotic.. is this for something like a custom scripting language? What do you intend a line of code to look like?
(03:42:23)<the_ru>tm
(03:42:42)<the_ru>TMC2: ok, so how do you tell what whitespace is part of the token?
(03:43:11)<the_ru>or actually
(03:43:13)<the_ru>never mind
(03:43:45)<the_ru>but it would certainly allow inconsistent code
(03:44:04)<the_ru>THE   VARIABLE    =    thevariAbLE++;
(03:45:20)<the_ru>I just don't see the point - a strict compiler is one of the few tools we have when we program, and you want to make them less useful?
(03:54:19)<Kadwiell>I guess it would make it easier to, say, communicate code correctly over the phone
(03:54:32)<Kadwiell>Which for all we know may be an important requirement :)
(04:08:50)<TMC2>no, it's an existing scripting language
(04:08:59)<TMC2>I'm writing a code formatter for it
(04:09:31)<TMC2>it doesn't look foreign
(04:09:56)<TMC2>if (flag == true) then (do battle (battle: boss battle))
(04:11:04)<TMC2>unfortunately, I was pressured to implement allowing whitespace in the middle of operators (like '= =') too
(04:12:08)<TMC2>which you might want to do (if you were used to throwing whitespace everywhere) in one case:
(04:12:26)<TMC2>$ id= "asfagg"
(04:12:32)<TMC2>(where =" is an operator)
(04:12:49)<TMC2>or  $id = "asdasdjs"
(04:13:08)<TMC2>ok it's not really an operator
(04:15:25)<Kadwiell>Wow, what language is this? Looks pretty confusing
(04:18:48)<oeb_werk>The dollar before the variables suggests perl or php
(04:21:53)<Kadwiell>Probably inspired by them, but I don't think either perl or php ignores whitespace in that way..
(04:46:27)<TMC2>no, it's hamsterspeak
(04:47:14)<TMC2>a pretty primitive language that doesn't fulling support strings: the $ is a hack string construct
(04:47:21)<TMC2>*fully
(04:48:13)<TMC2>maybe its inspired by pascal, since it has begin and end
(05:09:24)<deveah>math problem: Ann has seven apples. How many apples does Joe have?
(05:10:02)<joe6pack>joe has no apples :(
(05:10:03)<oeb_werk>73
(05:10:52)<deveah>Oblivion time!
(05:12:15)<rnv>extrapolating from gender incoming disparity joe should have ~10 apples 
(05:13:48)<rnv>woohoo
(05:15:05)<Aerton>perhaps, ann took her from joe?
(07:26:33)<jraregris>summer vacation!
(07:32:57)<deveah>not yet for me...
(07:36:18)<jraregris>now I've got three weeks of nothing before i start my summer job
(07:40:08)<deveah>i'll have 3 months of nothingness in 3 weeks :p

(08:07:04)<RotateMe>what's wrong when i get LOTS of those?
(08:07:19)<RotateMe>(just trying to compile my project with VS 2008)
(08:15:40)<RotateMe>hmm the library isn't linked correctly
(08:15:45)<RotateMe>but how do link it?
(08:16:07)<RotateMe>i have the lib file but i can't specify to use it anywhere
(08:16:28)<RotateMe>hi ido
(08:16:35)<joe6pack>hi
(08:16:50)<RotateMe>you're a linux user, aren't you?
(08:17:17)<joe6pack>yese
(08:18:14)<RotateMe>so i guess you won't know how you can link static libraries with visual studio?
(08:22:37)<RotateMe>oh i got it... that was hella unintuative
(08:26:42)<RotateMe>the debugger is hundreds of times better though
(08:29:06)<RotateMe>(compared to Code::Blocks' debugger)
(08:52:34)<joe6pack>RotateMe: no i don't 
(08:52:43)<RotateMe>k, no problem
(08:53:17)<RotateMe>it was a little strange, first i had to add a default search directory for libraries and then the library itself as a "dependency"
(08:53:48)<RotateMe>the compiler is stricter, which is a good thing, i found why my program crashes at random times
(08:57:30)<joe6pack>you can probably get gcc to tell you that as well
(08:57:34)<joe6pack>with -pedantic 
(08:57:38)<joe6pack>or something like that 
(09:10:55)<RotateMe>yeah, but in this the debugger found a SIGSEV that didn't occur when compiled with gcc

(07:51:10)<the_ru>Huh
(07:51:11)<the_ru>What
(07:51:21)<the_ru>They don't like my version numbers? :-)
(07:52:31)<jraregris>who doesn't?
(07:52:43)<the_ru>some people in RGRD
(07:53:14)<the_ru>claiming that I've made a mistake
(07:53:15)<the_ru>heh
(08:02:07)<the_ru>... and when I posted in a forum about my ukulele chord finder, people tried to convince me it didn't do what it should
(08:02:50)<the_ru>as if I didn't know what I need my own software to do
(08:04:49)<jraregris>haha
(08:05:10)<jraregris>is the one you pasted here earlier?
(08:06:30)<the_ru>probably
(08:06:34)<the_ru>I only have one :-)
(08:06:36)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/ukulele.php
(08:06:47)<Fobbah>morning all
(08:06:53)<the_ru>morning
(08:09:19)<Fobbah>lol cool uke chord finder
(08:10:01)<Fobbah>ah and guitar chord finder too nice nice
(08:10:05)<jraregris>yeah, I didn't get that you made it
(08:10:06)<jraregris>cool
(08:10:30)<jraregris>especially there printer-friendly-touch
(08:11:13)<jraregris>what did the forum people miss?
(08:11:37)<jraregris>chord identification?
(08:11:47)<the_ru>most don't like the presentation
(08:11:54)<the_ru>they want finger placement
(08:12:16)<Fobbah>bah, thats not the point
(08:12:20)<the_ru>but I think this is more useful in the long run
(08:12:34)<Fobbah>its more useful to be able to use it while trying to think of alternate fingerings
(08:12:46)<Fobbah>or sweeping runs or whatever
(08:13:48)<jraregris>also the finger placement is awailable anywhere
(08:14:23)<the_ru>and with many chords (especially 7s), they have to figure out themselves how to include all notes
(08:14:26)<jraregris>you've got identification as well. missed it on the first run
(08:14:42)<Fobbah>also the note names in there are nice, it shows you how you can play all the notes of the chord without using all the strings etc
(08:15:37)<Fobbah>neway +1 to chord finder thing lol
(08:15:44)<the_ru>:-)
(08:16:35)<the_ru>It reminds me why I don't usually care to advertise my software
(08:17:37)<the_ru>I usually just get complaints about features I don't have, or requests for crazy features I don't want, and very rarely they have even tried it
(08:18:09)<the_ru>I'd rather rely on word of mouth
(08:18:23)<the_ru>If people really think something is good, it will spread
(08:18:34)<the_ru>If they don't, well, not my loss :-)
(08:18:49)<Fobbah>writing software is more of a way to occasionaly vent my over focused mind from time to time
(08:19:06)<Fobbah>usually when ive got other shit to do lol
(08:19:40)<jraregris>:)
(08:19:51)<the_ru>I just write things that I need and use myself
(08:20:04)<Fobbah>ie, right now its like 4:30 am and i'm all revved up to go out to the city or something, meanwhile stuck here in the land of sobriety due to mountains of work to get done. Hence, roguelike.
(08:21:07)<the_ru>huh
(08:21:16)<the_ru>you want to get drunk thursday morning?
(08:21:33)<Fobbah>its the only way to fly baby.
(08:22:04)<the_ru>...
(08:22:25)<Fobbah>but no not just that, a lot of my friends are out right now, calling me every 20 minutes to tell me how much fun they're having lol
(08:24:09)<the_ru>hm
(08:24:11)<the_ru>student?
(08:24:18)<Fobbah>basically whenever work gets crazy and i shut myself in for a week, i all of a sudden get 6 months worth of dev done on my roguelike
(08:24:25)<Fobbah>part time student
(08:24:30)<Fobbah>work 4 days study 2
(08:24:31)<the_ru>ok
(08:24:44)<Fobbah>so yeah my week is a bit broken up in the middle
(08:26:27)<Fobbah>you full time?
(08:27:00)<the_ru>not anymore
(08:27:03)<the_ru>dropped out
(08:27:15)<Fobbah>i meant at work
(08:27:21)<the_ru>yes
(08:27:37)<the_ru>I'd like to work less though
(08:27:45)<Fobbah>and the outcome of my degree is still a mystery at this stage... i'm most of the way through it so i'm not going to give up, but they could always kick me out hehehe
(08:27:48)<the_ru>maybe 4 days/week, or 6 hours/day
(08:28:05)<Fobbah>i dunno, every time i try to study full time i just want to go back to work, being broke sucks
(08:29:43)<the_ru>I sometimes ponder starting again, mostly to get some free time
(08:30:04)<the_ru>but I'm almost out of debt now, and I don't want to get back into it
(09:48:01)<the_ru>can anyone suggest a physical activity that isn't so heavy for the knees?
(09:48:37)<the_ru>I've been running for a few weeks, but my legs start to hurt
(09:48:44)<the_ru>I need to lose some weight first
(09:55:15)<rnv>swimming, cycling
(09:58:07)<jraregris>sez
(09:58:13)<jraregris>doh.. sex
(10:13:28)<joe6pack>sex actually doesn't burn that many calories afaik

(04:07:02)<Aerton>if he was able to spawn them as an apache user, he should be able to send SIGTERM as an apache user too
(04:07:23)<TMC>no, they are started by the apache daemon
(04:07:37)<TMC>from a php script
(04:08:12)<Kadwiell>A _php_ script? Sounds like a pretty exotic setup
(04:08:21)<Aerton>upload php or python script with a kill command
(04:08:44)<TMC>yeah...
(04:08:55)<TMC>ok
(04:11:34)<TMC>yep :D
(04:19:45)<the_ru>doesn't Apache have a maximum execution time?
(04:19:57)<the_ru>maybe not
(04:20:01)<the_ru>but PHP should have
(04:20:10)<the_ru>30 seconds or something by default
(04:22:35)<TMC>maybe it's a CPU time limit
(04:56:07)<Aerton>ROFL, according to the so-called 'roguelike map' Helsinki is in Africa!
(04:57:20)<Aerton>owww, another Finnish city in Iceland!
(05:01:30)<deveah>gosh I'd like a pocket NES with a SD slot card :D
(05:16:17)<TMCGone>last day of semester today!
(05:16:20)<TMCGone>:( :( :(
(05:18:37)<deveah>it's Education Day here so no school :D
(05:18:49)<deveah>although school isn't over yet :(
(05:21:57)<RotateMe>TMC, why are you frowning over that?
(05:22:34)<RotateMe>got a tough holiday job?
(05:25:56)<RotateMe>rewrote my whole a* stuff today, and the new one is a total mess :(
(05:26:02)<RotateMe>that's something to frown about
(05:28:26)<the_ru>half of FF6 done
(05:28:29)<the_ru>kind of
(05:28:37)<the_ru>I'm on the floating continent
(05:32:43)<RotateMe>never played it beyond the intro, even though it looks pretty damn awesome

(06:08:05)<Aerton>and not a single comment about the game itself
(06:08:13)<Aerton>and it is not even written in C#
(06:11:38)<RotateMe>does somebody use the Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition (or something similiar)
(06:11:50)<greg>yep why ?
(06:15:05)<RotateMe>is there a way i can make it propose stuff like defines, local variables, class names while i type them?
(06:15:22)<RotateMe>it currently just lists members after i enter ::, -> or .
(06:16:18)<greg>:p i use only the debugger i write code with devcpp :D
(06:16:48)<Aerton>I think you need visual assist add-on for that
(06:17:12)<Aerton>or eclipse :-P
(06:18:59)<RotateMe>i switched to visual c++ because of the debugger too
(06:19:33)<RotateMe>but i think it's not a bad ide at all, nothing as bad as i imagined it (being a ms tool)
(06:19:38)<deveah>guys, in a text adventure, how big should the world (the place where everything takes place in the game) should be?
(06:20:14)<Aerton>what's so special about the debugger?
(06:20:24)<Aerton>text adventure as in IF rather than an RL?
(06:21:05)<Aerton>I think the world should be small, but dense
(06:21:11)<Kadwiell>Small enough that you can create interesting content for all of it
(06:21:14)<Aerton>navigation is not a strong point of IF
(06:21:15)<deveah>i'm trying to make a little text adventure and i have problems about setting the space
(06:21:46)<deveah>well not completely NOT roguelike, because it will have a small map like a roguelike screen
(06:21:46)<RotateMe>Aerton: compared to the Code::Blocks debugger the watch handling is just worlds better
(06:22:14)<Aerton>hm, I never used code:blocks
(06:22:31)<RotateMe>plus it catched sigsevs the other one wouldn't
(06:22:38)<RotateMe>which helped me to debug a LOT of stuff
(06:23:10)<Aerton>the other one sounds outright broken
(06:23:57)<joe6pack>only debugger i've used with c development is ddd
(06:24:02)<joe6pack>which is pretty decent 
(06:24:05)<RotateMe>i don't know... might also be because with code::blocks i used the gcc compiler
(06:24:07)<Aerton>ddd is not a debugger
(06:24:07)<joe6pack>although it looks ugly
(06:24:13)<Aerton>just a front-end to gdb
(06:24:15)<joe6pack>it is a front end to gdb
(06:24:21)<joe6pack>yea i know
(06:24:29)<joe6pack>but i don't use gdb by itself
(06:24:52)<joe6pack>loosely speaking a debugger...
(06:25:03)<joe6pack>i also used insight from red hat
(06:25:11)<joe6pack>but it's a bit unreliable 
(06:25:24)<joe6pack>got all kinds of weird shit out of it
(06:26:48)<RotateMe>it seems, i produce weird shit all the time using c++ 
(06:26:52)<RotateMe>but it's getting better
(06:27:25)<RotateMe>wrote 250 lines of pathfinding code without being able to try it, and it actually worked
(06:27:34)<RotateMe>aside from a few compiling errors
(06:31:16)<Aerton>that doesn't sound like a weird shit
(06:46:49)<RotateMe>i'm just not used to the kind of errors my c++ programs (and i think many other c++ programs too) produce
(09:25:37)<RotateMe>guaaaa debugging binary heaps is a pain in the ass
(09:29:40)<purestrain>for a* ?
(09:44:03)<RotateMe>yep...
(09:44:17)<RotateMe>i can't find the error but sometimes not the best one is in front
(09:44:19)<RotateMe>very seldom
(09:45:03)<purestrain>who cares :-)
(09:45:04)<RotateMe>and only if removing an element was involved somewhen, but not neccasserily always directly after removing one
(09:45:10)<RotateMe>very strange and very random
(09:45:48)<RotateMe>you may be right but i want to distribute this code and reuse it myself so...
(09:49:01)<purestrain>if you have a working one, would you mind to share it with me? i'm not in the mood to write one myself ;-)
(09:53:39)<RotateMe>sure, it would be a pleasure ^^
(10:29:29)<RotateMe>this sucks i couldn't fix it and now i'm too tired

(12:49:31)<Mingos>hail RLdevs :)
(12:54:44)<jomiolto>hi :)
(12:59:08)<Mingos>it's quiet here, isn't it?
(12:59:21)<jomiolto>yeah, I guess it is
(12:59:29)<Mingos>is it always so?
(12:59:38)<jomiolto>nah, sometimes it can be quite active
(12:59:49)<Mingos>Last night there was nobody connected
(01:00:00)<jomiolto>nobody?
(01:00:08)<jomiolto>you mean the whole channel was empty?
(01:00:35)<Mingos>yes, dunno what was wrong, there should be bots or something
(01:00:53)<jomiolto>hmm, sounds weird
(01:01:12)<Mingos>maybe I did something wrong :)
(01:01:21)<jomiolto>could be :)
(01:01:40)<Mingos>I installed mIRC yesterday, it's my first IRC adventure :)
(01:01:43)<jomiolto>I've got irc on 24/7 (or at least almost) and there was actually some activity last night
(01:02:02)<Mingos>I must have done somethin wrong then.
(01:02:03)<jomiolto>welcome to the dark side then :)
(01:02:16)<Mingos>dark side? can't be that bad :)
(01:02:39)<Mingos>I already passed to the dark side anyway when I started coding :)
(01:02:39)<jomiolto>well, I guess it's not on certain channels, like this one, but there some quite awful irc channels out there
(01:03:11)<Mingos>awful meaning what?
(01:03:13)<jomiolto>wait... what's wrong with coding?
(01:03:32)<jomiolto>all kinds of awful :)
(01:03:37)<Mingos>it's time consuming, I barely have social life since I code :)
(01:03:55)<jomiolto>channels with rude people or people that post some really sick links, etc.
(01:04:11)<jomiolto>you just need to learn to balance it, that's all...
(01:04:12)<Mingos>oh, that's rather comon, I guess
(01:04:28)<Mingos>any decently popular chat has these
(01:04:34)<jomiolto>yeah, sadly :(
(01:05:16)<Mingos>I'm trying to balance coding and social life, but since I hardly have any... :)
(01:05:47)<jomiolto>I haven't had much of either lately :(
(01:06:01)<Mingos>I sometimes go out with some friends of mine, but that's once per week or so :(
(01:06:04)<jomiolto>too busy with the last univ. courses before the summer
(01:06:22)<Mingos>oh, luckily, I'm done with that :)
(01:06:23)<jomiolto>although now I'm finally free :)
(01:06:40)<Mingos>It's good to have studies over
(01:06:41)<jomiolto>I was going to get some coding done today, but I ended up playing Death Rally for most of the day :/
(01:07:18)<Mingos>I was going to try to get my hand on implementing monsters this night as well... and ended up drunk in the nearby bar :)
(01:07:27)<Mingos>I'm better now, luckily
(01:07:36)<Mingos>But I don't feel like coding
(01:07:43)<Mingos>Not this night
(01:07:56)<jomiolto>heh, drunken coding can be fun sometimes :)
(01:08:05)<jomiolto>or doing maths while drunk
(01:08:14)<Mingos>yeah, and takes month to find all the bugs...
(01:08:24)<Mingos>*months
(01:09:07)<Mingos>I've been looking for the bugs in my dungeon generator for over three month after implementing it while drunk
(01:09:30)<Mingos>finally, I rewrote everything from scratch and foun bugs I wasn't even aware of
(01:09:31)<jomiolto>that's not very nice :(
(01:09:41)<jomiolto>I've had similar experiences
(01:10:17)<jomiolto>and quite often it turns out that the bug is something really trivial that you just haven't noticed
(01:10:48)<Mingos>it was exactly my case
(01:11:29)<Mingos>a single statement that was supposed to be outside a for loop somehow was inside it...
(01:11:45)<Mingos>and everything got mad
(01:11:48)<jomiolto>yeah, those kind of things suck :(
(01:12:13)<jomiolto>and sometimes they're really hard to spot, despite being so obvious
(01:12:32)<Mingos>the effects might be obvious, but the cause never is...
(01:12:45)<Mingos>otherwise, there would be no bugs :)
(01:12:51)<jomiolto>yeah :)
(01:13:26)<jomiolto>just out of curiosity, what language do you use for your roguelike?
(01:13:46)<Mingos>a week back I had a strange bug in the ground shading in my game and it took me three days to correct it
(01:13:50)<Mingos>C
(01:14:04)<jomiolto>wow, so I'm not the only one!
(01:14:12)<Mingos>congrats :)
(01:14:14)<jomiolto>it seems that most people are migrating to more modern languages
(01:14:43)<Mingos>I prefer C to other languages. It's fast, easy to grasp, portable...
(01:14:50)<jomiolto>I've also thought of using Java or perhaps even Python, but for some reason I always keep coming back to good old C :)
(01:15:06)<Mingos>I started uot with Java and migrated to C
(01:16:29)<Mingos>Java might be fun for some tasks, with automatical memory allocation, garbage recollection and stuff, but it's horribly slow... And I NEED speed...
(01:16:57)<Mingos>My dungeon generator needs nearly a second to make a dungeon... Imagine Java, which is roughly 10 times slower...
(01:17:33)<jomiolto>uhm, Java isn't actually that much slower these days with most things
(01:18:10)<jomiolto>generally Java can be very quick, but there are some issues too
(01:18:20)<Mingos>OK, but it still is slower
(01:18:36)<Mingos>it's an interpreted language, C is not
(01:18:46)<jomiolto>personally I hate how bloated the virtual machine is
(01:18:59)<Mingos>besides, I simply can't get used to using classes for everything
(01:19:38)<Mingos>I prefer global variables, functions and that sort of stuff
(01:20:03)<Mingos>I used it as a kid in my first simple programs 10 years ago and it still works fine :)
(01:20:49)<Mingos>And I was unable to run any Java program from outside the compiler... it gave me weird errors within the main class
(01:21:17)<Mingos>Still, my game doesn't run on all computers either
(01:21:37)<Kadwiell>I think most of the slowness of Java comes from having to load large parts of the class library before doing even pretty simple stuff
(01:21:43)<Mingos>My girlfriend's notebook appears to be unable to run TCODlib-powered programs...
(01:22:05)<Mingos>dunno why
(01:22:07)<Kadwiell>So for things that are slow because they require a lot of calculation (like dungeon generation), it's not so much worse..
(01:23:12)<Mingos>Well, it may be so, but I *still* prefer to stick to C :)
(01:23:59)<jomiolto>hmm, it might be interesting to make a roguelike in assembler...
(01:24:07)<jomiolto>I haven't done any real asm coding for a way too long time
(01:24:13)<Kadwiell>Yeah, me too, actually (though I prefer ++)
(01:24:16)<Mingos>If Bruce Eckel states Java is slower, I simply have to believe him :)
(01:24:49)<Mingos>ASM RL... a pain in the arse to make, but real fun to play, right?
(01:25:16)<Kadwiell>I'm not sure it would automatically be more fun to play :)
(01:25:28)<Mingos>Due to its speed, I mean
(01:25:43)<Kadwiell>But it would be a nice exercise
(01:25:48)<jomiolto>I doubt I could make faster asm code than what modern compilers generate...
(01:26:09)<Mingos>ASM is as close to the processor's "language" as it gets, so it would be fast as hell
(01:26:11)<jomiolto>but the tiny executable would be fun :)
(01:26:24)<Mingos>aye, the executables are small indeed
(01:26:48)<jomiolto>perhaps one day I should make a 4kB roguelike as a 7drl :)
(01:27:45)<jomiolto>Mingos: modern compilers actually generate faster code than what most assembler coders could make themselves
(01:28:25)<Mingos>possibly, I don't know ASM :)
(01:28:29)<jomiolto>sometimes when I debug some code generated by gcc (with optimizations on) I'm quite amazed at some of the tricks the compiler does
(01:28:43)<Mingos>such as?
(01:29:17)<jomiolto>like using some special instructions to avoid doing a multiplication (which is slow)
(01:29:29)<Mingos>interesting...
(01:30:02)<Mingos>division seems to be slower, that's why i prefer to multiply by a fraction :)
(01:30:28)<Mingos>dunno if it's faster, but I feel better doing so
(01:30:36)<Kadwiell>I think the compiler optimizes that away at least
(01:30:54)<Kadwiell>If you mean dividing by a constant float/double
(01:31:00)<jomiolto>a multiplication by a power of two can be easily optimized to a bit shift, but numbers that are not powers of two are a bit more difficult
(01:31:16)<jomiolto>bah, who uses floating point? :P
(01:31:29)<jomiolto>integers should be enough for everybody :)
(01:31:39)<Mingos>I do... sometimes at least, despite its limitations and weird behaviour...
(01:31:51)<Mingos>they're handy
(01:32:27)<jomiolto>I don't know why, but for some reason I've always disliked using floating for anything that doesn't necessarily require it
(01:32:36)<Mingos>but I try to use ints whenever possible
(01:32:37)<jomiolto>I wonder if I should have therapy for it?
(01:32:50)<jomiolto>:P
(01:32:51)<Mingos>definitely not
(01:32:57)<Kadwiell>I dislike it in theory, but I need the square root of two or something and everything just becomes much easier with doubles
(01:33:02)<Mingos>floats are inaccurate
(01:33:07)<Kadwiell>then I*
(01:33:28)<Mingos>but still come in handy
(01:34:03)<Kadwiell>Floats are inaccurate, but if you want to deal with nonintegers at all conceptually speaking, you need inaccuracy
(01:34:15)<Mingos>I've a colour modification function based on TCODlib's HSB functions. It can use ints, but requires extra calculations
(01:34:22)<Kadwiell>Otherwise you're using a "Rational" class for everything, and I've been down that road :)
(01:34:29)<Mingos>When I switched to floats, things got faster
(01:35:47)<Mingos>Kadwiell, I had an issue with floats' inaccuracy that made me realize it's better to use ints then it's possible
(01:36:02)<_df_>floats are bad mmm kay
(01:36:39)<jomiolto>it's actually amazing how many algorithms can be adapted to work with pure integers and still give the same accuracy (or even better) as using floating point would give
(01:36:49)<Mingos>they're bad in some situations, but good in others
(01:37:08)<Mingos>exactly, jomiolto, exactly.
(01:37:17)<_df_>most arm cores dont have fpu.. (eg: porting to GP2X)..
(01:37:33)<_df_>so floats really kill you with the soft fpu in software
(01:37:48)<Mingos>and more speed as well, since logical operations on ints are faster than on floats :)
(01:37:52)<jomiolto>Bresenham's algorithms compared to naive line/circle algorithms are a good example of that
(01:38:07)<Kadwiell>Yep, there's Bresenham, and most angle-related stuff on a grid at least
(01:38:27)<Kadwiell>Requires a bit more thinking time to write it that way, though, at least for me
(01:38:43)<jomiolto>I don't know if people usually use floating point for shadow casting, but I adapted it to work with integers and still be precise :)
(01:38:44)<Mingos>There's my Dijkstra's modification that uses ints and gets the same results :)
(01:39:09)<Mingos>With floats, it entered an infinite loop due to its inaccuracies
(01:40:14)<Mingos>now, using only logical additions and ints instead of floats, it's blazing fast and 100% accurate
(01:40:58)<Mingos>and no graph theory involved :)
(01:41:12)<jomiolto>I don't actually mind the speed that much (unless there is a really huge difference, which usually isn't the case), but somehow integer algorithms just feel more elegant to me than ones using floating point
(01:41:59)<Mingos>well, speed is crucial to me...
(01:42:13)<Mingos>I don't want expensive algorithms
(01:42:19)<jomiolto>perhaps it's because I'm somewhat of a maths geek, and I love things being precise
(01:42:44)<Mingos>I'm not a maths geek, but I love things being precise as well
(01:42:58)<Kadwiell>Yeah, me too.. integers (32-bit signed ones) fail in very predictable ways, which is nice
(01:43:07)<Mingos>since you're a maths geek, maybe you can help me on this one:
(01:43:51)<Mingos>I need to find a way for a 2d surface to move along a circular path inside a 3d space
(01:44:40)<jomiolto>hmm, I'm not sure I understand what exactly you mean by that
(01:44:59)<Mingos>or more precisely, find the surface's every single point's 3d coordinates in the 3d space at every step in the circular path
(01:45:38)<jomiolto>oh, I think I get it
(01:46:23)<Mingos>it's about rendering a seamless animation of a 3d fractional brownian motion :)
(01:46:24)<jomiolto>hmm
(01:46:59)<Mingos>since 3d fbm is so slow, I prefer to prerender all frames and save them to file
(01:48:08)<jomiolto>I think I'm way too tired to think about this :)
(01:48:16)<Mingos>I am as well :)
(01:48:30)<jomiolto>it's 3am here
(01:48:33)<Mingos>that's why i ask instead of thinking about it myself :)))
(01:48:38)<jomiolto>hah :)
(01:48:46)<Mingos>where do you live then, Iceland?
(01:48:51)<jomiolto>Finland
(01:49:11)<Mingos>well, that's a nordic country as well :)
(01:49:17)<jomiolto>yes, it is
(01:49:26)<jomiolto>hmm, the sun is just about to rise :/
(01:49:33)<Mingos>In Spain it's 2AM
(01:49:55)<Mingos>And it's about 5 hours til sunrise :)
(01:50:32)<Mingos>I'll have a glass of wine and go to bed I think, i need to get up in 6 hours to go to work
(01:51:14)<Mingos>oof, this glass is HUGE :)
(01:51:30)<Mingos>hope I get up sober
(01:51:38)<Mingos>hope i get up at all :)))
(01:51:40)<jomiolto>you know you don't have to fill it all the way, don't you?
(01:51:55)<Mingos>what do you mean?
(01:51:59)<jomiolto>you could have just half a glass :)
(01:52:14)<Mingos>It's half a glass, actually
(01:52:19)<jomiolto>okay
(01:52:30)<Mingos>but still, it's a lot :)
(01:52:31)<jomiolto>that really sounds like a huge glass then
(01:52:43)<Mingos>good red wine glasses are big
(01:53:00)<Mingos>makes the smell more intense
(01:53:15)<_df_>the finns had some good demo parties back in the day...
(01:53:20)<_df_>so did the swedes...
(01:53:27)<Mingos>assures better wine ventilation
(01:53:55)<_df_>reds are nice :) dry whites suck. single malt whisky even better ;)
(01:54:16)<jomiolto>j√§germeister for the win :)
(01:54:21)<Mingos>I'm out of whisky, but yes, I prefer it to wine
(01:54:37)<Mingos>bourbon, even better
(01:54:43)<_df_>bourbon is foul
(01:54:47)<Mingos>four roses + coke = party!!!
(01:54:50)<jomiolto>or vodka, that is some good stuff too...
(01:54:54)<_df_>whisky owns bourbon
(01:55:09)<Mingos>in a way, yes, whisky owns bourbon
(01:55:36)<Mingos>bourbon derives from whisky, it is made in a very similar way, but tastes sweeter
(01:55:50)<Mingos>I'd say bourbon is yankee whisky :)
(01:57:12)<_df_>bourbon is inferior corn mash to whiskys barley
(01:57:40)<Mingos>that's what gives it the sweet taste :)
(01:58:02)<Mingos>combines great with coke
(01:58:23)<_df_>whisky should taste like smoke. not sweet ;) especially should never mix it in a sweetened soda pop garbage :)
(01:58:43)<Mingos>in case of whisky (12 years or older, if at all possible), it tastes better with apple juice :)
(01:58:53)<_df_>ginger ale, if anything, goes well with whisky.
(01:59:15)<Mingos>never tried this mix, thanks for the idea
(01:59:18)<_df_>the local distiller near mee casks his with apple wood chunks in the barrel. its very nice.
(01:59:49)<_df_>but i dont know about adding apple juice to it
(02:00:13)<Mingos>try it, it's very nice
(02:01:24)<Mingos>apple juice tends to eliminate the taste of ethanol, leaving only the distinctive flavour of whisky
(02:01:38)<Mingos>:)
(02:02:01)<Mingos>anyway, what does it have in common with developing roguelikes???
(02:02:56)<_df_>whisky is the best defense an @ has
(02:03:16)<Mingos>but it's usually called a potion of booze :)
(02:03:35)<jomiolto>alcoholic @s anonymous
(02:04:15)<Mingos>it's better to be a known wino than an anonymous alcoholic :)
(02:04:58)<_df_>lol
(02:05:04)<jomiolto>:)
(02:05:18)<Mingos>I found that one written on a wall in a nearby bar :)
(02:05:57)<jomiolto>*yawn* sleepy time, I guess
(02:06:11)<jomiolto>'night
(02:06:12)<jomiolto>->
(02:07:30)<Mingos>OK, I'll finish the cigarette and go to bed as well
(02:08:15)<Mingos>Finally, I haven't touched the compiler this night, despite my great plans...
(02:09:40)<Mingos>_df_, your name is Stu, right?
(02:10:40)<_df_>yup
(02:11:15)<_df_>i occasionally pop up with some obuse or something random on rgrd, mostly i bite my tongue and dont post :)
(02:12:09)<Mingos>heh, you *did* come up with something killer as a response to my first post :)
(02:13:01)<Mingos>do you really detest the word "magick" that much?
(02:13:17)<Mingos>just out of curiosity...
(02:13:41)<_df_>i did? -_- oh yeah i remember
(02:13:48)<Mingos>:)
(02:14:13)<Mingos>that was my posting that stupid "code-it-for-me_ stuff :)
(02:14:42)<Mingos>oof, I think I'm half drunk, I don't hit the right keys anymore...
(02:14:48)<_df_>yeah I do detest the word (my wife is an english teacher...), use in titles etc would be ok, but not in normal usage.
(02:15:15)<_df_>it would be like having a real life convo with someone who said "lol" instead of just laughing :)
(02:15:42)<Mingos>OK... you'll probably not download Umbrarum Regnum then (if it's ever released) :)
(02:16:02)<Mingos>I don't use the word "magic" at all
(02:16:12)<Mingos>only "magick"
(02:16:28)<Mingos>:)
(02:16:55)<Mingos>Oh, and i didn't rob Enya's samples :)
(02:17:04)<_df_>if I spell "the" as "teh" would it be ok? There is a defined correct spelling :) if your going to use "magick" why not go all the way and use "Majick"
(02:17:06)<Mingos>just to make things clear :)
(02:17:47)<_df_>how is the programming going?
(02:18:27)<Mingos>"magick" is not considered erroneous spelling, it has a slightly different meaning
(02:18:35)<Mingos>it's going very well, thank you
(02:19:19)<Mingos>The game is taking shape
(02:21:34)<_df_>great, if I can run it on linux/amd64 when its out I'll give it a test for ya
(02:22:06)<Mingos>At the moment, it only runs on Windows, but I'll try to make a Linux version as well
(02:22:10)<_df_>i'm debating if I'll include lightening bolt in my current release or bump it for the next... wall reflectivity... I might just bump it so I can get another release out instead of sitting on it for 6 months.
(02:23:02)<Mingos>well, at least you have spells already :)
(02:23:12)<Mingos>I don't even have monsters
(02:23:42)<Mingos>I was going to implement them this night, but I finally passed...
(02:24:04)<_df_>yeah it opened up a nice bevvy of things (fireball lights up dark parts of the map, gas cloud lingers and fades over time back to the concentration point etc...) I just need wall reflectivity for the LB spell and most basic spell effects will be done and I can combine for many variations..
(02:24:25)<Kadwiell>Ah, wall reflectivity.. that's a great YASD facilitator
(02:25:04)<_df_>yeah or dropping a massive area affect spell like fireball one square from yourself ;) 
(02:25:23)<Kadwiell>The wall thing is easier to forget, though :)
(02:25:48)<_df_>true, and how it angles it bounces ;)
(02:27:24)<_df_>im hoping to be able to combine stuff, ie: cast delayed trap on something, cast fireball on it, then invisibility on it and wait for a mosnter to walk over/into it...
(02:28:01)<Mingos>OK, the last ciggie finished, the last glass of wine drunk... going to bed...
(02:28:06)<Mingos>g'night folks
(02:28:12)<_df_>later mate.
(02:29:29)<Kadwiell>Sounds neat, trapmaking is pretty neglected in most RLs
(02:31:03)<Kadwiell>But I'll have to be going to bed as well, it's half past two here
(02:31:12)<_df_>laters
(09:52:33)<the_ru>I dreamed tonight that I was going to rewrite my RL in D
(09:52:34)<the_ru>WTF
(01:36:01)<Aerton>hi there
(01:36:07)<greg_>hi
(05:34:02)<deveah>i've tried something
(05:35:10)<deveah>a text adventure engine with room system(x,y,name,description,exits) and item system(in_what_room,what_kind,takeable) should be enough
(05:46:26)<deveah>Morrowind vs Oblivion vs Star Wars Jedi Knight 2 Jedy Academy vs roguelikes vs text adventures vs Unreal Tournament 2004 vs Wolfenstein 3d vs Jazz Jackrabbit 2 . . 
(06:16:48)<TMCGone>LOL @ the_ru
(06:20:15)<Mingos>hi all
(06:20:53)<TMCGone>hi
(06:22:03)<Mingos>any interesting conversations today?
(06:24:54)<TMCGone>quite a lot
(06:24:57)<TMCGone>but I wasn't here
(06:25:53)<TMCGone>lots of stuff about debuggers, alcohol, haircuts, magic systems and favourite programming languages it seems
(06:26:22)<purestrain>holy war
(06:28:32)<Mingos>alcohol???
(06:28:35)<Mingos>again???
(06:28:56)<TMCGone>doesn't the bot keep logs somewhere?
(06:28:57)<Mingos>I talked about whisky vs. bourbon last night for almost an hour here :)
(06:29:11)<TMCGone>well I guess that was it
(06:29:22)<TMCGone>I'm reviewing my logs from the last ~24 hours
(06:30:15)<Mingos>could be... I'll see it up, I haven't logged out since yesterday, so my conversation and all other are right over these lines :)
(06:31:17)<Mingos>hm, it seems that my conversation about alcohol is the last longer one :)
(06:33:11)<joe6pack>TMCGone: yes
(06:33:19)<joe6pack>http://yehieli.info/rgrd/log.txt
(06:35:43)<TMCGone>so ownership of the bot no longer passing around I suppose
(06:35:55)<joe6pack>you want it?
(06:36:02)<TMCGone>(I was away for a week or two while there was activity of the bot)
(06:36:19)<joe6pack>i'm running it cause (surprise surprise) no one else will
(06:36:25)<TMCGone>no, I'm learning python and have a million projects and exams, no time to dabble in java too :P
(06:36:28)<deveah>hey ido
(06:36:33)<joe6pack>hi deveah 
(06:36:44)<deveah>how did you make the ip adress into a web adress?
(06:36:58)<joe6pack>i bought a domain name
(06:37:10)<TMCGone>:P
(06:37:22)<deveah>oh, so no ip masking?
(06:37:27)<deveah>and that shit?
(06:37:29)<joe6pack>urm
(06:37:38)<joe6pack>i don't remember what i did
(06:37:52)<deveah>i mean smth like 200.200.1.255 into yehieli.info ?
(06:38:12)<TMC2>hmm, 33 day uptime
(06:38:15)<joe6pack>i think i just messed around in my provider's setting page 
(06:38:20)<purestrain>tell me whata magic about the domain ?
(06:38:23)<purestrain>whats
(06:38:30)<TMC2>I can't help but have long uptime when the computer doesn't turn on once it's restarted!
(06:42:06)<deveah>and ido, how much do you pay for the domain? (per month)
(06:43:55)<joe6pack>deveah: i think 2 euros or so
(06:44:03)<deveah>wow that's cheap
(06:44:04)<joe6pack>don't remember exactly 
(06:44:09)<joe6pack>yea
(06:44:15)<deveah>domain only, or webspace included?
(06:44:19)<joe6pack>it was a specail price for .info domains 
(06:44:22)<joe6pack>only somain
(06:44:27)<joe6pack>i have a server at home
(06:44:31)<deveah>oh, so it's expensive then
(06:44:37)<joe6pack>maybe that was pro year?
(06:44:53)<deveah>.ro domains cost 30 euros for activation and that's it - no more fees
(06:45:37)<joe6pack>huh
(06:45:48)<deveah>and if you want 500 mb, you just pay 1 euro/month
(06:46:04)<deveah>you just pay once for the domain name
(07:01:43)<TMC2>ooo, a distributed screensaver :o
(07:08:36)<TMC2>http://sheepserver.net
(07:48:34)<Mingos>hmm, Ive just found out that using "if"s constantly is faster than "if"-"else if"-"else if"... I thought it should be the other way round...
(07:49:15)<TMC2>whaaaat
(07:49:55)<TMC2>it must be the other way around
(07:50:33)<TMC2>a chain of else if's is equivalent to a goto theend; in each if block
(07:50:54)<deveah>i know the same
(07:51:07)<deveah>who said that?
(07:51:25)<TMC2>but when optimising code, I've noticed that random changes can have a large surprising effect of the speed of a block of code
(07:52:02)<deveah>using, say a 1000 rnd's, will slow down A LOT my code?
(07:52:28)<Mingos>I thought it would be the other way round as well, but a 25 second test of an algorithm that is almost 100% ifs seems to run faster than with if-elses...
(07:52:44)<deveah>i'm trying to make "Randomfight0rz", an ASCII top-down view randombased space shooter
(07:52:50)<TMC2>writing my own random function was vastly faster than usint the crt rand(), even though it produced the same numbers
(07:53:02)<TMC2>I guess there is a lot of overhead in library calls?
(07:53:09)<TMC2>I don't know anything about ABI's, etc
(07:53:38)<TMC2>the ifs are all mutually exclusive?
(07:53:57)<Mingos>Yes, that's why I used if-elses
(07:54:06)<Mingos>and the stuff slowed down!
(07:54:14)<TMC2>order is *very* important
(07:54:31)<TMC2>did you change the order at all? I suppose not
(07:54:40)<Mingos>no... why?
(07:54:48)<TMC2>it could be something to do with the optimiser
(07:54:57)<Mingos>how so?
(07:55:12)<TMC2>prehaps your compiler is less able to optimise if else chains or something related
(07:55:39)<Mingos>it's VS2008, I don't think it has such problems :)
(07:55:59)<TMC2>did you compile with optimisation both times?
(07:56:34)<TMC2>even modern C compilers are bad at optimising code compared to humans
(07:57:15)<Mingos>Umm... you mean VS has automatical code optimisation?
(07:57:21)<TMC2>for instance, C++ is designed so that writting the same code with lots OO techniques, and it pure C, should compile to the same assembly if not doing anything fancy
(07:57:51)<TMC2>but in reality, the C++ code is often waaay slower because an enormous amount of compiler optimisation would be required :(
(07:58:11)<Mingos>I use procedural C only
(07:58:23)<TMC2>any C compiler optimises :P
(07:58:42)<Mingos>automatically?
(07:58:52)<joe6pack>yes
(07:58:59)<deveah>fbp0wah'd
(07:59:05)<joe6pack>no every but every serious one
(07:59:18)<joe6pack>i guess you can find some toy ones that don't 
(07:59:20)<Mingos>then I must have compiled with optimization both times
(07:59:58)<TMC2>you should check your settings though - debugging builds normally are built with optimisation turned off
(08:00:41)<TMC2>I think it's normal to only turn them on for the release builds, since it adds to compile time
(08:01:13)<Mingos>anyone is familiar with VS2008? Where do I turn it on/off?
(08:01:57)<Mingos>wait, found it. optimization is off
(08:04:43)<TMC2>when you are trying to finetune your performance, you definitely need it on, because a change that speeds up the unoptimised build will often slow down the optimised build
(08:04:58)<Mingos>umm, got an error "cl : Command line error D8016 : '/O2' and '/RTC1' command-line options are incompatible"
(08:05:04)<TMC2>(for example, by obscuring things so that the compiler is less able to optimise)
(08:05:23)<TMC2>run time checking?
(08:05:57)<TMC2>I don't know anything about VC++
(08:06:44)<TMC2>uh oh looks like RTC1 is something about dynamic_cast<> :(
(08:08:51)<Mingos>Runtime Checks... don't know how to turn this one off...
(08:10:45)<Mingos>OK, disabled. It compiled successfully with optimization
(08:11:40)<Mingos>HOLY SHIT!!! IT HALVED THE CALCULATION SPEED!!!
(08:13:12)<TMC2>only half? :(
(08:13:20)<Mingos>dungeon generation average speed dropped from 449 ms to 278 ms! Well, almost halved it, then... But still, it's nice :)
(08:13:57)<Mingos>And I had no idea such tricks existed!
(08:14:11)<TMC2>not exactly a trick :P
(08:14:27)<purestrain>removed a sleep(250) ?
(08:14:53)<Mingos>well, I've started coding about half a year ago, I still have a long way to go :)
(08:17:07)<Mingos>man, everything runs so smoothly now! And I thought my code was fast :)
(08:17:38)<purestrain>o_O dungeon generation causes your game to run smoothly ?
(08:19:36)<Mingos>no, I mean EVERYTHING runs smoother with code optimization
(08:20:51)<Mingos>well, 3d fractional brownian motion still runs slowly :) but faster than before
(08:22:29)<purestrain>woha
(08:40:01)<TMC2>fractional?
(08:46:46)<Mingos>fractional of fractal, it's the same. Also known as FBM :)
(08:47:27)<TMC2>I don't suppose this is a RL?
(08:47:31)<Mingos>I rearranged the ifs and if-elses by the occurrence frequence and now the stuff runs even faster :)
(08:47:34)<Mingos>It's a RL
(08:47:49)<Mingos>but with some visual effects :)
(08:48:36)<Mingos>why? RLs are not allowed to use FBM?
(08:49:05)<Mingos>I think fractals are quite common in, for example, random overworld generation, aren't they?
(08:49:24)<Mingos>I use them for other purposes :)
(08:50:20)<Mingos>I use noise generators for visual effects like smoke or ground shading, to make things more pleasant to look at
(08:51:34)<Mingos>but the 3d FBM is way too slow to render it in real time, so at the moment i use Perlin noise for background smoke effect :)
(08:52:06)<Mingos>doesn't look as good, but at least it's fast :)
(08:53:02)<TMC2>hmm, neat
(09:00:07)<TMC2>how exactly do you simulate 3d FBM? I'm having a hard time finding material
(09:01:13)<TMC2>http://www.mndl.hu/works/fractalcow
(09:11:13)<Mingos>It's included in TCODlib, I don't even know how it works
(09:11:46)<Mingos>I just give the coordinates of every pixel and call the proper function to get its noise value
(09:12:35)<Mingos>The dungeon generator now runs really fast: 120 ms average time of dungeon generation. Nice :)
(09:12:46)<Mingos>Manual optimization rules :)
(09:18:02)<TMC2>every pixel????
(09:18:07)<TMC2>that's madness
(09:18:36)<TMC2>that sort of thing can probably be sped way up
(09:19:15)<TMC2>using highly optimised libraries for computations is a great way to speed up some slow algorithm
(09:22:43)<Mingos>jice's noise generator generates noise and returns values for single pixels
(09:23:41)<Mingos>well, not pixels, cells in the console emulator
(09:23:54)<TMC2>for example, that sort of thing probably uses lots of trig functions - using vector (SIMD) CPU hardware, you can calculate multiple sin's, cos's, exp's, log's etc at once very quickly :P
(09:24:33)<Mingos>Still, it needs to be run 12228 times in the resolution I use EACH FRAME, which is a lot...
(09:24:36)<TMC2>(I'm going to try applying that to speeding up a strange attractor rendering program - it'll be the first time I've programmed with vector maths)
(09:24:58)<TMC2>but you are using it for pixels? or cells?
(09:25:21)<Mingos>cells (8x8 pixels)
(09:25:33)<TMC2>ah, that's a bit better then :P
(09:25:42)<Mingos>but you can use it for pixels as well :)
(10:09:58)<purestrain>so, now i could spend my time developing a binary heap, too....
(10:11:02)<TMC2>reuse someone elses!
(10:11:30)<purestrain>i didn't find one in d
(10:14:04)<TMC2>oh, you're writing in D?
(10:14:19)<TMC2>did you happen to discuss D with ru last night? :P
(10:14:36)<purestrain>no
(10:14:54)<TMC2>aww
(10:14:55)<TMC2>[19:58] <the_ru> I dreamed tonight that I was going to rewrite my RL in D
(10:14:55)<TMC2>[19:58] <the_ru> WTF
(10:15:05)<TMC2>XD
(10:15:13)<purestrain>i'm a step ahead... i already did =D
(10:15:18)<TMC2>hahah
(10:57:26)<purestrain>uah... finished writing the binary heap
+++ The date has changed: 2008/06/07 +++
(10:16:18)<purestrain>so what... says red zak
(01:05:38)<TMCSleep>back to sleep...
(02:39:14)<purestrain>anyone using code::blocks ?
(05:43:23)<RotateMe>yeehaw, pathfinding works and is hella fast
(05:46:25)<joe6pack>:)
(05:46:37)<joe6pack>which algorithm are you using?
(05:48:08)<RotateMe>A* with binary heaps
(05:48:25)<RotateMe>assisted by waypoints
(05:48:36)<RotateMe>on a 250x250 map
(05:48:53)<joe6pack> assisted by waypoints?
(05:48:55)<joe6pack>what do you mean
(05:53:51)<RotateMe>units nead to move across the whole map, but this would cost pretty much time at once, so i put waypoints all over the map which units use as temporary targets
(05:54:16)<joe6pack>oh ok
(05:54:35)<RotateMe>one waypoint points to two waypoints which are nearer to any of the two "camps"
(05:54:50)<RotateMe>(and i'm currently implementing forks)
+++ The date has changed: 2008/06/08 +++
(12:43:07)<Kadwiell>Hmm, not sure I understand how you're doing the pathfinding between waypoints.. isn't it feasible to use A* "freely" between them, too, i.e. letting each waypoint could point to much more than just two other waypoints?
(12:44:43)<Kadwiell>(I.e. with only the waypoints as vertices.. thus still much "coarser" and faster than A* over every cell)
(01:04:22)<RotateMe_away>not sure i understand what you mean...
(01:04:44)<RotateMe_away>to just use waypoints instead of a*?
(01:05:44)<Perdurabo>evening
(01:09:47)<RotateMe>hi
(01:27:13)<Kadwiell>Well, I'm not sure I understood what you were doing.. but if you are using very few potential "next waypoints" from each waypoint, I think there's a possibility of weirdness
(01:27:36)<Kadwiell>Not that I can think of an example at the moment
(01:32:33)<RotateMe>there's only one next waypoint from each waypoint
(01:33:04)<RotateMe>this is because it's more of a strategy game like map with two camps on each side
(01:33:24)<RotateMe>waypoints connect those camps and units only move from their camp to the enemy
(01:34:00)<RotateMe>but like i said, i'm adding forks, which just makes waypoints randomly show one of all possible next waypoints to the unit
(01:37:27)<Kadwiell>Hmm, okay
(01:38:27)<Kadwiell>My idea was to use standard pathfinding (e.g. A*) on an "abstract" scale, that is, just between the waypoints (with costs and paths precalculated)
(01:39:08)<Kadwiell>Would be more flexible, but a little more expensive, so if your design doesn't call for it I guess it's not necessary
(01:43:14)<RotateMe>wouldn't it be vice versa?
(01:44:15)<RotateMe>less expensive because there are less waypoints than squares but less flexible for the same reason?
(01:44:34)<RotateMe>but it's a good idea in general
(01:45:21)<RotateMe>problem is, it's often hard to assure that one waypoint after the other can be reached without any pathfinding neccassery
(01:45:33)<RotateMe>depends of how complex your dungeons are i guess
(01:45:54)<RotateMe>gotta go now though, cu
(11:31:41)<Grisnak>Hello?
(11:37:42)<joe6pack>hello!
(11:41:29)<purestrain>greetings
(12:06:17)<Grisnak>How are you guys?
(12:06:23)<Grisnak>Sorry, I was reading up on some things.
(12:06:46)<Grisnak>I just came across this chan reading up on some RL dev blogs and stuff
(12:07:37)<Grisnak>Im quite new to C++ but I am really interested in making my own RL type game. :)
(12:10:09)<RotateMe>hi
(12:10:21)<RotateMe>doing an RL is a great way to learn a language
(12:10:32)<RotateMe>just don't take your expectations too high
(12:10:37)<Grisnak>Oh I know.
(12:10:42)<RotateMe>i'm just learning c++ while coding my game
(12:10:43)<Grisnak>I have a buddy that is going to be helping out
(12:10:57)<RotateMe>that's very good
(12:11:00)<Grisnak>Hes been coding in C++ for a while, so it will be pretty good.
(12:11:03)<Grisnak>Yeah.
(12:11:09)<Grisnak>I also have tons of E books and stuff
(12:11:19)<RotateMe>especially small questions are often hard to find in books or via internet
(12:11:25)<Grisnak>Yeah
(12:11:33)<RotateMe>e.g. how do i sort units best?
(12:11:35)<Grisnak>And he is also helping to point me into the right direction
(12:11:37)<Grisnak>Yeah.
(12:11:58)<Grisnak>Espically for specfic questions that arent really covered
(12:11:59)<RotateMe>any screenshot/info/demos of your attempt yet?
(12:12:09)<Grisnak>Oh, I have JUST started it
(12:12:19)<Grisnak>Im just got the general ideas down in a text format
(12:12:40)<Grisnak>Basicly I want it real time, and kind of an alternate world format
(12:12:47)<Grisnak>thats Similar to current time
(12:12:51)<Grisnak>but with a few twists
(12:13:09)<Grisnak>And no real "class" restrictions
(12:13:10)<RotateMe>if you're doing it OO, do a small sketch of how you will organize your game objects wise
(12:13:21)<Grisnak>Yeah, kinda like in psuedo code
(12:13:25)<RotateMe>sounds interesting
(12:13:28)<Grisnak>Yeah
(12:13:40)<Grisnak>The "class" structer is going to resemble Dungeon Siege
(12:13:51)<Grisnak>the more you use skills and weapons the better you get with them
(12:14:02)<Grisnak>that way you can make a hybrid char 
(12:14:04)<RotateMe>ah that
(12:14:07)<RotateMe>'s nice
(12:14:12)<Grisnak>but if you end up not liking the way your guy is turning out
(12:14:19)<Grisnak>you can just change what you use
(12:14:25)<Grisnak>and go fight lowbie mobs
(12:14:28)<Grisnak>to get the new skills up
(12:14:29)<RotateMe>yeah i liked that about dungeon siege
(12:14:36)<Grisnak>instead of dumping your lvl 30+ char
(12:14:49)<RotateMe>make sure you add the progress bars, they made leveling fun for some reason
(12:14:56)<Grisnak>And instead of magic, its going to be Psyonics and mind conroll
(12:15:01)<Grisnak>Yeah.
(12:15:10)<RotateMe>a screenshot of what i'm doing atm: http://home.arcor.de/avielsstand/Aviel01.jpg
(12:15:10)<Grisnak>We are going to have skill levels and character levels
(12:15:18)<RotateMe>(the red stuff is blood ^^)
(12:15:27)<Grisnak>Oh wow
(12:15:29)<Grisnak>Very nice.
(12:15:59)<Grisnak>what enviorment do you use?
(12:16:13)<RotateMe>C++ and a roguelike library called libtcod
(12:16:18)<Grisnak>me too!
(12:16:19)<Grisnak>well
(12:16:21)<Grisnak>I plan on it
(12:16:25)<RotateMe>yeah use it
(12:16:32)<RotateMe>it can't be easier, believe me
(12:16:36)<Grisnak>hehe
(12:17:00)<Grisnak>I was also thinking about picking up the rogelike library from Sourceforge
(12:17:00)<RotateMe>this is my VERY first project in c/c++
(12:17:05)<Grisnak>Oh wow
(12:17:12)<Grisnak>So you havent been coding for long then?
(12:17:36)<Grisnak>Or just in C/C++
(12:17:45)<RotateMe>i have kind of but i used a basic dialect called BlitzBasic and after that BlitzMax before
(12:17:57)<Grisnak>Ahh
(12:18:03)<Grisnak>Im completely new to coding
(12:18:07)<RotateMe>and than Java, ABAP (for work only), and now I got to C/C++
(12:18:23)<Grisnak>I tried out python a long time ago
(12:18:33)<Grisnak>But I have been wanting to do C++ for ages
(12:18:40)<Grisnak>and just got my arse in gear
(12:18:45)<RotateMe>than it's not going to be easy with C, but I guess it's a good thing to start with something so popular
(12:18:52)<Grisnak>Yeah
(12:18:57)<Grisnak>If you need any ebooks
(12:19:04)<Grisnak>I have just about every C++ book written
(12:19:04)<Grisnak>:)
(12:19:15)<RotateMe>but maybe you should think about not doing it OO... i just don't think it's a good way to learn programming
(12:19:25)<RotateMe>me too ^^, pirate bay for the win :D
(12:19:29)<Grisnak>I agree!
(12:19:34)<RotateMe>but thanks for your offer
(12:19:42)<Grisnak>Well, you dont HAVE to use OO in C++ right?
(12:19:54)<Grisnak>I figured that the OO part is optional
(12:19:55)<Grisnak>right?
(12:20:25)<Grisnak>cause C++ is based on C with oo stuff added to make things more powerfull
(12:20:32)<Grisnak>is what Ive gathered
(12:20:41)<purestrain>then it is no c++
(12:20:48)<purestrain>without oop
(12:21:12)<Grisnak>yeah
(12:21:15)<RotateMe>i disagree
(12:21:29)<Grisnak>But I dont have to use OO stuff to code in C++ and im still coding right?
(12:21:35)<Grisnak>you know what I mean
(12:21:41)<Grisnak>kinda hard to explain what Im thinking
(12:21:44)<Grisnak>I just woke up. :)
(12:21:50)<purestrain>you are not coding c+ then, just c
(12:21:53)<RotateMe>c++ offers an advanced library and has many changed (easier) coding directives, it's not only OO that makes C++
(12:22:08)<purestrain>what library ?
(12:22:21)<purestrain>what change s ?
(12:22:24)<Grisnak>Well, even if Im just coding in C, I still have the added options to add in OO stuff. :)
(12:22:43)<purestrain>right
(12:23:02)<Grisnak>So Im good to go. :D
(12:23:12)<Grisnak>Oh, quick question
(12:23:15)<RotateMe>much stuff from c++ is in c now too, that's right but for example in strict c you're not allowed to use tabs as inlines
(12:23:19)<RotateMe>(only two spaces)
(12:23:27)<RotateMe>or the way you define structs
(12:23:38)<Grisnak>Is there somewhere I can get the code to make an actual window, cause Ive found that windows codign is scary looking
(12:24:03)<RotateMe>where i might be mistaken is that some stl stuff is c++ only
(12:24:06)<RotateMe>or is it not?
(12:24:25)<purestrain>every sl stuff is c++
(12:24:28)<purestrain>stl
(12:24:40)<purestrain>since 'template' library
(12:25:01)<RotateMe>okay than that's what i meant with an added library
(12:25:20)<purestrain>but stl is oo
(12:25:40)<RotateMe>you can use the whole stl library coding in functions
(12:25:58)<RotateMe>only that the stuff is made the oo way doesn't mean that because you're using it, you're coding oo
(12:26:06)<RotateMe>Grisnak: if you're going to use the libtcod, don't worry about coding a window
(12:26:09)<purestrain>then he uses oop
(12:26:12)<Grisnak>Oh ok
(12:26:13)<Grisnak>cool
(12:26:30)<Grisnak>Oh then Ive already been doing that stuff purestrain
(12:26:31)<Grisnak>:)
(12:26:58)<RotateMe>libtcod creates a window once you initialize it, you just say him what size it is and which font you want to use
(12:27:09)<Grisnak>Oh cool
(12:27:17)<RotateMe>everything in the documentation has examples
(12:27:21)<Grisnak>That is good stuff
(12:27:22)<Grisnak>hehe
(12:28:09)<RotateMe>purestrain: what i meant is that he can use functions and tools that are done in oo, but actually coding in oo is imo no good way to learn programming
(12:28:48)<purestrain>it is a good way
(12:29:11)<Grisnak>Ok, Im using CodeBlocks, so do I download the Minwg32 libtcod?
(12:29:19)<RotateMe>yep
(12:29:19)<purestrain>sorry for short answes, im on phone
(12:29:22)<Grisnak>kk
(12:30:16)<Grisnak>So where are you guys from?
(12:30:17)<purestrain>do it the oo way from beginning
(12:30:26)<purestrain>ger
(12:30:40)<RotateMe>purestrain: no problem ^^ but i don't know... i've got a lot of people that study along with me, they have never programmed before and our teacher does oo straight from the start. i'm sure, some of them don't even know what the advantages are or what "procedural" programming is
(12:30:41)<Grisnak>US here
(12:30:45)<RotateMe>ger, too
(12:31:05)<RotateMe>me and purestrain are the only two german roguedevs according to RogueMundi ^^
(12:31:14)<Grisnak>:o
(12:31:16)<RotateMe>Grisnak: where from in the US?
(12:31:22)<Grisnak>I live in NC currently
(12:31:30)<Grisnak>but I am orgionally from Detroit, MI
(12:31:40)<RotateMe>kk
(12:31:53)<RotateMe>http://www.roguetemple.com/map/index.jsp
(12:32:00)<RotateMe>you should add yourself here
(12:33:25)<Grisnak>I will right now. :)
(12:35:46)<RotateMe>Grisnak, i've used code::blocks before, but eventually i found that the debugger of visual c++ 2008 (which is completely free) is much better
(12:36:24)<RotateMe>also, VC++ was capable of catching some of the stranger errors you produce with c++ (sigsevs &| memory violations)
(12:37:15)<greg>:)
(12:37:18)<RotateMe>also, for some reason the VC++ compiler (i don't know what it's called) produces a 75% smaller executable file than gcc
(12:37:28)<Grisnak>hehe added
(12:37:38)<RotateMe>hi greg, thanks for the link to vc++ btw
(12:37:47)<RotateMe>(at least i think it was you)
(12:37:48)<greg>hi ;) no problem 
(12:38:05)<greg>yep it was
(12:38:07)<Grisnak>Hey greg, quick question
(12:38:12)<Grisnak>Prob completely unrelated
(12:38:14)<greg>yes ? 
(12:38:15)<Grisnak>and odd question
(12:38:18)<RotateMe>i was pretty surprised that it's free and that it's actually a good program ... by MS!?
(12:38:23)<Grisnak>one sec I have to remember the name
(12:38:27)<Grisnak>Oh
(12:38:35)<Grisnak>Do you by chance know the site Rpgmatch.com?
(12:38:45)<greg>no at all 
(12:38:53)<Grisnak>Ok, :)
(12:39:03)<Grisnak>I just knew a guy named greg that was  a dev
(12:39:17)<Grisnak>and ive never really seen anyone else run around as the name greg on the internet
(12:39:25)<Grisnak>but I guess I was bound to run into another!
(12:39:26)<Grisnak>:P
(12:39:52)<Grisnak>It would have been cool if you were the same dude. :P
(12:40:04)<greg>:) yes 
(12:40:08)<purestrain>40 minutes.... i hate my provider
(12:40:13)<greg>but you know greg is a wide spread name
(12:40:16)<Grisnak>40 min for what?
(12:40:19)<Grisnak>Yeah
(12:40:28)<Grisnak>Just not many people use thier real name on the internet
(12:40:32)<Grisnak>From what ive seen
(12:41:08)<greg>:p i have a lack of imagination that is why i use my real name 
(12:41:15)<purestrain>talking abouti've cancelled all my agreements since i'm not very pleased
(12:41:26)<purestrain>but they just answered to the first page of 6
(12:41:40)<RotateMe>eins und eins?
(12:42:07)<Grisnak>heh
(12:42:10)<Grisnak>I hate that.
(12:42:11)<RotateMe>we actually switched to telecom, they're the only ones where you don't have to take a crappy internet telephone flat
(12:42:29)<RotateMe>i hate internet telephone, it just doesn't work
(12:43:14)<purestrain>1&1, yeah
(12:43:51)<Grisnak>Yeah, its a great concept
(12:43:56)<Grisnak>but just fails in execution
(12:43:59)<RotateMe>yep
(12:44:20)<Grisnak>So anyone got any hobbies other than coding?
(12:44:41)<RotateMe>biking and drinking ^^
(12:44:51)<Grisnak>hehe
(12:44:56)<RotateMe>usually in that order
(12:44:58)<Grisnak>I draw and play guitar
(12:45:28)<RotateMe>in a band?
(12:45:32)<Grisnak>Used to be
(12:45:33)<RotateMe>or just accustic for fun?
(12:45:34)<greg>yeah doing physics reading, brewing, object making
(12:45:34)<Grisnak>for 6 years
(12:45:43)<purestrain>hua, biking too
(12:45:44)<Grisnak>Oh I was going to do brewing a while ago
(12:45:46)<purestrain>mountainbiking
(12:46:02)<Grisnak>I have a link to my old band if you are interested RotateMe
(12:46:13)<RotateMe>yeah send it
(12:46:23)<Grisnak>www.myspace.com/harbingerdetroit
(12:46:28)<Grisnak>I played bass in that band.
(12:46:38)<Grisnak>Its a really crappy demo and sounds worse on myspace
(12:46:40)<Grisnak>but it was free
(12:46:43)<Grisnak>so cant really compain
(12:46:44)<greg>brewing is really fun, i have produce 25 liters of the harshiest beer of the wordl :p
(12:46:48)<Grisnak>and we were REALL REALLY drunk
(12:46:52)<Grisnak>:x
(12:47:24)<Grisnak>be warned, it is metal
(12:47:32)<RotateMe>^^ i just noticed
(12:47:38)<Grisnak>It has a nice groove though
(12:47:52)<purestrain>metal ftw
(12:47:59)<Grisnak>Its pretty easy to get into
(12:48:11)<Grisnak>We almost got signed to road runner records a few years back
(12:48:21)<RotateMe>purestrain: I'm a smoker, so i just ride a mountainbike, but i don't bike mountains :D
(12:48:32)<Grisnak>heheh
(12:48:32)<purestrain>lol
(12:48:33)<RotateMe>wow, not bad
(12:48:47)<Grisnak>Yeah, I think we had a great sound
(12:49:04)<Grisnak>and the end product, considering our individual influences is quite amazing
(12:49:54)<Grisnak>Our drummer and singer were into hardcore, one guitarist was into mostly black metal and some death metal, other guitarist was into classic rock and regular metal and I am into mainly death metal, some black metal and regular metal
(12:50:15)<Grisnak>And the end product was that
(12:50:28)<RotateMe>well, you could agree on metal i guess :D
(12:50:51)<Grisnak>well
(12:50:52)<Grisnak>kind of
(12:51:04)<RotateMe>not what i usually listen too, only at live concerts
(12:51:06)<Grisnak>everyone wanted to put in more of thier style
(12:51:10)<Grisnak>Oh man
(12:51:11)<Grisnak>our live shows
(12:51:14)<Grisnak>were just AMAZING
(12:51:24)<Grisnak>we actually wrote these parts
(12:51:29)<Grisnak>we called "beer breaks" 
(12:51:31)<Grisnak>into songs
(12:51:39)<Grisnak>where we would hold out a note for real long
(12:51:45)<Grisnak>and everyone in the band would slam thier beers
(12:51:54)<Grisnak>and if youw atched, all of our fans would do the same thing
(12:51:58)<Grisnak>cause they knew where all of them were
(12:52:09)<Grisnak>huge pits all the time
(12:52:13)<Grisnak>we would be moshing on stage
(12:52:19)<Grisnak>kickin the shit outta eachother drunk as fuck
(12:52:26)<Grisnak>some of the best moments in my life
(12:52:40)<Grisnak>Played shows with some HUGe bands too
(12:52:47)<Grisnak>Slayer, Cephalic Carnage, Opeth
(12:52:51)<Grisnak>Lamb of God
(12:54:39)<RotateMe>wow, even i know two of them
(12:55:04)<joe6pack>damn
(12:55:10)<RotateMe>yeah that's why i like metal live, but i wouldn't know what to do while listening to it in my room :D
(12:55:17)<joe6pack>cleaning mold out is hard work
(12:55:26)<RotateMe>ido: what?
(12:55:32)<joe6pack>,old
(12:55:34)<Grisnak>eek
(12:55:34)<joe6pack>mold
(12:55:43)<joe6pack>from the bathroom walls
(12:55:43)<Grisnak>Bleach!
(12:55:46)<Grisnak>oh
(12:55:47)<Grisnak>ouch
(12:56:01)<RotateMe>ugh
(12:56:11)<joe6pack>i got some chloride/acid thing
(12:56:19)<joe6pack>but i didn't manage to get it all out
(12:56:33)<joe6pack>but it's better than it was before
(12:57:22)<purestrain>hmm
(12:57:36)<joe6pack>and now my flatmate is going to stink up the toilet, how the hell am i supposed to work under these conditions?
(12:57:53)<joe6pack>it will still be at least another half an hour
(12:57:56)<purestrain>joe6pack, as i gave you my 7drl to test, did you run it within virtual box ?
(12:58:08)<Grisnak>fabreeze man!
(12:58:20)<joe6pack>purestrain: yes, windows xp under vitruaBox
(12:58:20)<greg>you should try pressure washer to clean your bathroom :)
(12:58:41)<joe6pack>i don't have this kind of equipment... 
(12:58:43)<purestrain>hmm... i'm getting the same error
(12:58:59)<RotateMe>i could lend you my sandblaster 
(12:59:05)<purestrain>don't know how to avoid it
(12:59:16)<joe6pack>your hundrets of kilometers away!
(12:59:21)<joe6pack>*you're
(12:59:28)<RotateMe>yeah but you could fire it at your flatmate it would be awesome
(12:59:30)<RotateMe>:D
(12:59:35)<joe6pack>hrm
(12:59:39)<joe6pack>that's an idea
(01:00:10)<RotateMe>is there any function like pow(a,b) where a,b can be ints and the compiler doesn't cry?
(01:00:41)<joe6pack>doesn't that work with the normal one in <math.h>?
(01:01:12)<greg><RotateMe> you have to cast your int into doubles
(01:01:21)<greg>with double(a) 
(01:01:36)<greg>since math.h work with double or float variables
(01:01:45)<joe6pack>yeah double it seems
(01:02:03)<RotateMe>yeah, or to floats i think that's faster isn't it?
(01:02:13)<RotateMe>pow((float)a,b)
(01:02:18)<greg>it depend of the function
(01:02:27)<RotateMe>but it sucks that i have to write it :P
(01:02:40)<greg>write a pow function
(01:02:45)<RotateMe>no, what really sucks is the time it takes for conversion
(01:03:06)<RotateMe>right, i'll do #define pow(a,b) pow((float)a,b)
(01:03:09)<greg>do a loop and multiply you (a) number
(01:03:18)<RotateMe>or that
(01:10:32)<greg>time to go to work, see you later everybody 
(01:18:56)<Grisnak>wooo
(01:19:02)<Grisnak>creating that window was easy
(01:19:06)<Grisnak>2 lines of code
(01:19:07)<Grisnak>huzzah
(01:21:38)<RotateMe>yep
(01:22:18)<RotateMe>the only "hard" thing is to integrate the library when you're using code::blocks the first time
(01:22:36)<RotateMe>but i think this was pretty comfortable too
(01:22:50)<Grisnak>yeah, I just got that all setup
(01:22:52)<Grisnak>wasnt too hard
(01:22:57)<Grisnak>just had to include the one library
(01:23:05)<Grisnak>then put the entire library in my game folder
(01:23:18)<Grisnak>err link the library
(01:23:35)<Grisnak>Oh
(01:23:39)<Grisnak>one sec
(01:23:44)<Grisnak>lemme test somethign before I ask this
(01:25:14)<Grisnak>never mind, I think i got it
(01:25:15)<Grisnak>:P
(01:26:05)<RotateMe>kk, but if you have any questions, just ask, i owe this channel a lot of answers
(01:26:26)<RotateMe>i'm asking noob c++ questions for about a month now, so... ^^
(01:27:24)<Grisnak>hehe
(01:27:32)<Grisnak>Yeah, I just found the loop for the lib
(01:27:38)<Grisnak>hehe
(01:31:28)<Grisnak>oh
(01:31:30)<Grisnak>with that lib
(01:31:40)<Grisnak>i noticed some "..." parts in the code
(01:31:45)<Grisnak>what is that all about?
(01:31:55)<Grisnak>TCODConsole::printLeft(int x, int y, TCOD_bkgnd_flag_t flag, const char *fmt, ...)
(01:31:57)<Grisnak>like that
(01:32:32)<Grisnak>is that what Im going to be drawing to the screen?
(01:32:44)<RotateMe>well, kind of
(01:33:00)<RotateMe>the 'const char *fmt' is a format string
(01:33:11)<RotateMe>that means it can either be a normal string, like "hello world"
(01:33:25)<RotateMe>or it can be something like "hp: %d/%d"
(01:33:38)<Grisnak>ok
(01:33:38)<Grisnak>so
(01:33:48)<RotateMe>those two "%d"'s point to two ints that will follow
(01:33:51)<Grisnak>would I replace that const char with what I want to display?
(01:34:13)<Grisnak>Like Im attempting to draw to the screen "Welcome to my game"
(01:34:17)<Grisnak>in the game window
(01:34:30)<Grisnak>Ive mainly been doing console applications
(01:34:35)<RotateMe>so eg:    TCODConsole::printLeft(0,0,TCOD_BKGND_NONE,"HP: %d/%d",playerHP,playerMaxHP);
(01:34:36)<Grisnak>so the cout << "blah" works
(01:34:54)<Grisnak>Ok
(01:34:57)<Grisnak>lemme mess with this
(01:34:58)<Grisnak>hehe
(01:35:06)<RotateMe>this would draw something like 'HP: 5/10' at the top left corner of the screen
(01:35:23)<RotateMe>%d is for ints, %f is for floats and %s is for string as far as i can remember
(01:35:53)<RotateMe>but just lookup printf() on any reference website, there you will find an explanation about format strings
(01:36:23)<Grisnak>oh ok
(01:36:36)<RotateMe>btw, i always use TCOD_BGKND_NONE, never had a use for the others and i guess it's pretty much what you will want to use for what you're doing
(01:37:37)<RotateMe>x is the x coordinate how you know it from school, but y in programming in most cases refers to the distance from the top of the screen
(01:37:47)<RotateMe>so 0 is the top row
(01:37:59)<Grisnak>yeah
(01:39:53)<Grisnak>TCODConsole::printLeft(0, 0, TCOD_BKGND_NONE, "%s", welcome);
(01:39:55)<Grisnak>ok so that
(01:40:02)<Grisnak>would print on the left side of the screen
(01:40:04)<Grisnak>what I want it to right?
(01:40:21)<Grisnak>Cause I get a stupid error trying to compile it
(01:40:38)<Grisnak>error: cannot call member function `void TCODConsole::printLeft(int, int, TCOD_bkgnd_flag_t, const char*, ...)' without object|
(01:41:05)<Grisnak>I have welcome declared as a string with what it is supposed to say
(01:41:08)<Grisnak>:'(
(01:41:18)<Grisnak>Odds are Im forgetting something stupid
(01:43:02)<RotateMe>yeah that's the OO thing
(01:43:10)<RotateMe>wait a sec
(01:43:20)<Grisnak>kk
(01:43:52)<RotateMe>after you've initialized the console, there's a global static variable inside the TCODConsole class called root
(01:44:08)<RotateMe>root points to the root console on which you will be able to draw
(01:44:14)<RotateMe>to access it you do:
(01:44:24)<RotateMe>TCODConsole::root->printLeft(...)
(01:44:47)<Grisnak>Ok so I put that into my code after I init the console and my stuff should work?
(01:44:48)<Grisnak>:x
(01:44:53)<RotateMe>actually TCODConsole::root is a pointer to a TCODConsole object if that tells you somethingerror: cannot call member function `void TCODConsole::printLeft(int, int, TCOD_bkgnd_flag_t, const char*, ...)' without object|
(01:44:54)<RotateMe><Grisnak> I have welcome declared as a string with what it is supposed to say
(01:44:54)<RotateMe><Grisnak> :'(
(01:44:54)<RotateMe><Grisnak> Odds are Im forgetting something stupid
(01:44:54)<Grisnak>Lol sorry for being super noob
(01:44:57)<RotateMe>woops
(01:45:06)<RotateMe>sry
(01:45:17)<RotateMe>no problem
(01:45:40)<RotateMe>yes to the question above ^^
(01:49:17)<joe6pack>fuck
(01:49:30)<joe6pack>it takes 7 hours to get from vienna to dresden!
(01:49:39)<joe6pack>it's only ~500km away
(01:50:09)<joe6pack>probably becayse of the slow trains in the czech republic
(01:50:32)<RotateMe>heh, that's true i guess
(01:50:46)<RotateMe>you could go overnight
(01:50:54)<joe6pack>could fly as well i guess
(01:51:02)<RotateMe>the sleeping trains are okay, said my sister at least
(01:51:10)<joe6pack>although i don't know if there are cheap flights to dresden
(01:51:19)<RotateMe>me neither
(01:51:41)<RotateMe>btw will you see any game of the europa cup?
(01:51:53)<joe6pack>no
(01:51:58)<RotateMe>or not interested in football like me? :D
(01:51:59)<joe6pack>not a football fan
(01:52:02)<RotateMe>kk
(01:52:35)<RotateMe>my sister told me some bars are actually advertising that they DON'T show football games on tv
(01:54:22)<joe6pack>heh
(01:54:25)<joe6pack>makes sense
(01:54:34)<joe6pack>is she here in austria?
(01:54:42)<RotateMe>in vienna, yes
(01:54:51)<RotateMe>studies psychology
(01:55:06)<rnv>already plenty of drunk, singing fans roaming the streets here
(01:55:21)<joe6pack>yeah
(01:55:45)<joe6pack>at least they don't seem too violent
(01:55:55)<joe6pack>but i hate it :|
(01:56:01)<RotateMe>that's good to hear
(01:56:09)<RotateMe>(that they're no too violent)
(01:56:47)<joe6pack>still would rather have fewer packs of teenagers shouting their lungs out
(01:56:51)<RotateMe>my sister works in a bar where they show the games and i'm worried that she might get hurt when they start beating each other up
(01:57:09)<joe6pack>huh
(01:57:18)<joe6pack>well hopfully it wouldn't come to that
(01:59:25)<RotateMe>yeah, plus bartenders seem to have some kind of immunity in situations like that, so I'm not too worried
(02:06:32)<Grisnak>arg
(02:06:37)<Grisnak>I still cant draw anything to that screen
(02:06:39)<Grisnak>><
(02:33:41)<RotateMe>?
(02:33:53)<RotateMe>what does the compiler say?
(02:34:01)<RotateMe>or doesn't anything appear?
(02:34:21)<RotateMe>you need to do a TCODConsole::root->flush(); after you've finished drawing
(02:34:30)<Grisnak>hmm
(02:34:32)<Grisnak>well
(02:34:37)<Grisnak>it gives me some stupid error
(02:34:43)<Grisnak>compilerer warning really
(02:35:37)<Grisnak>it says, "cannot pass objects of non-POD type 'struct std::string through ...'; call will abort at runtime
(02:35:48)<Grisnak>:/
(02:35:55)<Grisnak>I know its something stupid
(02:35:58)<Grisnak>heh
(02:36:18)<Grisnak>I have a feeling I cant use strings
(02:36:36)<RotateMe>it has something to do with the format string
(02:36:43)<RotateMe>let me see, maybe the %s is wrong
(02:36:50)<RotateMe>post this line again please
(02:36:51)<Grisnak>Ahh
(02:37:05)<Grisnak>TCODConsole::root->printLeft(0, 0, TCOD_BKGND_NONE, "%s",welcome);
(02:37:06)<Grisnak>that?
(02:37:57)<RotateMe>what is welcome?
(02:38:40)<RotateMe>if it's not a variable you need to tell the compiler that this is a string, in order to do that you use "welcome" instead of welcome
(02:38:40)<Grisnak>string welcome = "Hello";
(02:38:48)<RotateMe>oh okay, that should work
(02:39:25)<Grisnak>It doesnt. :'(
(02:39:32)<Grisnak>It just sits at a blank screen
(02:39:41)<Grisnak>it says, "cannot pass objects of non-POD type 'struct std::string through ...'; call will abort at runtime
(02:39:43)<Grisnak>with that eroor
(02:39:45)<Grisnak>error*
(02:39:52)<RotateMe>hmm compiles for me
(02:40:04)<RotateMe>ah oh
(02:40:18)<Grisnak>well, its a warning
(02:40:23)<Grisnak>so it compiles
(02:40:27)<Grisnak>but nothing prints out to the screen
(02:40:27)<RotateMe>after your #include lines add a line saying "using namespace std;"
(02:40:37)<Grisnak>already have it
(02:40:41)<RotateMe>and before that a line "#include <string>"?
(02:40:44)<Grisnak>here lemme post it
(02:40:46)<Grisnak>my code
(02:41:03)<RotateMe>wait use pastebin.org
(02:41:40)<Grisnak>http://rafb.net/p/Ca5nrb48.html
(02:41:47)<Grisnak>I use that.
(02:41:48)<Grisnak>:)
(02:42:31)<RotateMe>strange indentation style :D
(02:42:53)<Grisnak>I deleted some crap
(02:42:57)<Grisnak>im just testing atm
(02:43:15)<Grisnak>not caring about format till I actually get going
(02:43:19)<RotateMe>worked without problems for me
(02:43:28)<Grisnak>and it prints out hello
(02:43:30)<Grisnak>and top left?
(02:43:59)<Grisnak>Hmmm
(02:44:07)<Grisnak>Mebey its cause Im using code::blocks?
(02:44:15)<Grisnak>lemme try dev C++
(02:44:55)<RotateMe>well it closes right after it starts, you should use:
(02:44:55)<RotateMe>  while (!TCODConsole::isWindowClosed()) {
(02:44:55)<RotateMe>  }
(02:45:38)<Grisnak>yeah
(02:45:44)<Grisnak>I was using getch();
(02:45:50)<Grisnak>just to keep it open
(02:48:48)<Grisnak>arg
(02:48:56)<Grisnak>same thing in dev c++
(02:49:03)<Grisnak>same code
(02:49:12)<eMetatoR>that's REALLY strange because it works perfectly for me
(02:50:12)<Grisnak>Hmm
(02:50:14)<Grisnak>what are you using?
(02:51:08)<eMetatoR>god dammit, my connection always crashes when it's raining heavily
(02:51:13)<Grisnak>ha
(02:51:14)<Grisnak>same here
(02:51:19)<eMetatoR>i'm using Visual C++ 2008
(02:51:37)<eMetatoR>the most annoying thing is that I'm still online and can't take my nickname
(02:51:50)<Grisnak>ah
(02:51:51)<Grisnak>that sucks
(02:54:19)<Grisnak>arg
(02:54:23)<Grisnak>and its not staying open
(02:54:24)<Grisnak>ffs
(02:54:31)<Grisnak>im going to download visual c ++
(02:54:33)<Grisnak>arg
(02:54:43)<Grisnak>I hate this crap
(02:54:54)<eMetatoR>well what the error message means is, that "string" is not a valid type to be passed as the "..." in printLeft
(02:54:59)<eMetatoR>but that's just not true...
(02:56:42)<Grisnak>Ok
(02:56:43)<Grisnak>this is odd
(02:56:48)<Grisnak>instead of putting a string
(02:56:51)<Grisnak>i just did an int
(02:56:52)<Grisnak>and it worked
(02:56:55)<Grisnak>!
(02:56:58)<Grisnak>wtf
(02:56:58)<Grisnak>haha
(02:57:09)<eMetatoR>yeah but that's not a solution
(02:57:22)<eMetatoR>and it's not odd, it's exactly what the error was saying
(02:57:35)<eMetatoR>string wasn't valid in this case, but it's supposed to be valid
(02:57:38)<Grisnak>well wait
(02:57:50)<Grisnak>with strings it doesnt accept anything after whitespace right?
(02:58:00)<Grisnak>or mebey %s is wrong?
(02:58:05)<Grisnak>supposed to be something else?
(02:58:26)<eMetatoR>http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdio/printf.html
(02:59:11)<eMetatoR>s	String of characters	sample -> printf ("%s \n", "A string");
(02:59:54)<Grisnak>yeah
(02:59:55)<Grisnak>Hmmmmmmmm
(03:01:40)<eMetatoR>and since string is nothing but a wrapper for a char*, which again is a string of chars it should definitely work
(03:02:18)<eMetatoR>what you can try is weclome.c_str()
(03:02:34)<eMetatoR>TCODConsole::root->printLeft(0, 0, TCOD_BKGND_NONE, "%s",welcome.c_str());
(03:02:35)<Grisnak>It seems to work with everything but strings
(03:02:42)<eMetatoR>try that
(03:03:19)<Grisnak>That worked!
(03:03:35)<Grisnak>so what does the welcome.c_str() do?
(03:04:10)<eMetatoR>okay... well, explanation: string is not one of the basic data types in c/c++, string is a "wrapper" for an array of chars (single letters assembled together)
(03:04:26)<eMetatoR>"%s" seems to be calling for such a char*
(03:04:44)<eMetatoR>string has a method that returns such a char* called c_str()
(03:04:51)<Grisnak>Ahhhhhhhhhhh
(03:05:08)<eMetatoR>but don't ask me why it worked for me
(03:05:13)<Grisnak>So now, if I want to display any strings I would have to put the .c_str() at the end?
(03:05:31)<eMetatoR>yep
(03:05:46)<Grisnak>Okie doke
(03:05:54)<Grisnak>hehe now Im going to get somewhere
(03:05:55)<Grisnak>huzzah
(03:07:25)<RotateMe>eg: char* welcome = "Welcome";
(03:07:34)<RotateMe>haha i got my nick again
(03:07:52)<Grisnak>Oh so I can just declar char* instead of string?
(03:08:21)<Grisnak>woot!
(03:08:22)<Grisnak>that works
(03:08:24)<Grisnak>hehe
(03:08:27)<RotateMe>oops you missed that: <@eMetatoR> but what i would really recommend is that you read a chapter about pointers and strings in a c++ book and use char* instead of strings
(03:08:46)<RotateMe>(i'm loosing connection from time to time)
(03:08:59)<RotateMe>luckily, you can read the log here: http://yehieli.info/rgrd/log.txt
(03:09:12)<RotateMe>because we have a self made bot :D

(03:11:01)<Grisnak>Yeah, I was actually in the middle of reading pointers
(03:11:06)<Grisnak>I read them way earlier
(03:11:13)<Grisnak>cause my buddy said they were important
(03:11:19)<Grisnak>but it made no sence to me
(03:11:21)<Grisnak>:x
(03:12:24)<RotateMe>they are important
(03:12:29)<RotateMe>you'll see soon enough
(03:12:40)<RotateMe>lol @ the Stile source code thread
(03:12:46)<RotateMe>Krice ftw ;)
(03:14:18)<Grisnak>Yeah, I know they are important
(03:14:24)<Grisnak>but they just never made sence to me
(03:14:29)<Grisnak>Ill have to work on them more.
(03:14:39)<Grisnak>I tend to learn by doing
(03:14:46)<Grisnak>so Ill read and try it out
(03:14:52)<Grisnak>then they prob will make sence to me
(03:27:56)<Grisnak>Oh hey, is there a quick little piece of code that I can toss in to hover my mouse over to see the x,y co-ords in the window for quick UI making reference?
(03:28:05)<Grisnak>My buddy did it, but I cant remember how he did
(03:38:08)<eMetatoR>TCOD_mouse_t myMouseStatus = TCODMouse::getStatus();
(03:38:08)<eMetatoR>TCODConsole::root->printLeft(0,0,TCOD_BKGND_NONE,"%d,%d",myMouseStatus.cx,myMouseStatus.cy);
(03:38:13)<eMetatoR>disconnected again :(
(03:38:35)<eMetatoR>that should work, didn't try it though
(03:44:27)<Grisnak>ah cool thanks
(03:47:40)<RotateMe>works?
(03:48:15)<Grisnak>Fantasticly
(03:48:16)<Grisnak>:D
(03:48:25)<Grisnak>Im actually having no probs at all now
(03:48:26)<Grisnak>heheh
(03:48:41)<Grisnak>And you were right, this is amazingly easy to do stuff in
(03:51:29)<RotateMe>yep...
(03:52:06)<RotateMe>but in order to draw your map and chars use setFore(), setBack(), setForegroundColor() and setBackgroundColor()
(03:52:12)<RotateMe>not printLeft() or anything
(03:54:37)<Grisnak>yeah
(03:54:56)<Grisnak>I was just trying to figure out how to print stuff to the screen
(03:55:00)<Grisnak>Im working on an interface atm
(03:56:53)<Grisnak>Oh, I really appreciate all of the help.
(04:35:44)<RotateMe>does anyone know if i can change code of a library, compile my project and just use the old dll file or do i have to recompile the library or something
(04:36:57)<RotateMe>seems i have to recompile the thing :(

(07:27:19)<Aerton>hi
(07:52:41)<Grisnak>hello
(08:58:59)<the_ru>LOL
(08:59:04)<the_ru>Krice is trolling about TSL
(09:00:14)<the_ru>"This is not a personal attack"
(09:01:53)<the_ru>joe6pack: and he even mentions Cryptrover :-)
(09:01:59)<Aerton>do you consider it to be worse than the version number flame?
(09:02:57)<Aerton>apparently this version was not lucky on constructive feedback :/
(09:03:42)<the_ru>I don't give a damn about the version numbers actually
(09:04:16)<the_ru>I use a standard system and explained it, if they want to continue whining about them it's not my problem :-)
(09:04:19)<joe6pack>the_ru: link?
(09:05:18)<the_ru>http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.development/msg/ec47c8321241ef2a
(09:06:01)<joe6pack>o i c
(09:06:17)<joe6pack>i hoped it would be something more interesting... 
(09:06:29)<joe6pack>he basically doesn't like the names
(09:07:19)<Kadwiell>Also, he thinks you're releasing too early
(09:07:22)<Kadwiell>Which is.. pretty ironic
(09:07:44)<joe6pack>i think krice can be safely ignored 
(09:07:45)<the_ru>yes, but it's no use pointing that out :-)
(09:08:50)<the_ru>It's a bit surprising that he tried to pick on me though
(09:09:04)<the_ru>He usually seems to prefer first-time posters
(09:12:48)<the_ru>But no, there hasn't been any constructive feedback so far
(09:13:39)<the_ru>so I guess I didn't miss anything when I didn't announce 0.10-0.11
(09:15:30)<joe6pack>i guess he knows they are more likely to actually respond 
(09:15:41)<joe6pack>where as we'll probably just ignore him
(09:22:50)<the_ru>Heh
(09:22:56)<the_ru>So
(09:23:16)<the_ru>First he complains about me releasing too early, then he releases *alpha* software of his own?
(09:23:19)<the_ru>:-)
(09:24:23)<the_ru>Hm.
(09:24:23)<the_ru>I
(09:24:31)<the_ru>dunno what became of this weekend
(09:24:39)<the_ru>Went to visit a friend, but he was sick most of the time
(09:24:54)<the_ru>so I mostly idled instead
(09:44:38)<joe6pack>heh
(09:44:50)<joe6pack>i watched star gate atlantis all day long...
(09:44:57)<the_ru>!!!
(09:45:05)<the_ru><- huge fan
(09:45:06)<joe6pack>so you couldn't have used your time less wisley than me
(09:45:26)<joe6pack>actually i would have preferred star trek ds9
(09:45:35)<the_ru>I think it would have been better spent that way
(09:45:46)<joe6pack>but tv-links.cc only has a few episodes 
(09:45:54)<the_ru>We've been on the road for 10 hours or so
(09:46:02)<joe6pack>:o
(09:46:16)<joe6pack>he lives that far away?
(09:46:24)<joe6pack>couldn't you call before coming? 
(09:46:33)<joe6pack>would have saved you a lot of time and effort 
(09:46:39)<the_ru>It wasn't all driving, though - we took a break halfway
(09:46:47)<the_ru>well, ~600 km
(09:46:52)<the_ru>and he knew we were coming
(09:47:01)<the_ru>but, we would probably have gone anyway
(09:47:05)<joe6pack>so is that one direction 
(09:47:07)<joe6pack>?
(09:47:08)<the_ru>since my GFs sister also lives there
(09:47:10)<the_ru>yes, one way
(09:47:27)<the_ru>but she, OTOH, sleeps until late in the afternoon
(09:47:36)<the_ru>so we were kind of lonely in the morning
(09:47:59)<joe6pack>well i'm sure you've found a way to amuse yourselves...
(09:48:11)<joe6pack>i mean you weren't alone
(09:48:56)<the_ru>we stopped by my GFs grandmother as well, that had just returned from China
(09:50:06)<the_ru>so how far are you in the series?
(10:02:19)<joe6pack>season 4
(10:02:28)<joe6pack>episode 7 or 8
(10:05:33)<the_ru>ok
(10:05:46)<the_ru>I think the first two seasons were the best
(10:05:54)<the_ru>But I guess that applies to most series
(10:13:50)<joe6pack>it doesn't to some (all?) of the terks
(10:13:53)<joe6pack>*treks
(11:14:33)<the_ru>hm
(11:30:34)<Grisnak>Hellllllooooo
(11:30:42)<the_ru>Hi
(11:36:35)<Grisnak>Whats up?
(11:38:04)<the_ru>the hands on the clock
(11:38:15)<the_ru>they're getting closer and closer to 12

(03:00:41)<RotateMe>okay this is a stupid example, because lightsources can well be at some other place than the player
(03:33:46)<joe6pack>greeting humans
(03:34:00)<joe6pack>i now have nothing to do :(
(03:34:20)<joe6pack>the guy i am doing this project with sent me an email saying he isn't coming
(03:34:30)<joe6pack>he lost his cell phone or something
(03:34:35)<joe6pack>and needs to get a new one
(03:34:39)<joe6pack>or cancel the old one
(03:34:41)<joe6pack>or both
(03:38:43)<RotateMe>what project=
(03:38:52)<RotateMe>s/=/?

(03:39:30)<joe6pack>cool
(03:39:32)<Grisnak>oh nice
(03:39:35)<Grisnak>hey RotateMe
(03:39:35)<Grisnak>:)
(03:39:41)<Grisnak>Sorry I was messin around still
(03:39:42)<Grisnak>hehe
(03:41:34)<RotateMe>can't view that page ido, it seems to be connected to your login session
(03:41:52)<RotateMe>maybe there's a way you can see this as an external?
(03:42:00)<RotateMe>Grisnak: any progress on your game?
(03:42:39)<joe6pack>http://tuwis.tuwien.ac.at/zope/_ZopeId/56895191A3ZeHM3SqlU/tpp/lv/lva_html?num=118144&sem=2008S
(03:42:47)<joe6pack>betteR?
(03:43:10)<Grisnak>Kind of
(03:43:12)<Grisnak>not much really
(03:43:21)<Grisnak>Most of the stuff I try to do
(03:43:23)<Grisnak>doesnt work
(03:43:25)<Grisnak>:/
(03:43:37)<Grisnak>I need alot of experimentation
(03:43:43)<Glowie>What's your project like Grisnak?
(03:43:53)<Grisnak>or some source code to see how some of the stuff works
(03:43:59)<Grisnak>Its going to be an RPG 
(03:44:03)<Grisnak>using the libtcod 
(03:44:16)<Grisnak>Kind of modern day, but alternate univers kinda thing
(03:44:24)<joe6pack>neat
(03:44:29)<Grisnak>More of guns and stuff rather than magic
(03:44:31)<Glowie>Is libtcod ASCII?
(03:44:35)<Grisnak>yea
(03:44:38)<RotateMe>i can provide you my sourcecode, it uses libtcod
(03:44:42)<RotateMe>Glowie: yes
(03:44:46)<Grisnak>That would be awesome
(03:44:52)<RotateMe>just gimme your mail address
(03:44:54)<Grisnak>Thats the best way I learn is by disecting source code
(03:45:02)<Grisnak>cradlefan666@hotmail.com
(03:45:12)<Grisnak>Its also my msn if you wanna add me. :)
(03:45:34)<Grisnak>I was tryin to pick apart the  C++ sample source
(03:45:40)<Grisnak>but it didnt end up workin
(03:45:40)<Grisnak>:(
(03:46:03)<Glowie>The only really hard thing when I was starting my project was the LOS code :O
(03:46:04)<RotateMe>just don't take the way i do thing as an ideal
(03:46:19)<Aerton>is your nickname connected to the orc commander?
(03:46:23)<RotateMe>Glowie: why?
(03:46:39)<Grisnak>No actually
(03:46:40)<Grisnak>well
(03:46:42)<Grisnak>in a sence
(03:46:46)<Grisnak>I got it from a band
(03:46:48)<Grisnak>called Mayhem
(03:46:57)<Grisnak>but the dude I got it from, got it from the orc thing
(03:47:24)<Glowie>Because I was a lot younger, it was my first big project (hence no experience with that kind of stuff) and it felt somehow hard to grasp the idea behind it to write the code yourself
(03:47:40)<Glowie>Cradle of Filth, Grisnak?
(03:48:15)<Grisnak>yeah, when I was younger I was really into them
(03:48:16)<RotateMe>okay, yeah i didn't know how to do it too... bresenham isn't as easy to come up with as one would think
(03:48:22)<Grisnak>Ive just had that email for like 8 years now
(03:48:31)<Glowie>I feel your pain
(03:49:12)<Grisnak>Yeah, atm Im trying to figure out how to get my UI to stay up after I "attempt" to place my '@' character on the main display
(03:49:12)<Glowie>Today I think I could manage to do it by myself, though I'd still find someone else's optimized algorithm to speed up things
(03:49:16)<Grisnak>It fails though.
(03:49:17)<Grisnak>:(
(03:49:30)<Glowie>Is that a libtcod related issue?
(03:50:40)<Grisnak>prob ya
(03:50:50)<Grisnak>But im still a newbie coder so
(03:51:02)<Grisnak>Its more of me being retarded, than libtcod
(03:51:03)<Grisnak>haha
(03:52:25)<RotateMe>it's sending... it's actually > 3mb, i put everything in there including both code::blocks and vc++ project files and debug exe and all that stuff
(03:53:17)<Grisnak>Wow thanks! :D
(03:55:01)<RotateMe>if you have any questions just ask
(03:55:07)<Grisnak>Will do.
(03:55:08)<Grisnak>:)
(03:55:24)<RotateMe>i guess char.cpp might be interesting
(03:55:32)<Grisnak>I might be ok after I peek into the source code of another RL
(03:55:41)<RotateMe>some parts are pretty well commented, others aren't
(03:55:49)<Grisnak>Okie doke
(03:55:59)<RotateMe>if you're able to compile it, the first step is done :D
(03:56:18)<TMCGone>that's the hardest step normally :(
(03:56:33)<Grisnak>ehheh
(03:56:34)<TMCGone>wish I could get this math library to work
(03:56:43)<Grisnak>Well, mine compiles pretty well
(03:56:47)<RotateMe>it doesn't?
(03:57:05)<TMCGone>sin(0.0039309) == 5.9865002e-008
(03:57:13)<Grisnak>I generally get it to where I can compile it with atleast one feature, then build from there.
(03:58:06)<RotateMe>TMCGone: did you check radian measure vs degree measure?
(03:59:07)<joe6pack>urm... sin(0) is 0
(03:59:17)<joe6pack>what's the problem?\
(03:59:44)<Aerton>sin(x) = x for very small x (approximately)
(03:59:56)<joe6pack>yea, they are both about 0
(04:02:16)<TMCGone>wait...
(04:02:35)<joe6pack>http://www.google.com/search?q=sin%280.0039309+degrees%29
(04:02:44)<TMCGone>this is suspicious
(04:03:00)<RotateMe>:D
(04:04:11)<TMCGone>kind of close
(04:04:19)<TMCGone>only 3 rders of magnitude out
(04:06:21)<Aerton>are these usual float numbers, or some kind with reduced precision?
(04:06:35)<RotateMe>let me guess, you needed the sin function to calculate a rocket attack launch that hit joe6pack...
(04:06:53)<RotateMe>it's obvious, there's no other reason for an eof from client
(04:07:38)<TMCGone>single precision
(04:08:10)<TMCGone>it's a vecotr math library, written using SSE and MMX by intrinsic gcc functions
(04:09:03)<TMCGone>if I hit ido, with results like this I must have been aiming for saturn
(04:09:23)<joe6pack>TMCGone: floats just aren't accurate in that order of magnitude 
(04:09:41)<joe6pack>they are both practically 0
(04:10:00)<Aerton>regular floats are good enough
(04:10:08)<Aerton>I guess SSE have a lesser precision
(04:10:18)<TMCGone>SSE uses single precision only
(04:10:30)<TMCGone>(SSE2 and later have doubles)
(04:10:54)<TMCGone>but only the number of significant bits should matter, not the magniture
(04:10:57)<TMCGone>magnitude
(04:13:23)<TMCGone>I think it's probably a gcc bug
(04:13:56)<TMCGone>especially since the library webpage documents a bug with my version of gcc
(04:14:23)<TMCGone>but it has a builtin workaround for that bug
(04:14:30)<TMCGone>(without the workaround, gcc crashes)
(04:14:45)<the_ru>Hi
(04:15:27)<the_ru>let's see how well it works on a machine that's ~800 MHz below the recommended specs :-)
(04:15:45)<the_ru>I have more memory and a decent graphics card though
(04:15:46)<Grisnak>lol
(04:19:12)<RotateMe>grisnak: did you try the game?
(04:19:26)<RotateMe>what's your framerate? (the small white number on the lower right)
(04:19:33)<joe6pack>scorch2000.com anyone?
(04:20:05)<joe6pack>i have nothing better to do :(
(04:20:40)<Grisnak>Yeah I did
(04:20:43)<Grisnak>Um lemme check
(04:20:47)<Grisnak>60 fps
(04:20:55)<joe6pack>come on guys
(04:21:05)<Grisnak>goes from 60-63
(04:21:28)<RotateMe>shit
(04:21:35)<RotateMe>should be 66
(04:21:43)<RotateMe>joe i have opened up a game
(04:21:55)<RotateMe>or do you want?
(04:22:00)<Grisnak>60 fps is still great
(04:22:01)<Grisnak>imo
(04:22:02)<RotateMe>i have no idea about this game :d
(04:22:03)<the_ru>DO NOT WANT
(04:22:04)<the_ru>:-)
(04:22:12)<joe6pack>password?
(04:22:20)<RotateMe>60 fps is still okay but what cpu do you have?
(04:22:27)<the_ru>yeah, what difference does it make if it's 60 or 66?
(04:22:34)<TMCGone>hmm, play, or go to bed?
(04:22:38)<joe6pack>what's the game password RotateMe?\
(04:22:39)<joe6pack>paly
(04:22:41)<RotateMe>could you open a game plz
(04:22:42)<joe6pack>play
(04:22:44)<joe6pack>yes
(04:22:47)<RotateMe>k
(04:22:53)<Grisnak>I have a celeron D 3.2 ghz
(04:23:04)<TMCGone>whaaaat

(04:23:12)<TMCGone>how can the requirement be 4.0GHz?
(04:23:23)<Grisnak>:/
(04:23:24)<RotateMe>it shouldn't be
(04:23:26)<TMCGone>I thought only lastgen pentium 4 hit 4GHz?
(04:23:32)<joe6pack>are you joining?
(04:23:39)<TMCGone>ok, I'll play
(04:23:48)<joe6pack>and RotateMe?

(04:29:05)<joe6pack>do it quick, i don't know how long we can wait
(04:29:05)<TMC>"AMD also added 2 new SSE instructions that it named SSE4a. These instructions are not found in Intel's processors supporting SSE4.1 and alternatively AMD processors are not supporting Intel's SSE4.1."

(04:32:12)<joe6pack>what does it say?
(04:32:19)<joe6pack>should we start with only us 3?
(04:32:28)<RotateMe>yep let's just try it
(04:32:33)<Grisnak>It says connection to server failed
(04:32:36)<Grisnak>after I try to log in
(04:32:50)<RotateMe>you chose the truck too
(04:32:51)<joe6pack>tmc you're up
(04:32:53)<TMC>alright, I've played this ocne before...
(04:35:20)<Grisnak>ok I cant play guys
(04:35:23)<Grisnak>I cant seem to log in
(04:35:24)<Grisnak>:(
(04:35:26)<Grisnak>Sorry
(04:36:12)<TMC>even if you specific a random game password?
(04:36:24)<TMC>to start a new game
(04:36:55)<Grisnak>Its right after the log in
(04:37:02)<Grisnak>I cant log into the site to even see servers
(04:38:08)<RotateMe>that's strange
(04:38:27)<Grisnak>Yeah
(04:38:59)<joe6pack>hrm
(04:38:59)<TMC>:oo
(04:39:11)<joe6pack>you sure you aren't just doing something wrong?
(04:39:27)<Grisnak>Ive tried several tiems
(04:39:28)<TMC>where can you see servers?
(04:39:31)<Grisnak>including trying to as a guest
(04:39:36)<Grisnak>No Idea
(04:39:42)<Grisnak>After it askes me to log in
(04:39:43)<Grisnak>which I do
(04:39:50)<Grisnak>it says that I cannot connect to server
(04:39:51)<Grisnak>then boots me
(04:40:09)<Aerton>check your firewall
(04:40:48)<Grisnak>its off
(04:42:00)<joe6pack>try starting a game
(04:42:29)<Grisnak>I cant
(04:42:34)<Grisnak>it doesnt even start the game up for me.
(04:42:51)<Grisnak>As soon as I log in, it says connection to server failed
(04:42:56)<Grisnak>and exits back to the main screen
(05:17:12)<joe6pack>wtf?
(05:17:55)<TMC>:(:(:(

(05:18:15)<joe6pack>\why did i commit suicide?
(05:18:29)<RotateMe>you did?
(05:18:36)<joe6pack>you didn't shoot me did you?
(05:18:42)<RotateMe>TMC did
(05:18:46)<joe6pack>oh really?
(05:18:48)<RotateMe>straight shot in teh head
(05:19:03)<joe6pack>i thought i spontaneously combusted 
(05:19:09)<TMC>you exploded into pretty fireworks
(05:19:14)<RotateMe>:D
(05:19:15)<TMC>it was a heart warming scene
(05:19:37)<joe6pack>:(
(05:19:44)<RotateMe>again?
(05:19:46)<joe6pack>sure
(05:19:48)<TMC>ok
(05:19:51)<joe6pack>no eind this time
(05:19:54)<joe6pack>*no wind
(05:19:59)<RotateMe>hmm okay
(05:20:03)<RotateMe>you host again
(05:20:15)<joe6pack>same password
(05:20:18)<joe6pack>somegame
(05:20:27)<joe6pack>Grisnak: try now maybe?
(05:20:54)<joe6pack>go?
(05:20:56)<RotateMe>k
(05:21:17)<Grisnak>hold on
(05:21:22)<Grisnak>in the middle of something
(05:25:06)<joe6pack>deveah: want to play scorched earth?
(05:25:15)<joe6pack>scorch2000.com
(05:27:24)<deveah>hi ido
(05:27:26)<deveah>wait
(05:28:01)<deveah>sure
(05:28:17)<joe6pack>when we finish this one then
(05:28:21)<joe6pack>in the middle currently
(05:28:32)<TMC>we could restart
(05:28:39)<joe6pack>nah i'm winning
(05:28:42)<TMC>since we just finished a subround
(05:28:45)<TMC>shh
(05:28:48)<TMC>I say we restart
(05:28:57)<TMC>what do you say RotateMe
(05:29:18)<RotateMe>what up?
(05:29:24)<joe6pack>restart?
(05:29:27)<joe6pack>for deveah?
(05:29:31)<RotateMe>ah okay
(05:29:35)<joe6pack>:(
(05:29:41)<RotateMe>i had 1 dollar more
(05:29:47)<RotateMe>anyway :D
(05:30:01)<joe6pack>go
(05:30:08)<joe6pack>password: somegame
(05:30:11)<deveah>so how do we play?
(05:30:22)<joe6pack>you will see
(05:30:24)<deveah>found
(05:30:25)<joe6pack>it is simple
(05:38:48)<deveah>it's a pretty nice game
(05:39:25)<deveah>can you change your type of bomb
(05:39:26)<deveah>?
(05:40:10)<deveah>nice
(05:40:14)<deveah>again!
(05:40:14)<RotateMe>you can buy more stuff
(05:40:49)<deveah>i *still* have a nice position!
(05:41:01)<TMC>wow I went from horrible aim to awesome
(05:50:28)<deveah>finallly i do something
(05:50:43)<deveah>now that's a good pos - anyone can shoot me now
(05:52:54)<joe6pack>join us Aerton 
(05:55:36)<TMC>haha
(05:56:15)<Aerton>I only get 'create new game' window
(05:57:30)<RotateMe>yeah problem is that you can only join during a new game
(06:00:45)<RotateMe>last round
(06:01:16)<joe6pack>soon Aerton 
(06:01:44)<TMC>last round?
(06:01:51)<TMC>I should have bought a nuke :(
(06:03:11)<deveah>i have a baby nuke
(06:09:29)<deveah>but doesn't do shit
(06:10:21)<joe6pack>why didn't you use the baby nuke?
(06:12:29)<joe6pack>ok
(06:12:34)<deveah>NO NO NO
(06:12:37)<joe6pack>now Aerton can join
(06:12:40)<RotateMe>i had one?
(06:12:42)<RotateMe>shit

(06:12:47)<deveah>i'll
(06:12:49)<TMC>no I won >: (
(06:12:55)<RotateMe>yep
(06:13:00)<joe6pack>what? it was over
(06:13:02)<joe6pack>5 rounds
(06:13:05)<RotateMe>8 kills, that was awesome
(06:13:05)<TMC>that was the last round
(06:13:12)<deveah>how do i start a new game?
(06:13:15)<joe6pack>who creates 
(06:13:22)<RotateMe>why not you?
(06:13:26)<deveah>i'll do it
(06:13:30)<RotateMe>okay
(06:13:32)<joe6pack>i already did
(06:13:33)<Aerton>I don't see a list of games - only 'create new game' window
(06:13:47)<joe6pack>Aerton: join "somegame"
(06:13:53)<RotateMe>so we join somegame again?
(06:13:54)<RotateMe>okay
(06:14:08)<TMC>type that as the game password
(06:14:16)<joe6pack>come on
(06:14:44)<joe6pack>startr
(06:14:46)<joe6pack>start
(06:17:42)<TMC>:(:(
(06:18:55)<joe6pack>i invited him back
(06:20:35)<Aerton>pure luck
(06:20:53)<joe6pack>why can't i chat
(06:26:25)<Aerton>how many rounds there are?
(06:26:37)<TMC>5.
(06:41:26)<TMC>good one
(06:41:49)<RotateMe>damn you
(06:41:50)<deveah>why does ido keep kicking rotateme?
(06:42:36)<joe6pack>he called me a blind cow
(06:43:45)<joe6pack>damn can;t chat again
(06:48:16)<RotateMe>don't shop so long guys
(06:48:18)<RotateMe>;)
(06:48:24)<RotateMe>it won't help
(06:48:32)<joe6pack>yeah get going already 
(06:48:44)<joe6pack>real men don't shop
(06:59:35)<joe6pack>doner
(06:59:37)<TMC>that was the final round?
(06:59:40)<joe6pack>i'm out of here
(06:59:40)<RotateMe>dammit i couldn't read it
(06:59:43)<deveah>i always win when the game is over
(06:59:45)<joe6pack>i was last place,,,
(06:59:46)<RotateMe>who won?
(06:59:56)<deveah>i was 4/5
(07:00:01)<deveah>again?
(07:00:02)<TMC>didn't see
(07:00:10)<RotateMe>:(
(07:00:10)<deveah>tmc did i think
(07:00:13)<TMC>I had 4 kills
(07:00:15)<RotateMe>gotta walk the dog now
(07:00:19)<TMC>I didn't
(07:00:21)<RotateMe>i had more i think
(07:00:31)<Aerton>someone got 7 or 1st place
(07:00:34)<Aerton>*on
(07:00:40)<deveah>let's play again
(07:00:43)<RotateMe_dog>and that doesn't mean i'm a dog or something
(07:00:51)<Aerton>sure it does!
(07:01:01)<TMC>cthulhu_nz
(07:01:35)<Aerton>once more?
(07:01:44)<deveah>i go master now
(07:01:55)<deveah>10 rounds
(07:02:07)<TMC>noo
(07:02:34)<deveah>5 then
(07:02:38)<deveah>"somegame" pass
(07:02:42)<TMC>...what about wind?
(07:02:46)<Aerton>the ones doing good in the beginning will have too much advantage for the rest in such a long match
(07:03:11)<deveah>i'l give 999999999 cash to everybody
(07:03:19)<deveah>what's lamermode?
(07:03:33)<Aerton>everyone will use nukes all the time
(07:03:44)<deveah>-999999999 then
(07:03:45)<Aerton>if you give that much
(07:03:50)<Aerton>minus?
(07:03:54)<Aerton>)
(07:03:56)<Aerton>cruel
(07:04:01)<deveah>yep - only missiles this time
(07:04:05)<deveah>win or not
(07:04:18)<TMC>you cna do that?
(07:04:30)<deveah>come on, are you joining?
(07:04:42)<deveah>i only see myself in the Game Options window
(07:05:02)<Aerton>can't join
(07:05:09)<deveah>somegame?
(07:05:18)<TMC>neither
(07:05:39)<deveah>try now
(07:05:58)<deveah>okay
(07:07:55)<TMC>nope
(07:08:52)<deveah>i was dueling w/aerton
(07:08:55)<deveah>join now
(07:09:00)<deveah>somegame
(07:10:04)<deveah>joe6pack
(07:10:08)<deveah>are you joining?
(07:10:14)<TMC>[05:06] <joe6pack> doner
(07:10:15)<joe6pack>no
(07:10:26)<TMC>maybe he meant dinner, or maybe he meant done
(07:10:44)<deveah>anybody else or just us three?
(07:11:51)<deveah>i'll take that as an "us 3 only"
(07:15:05)<deveah>i win!
(07:35:18)<Aerton>I lost!
(07:35:25)<deveah>second, yay
(07:35:32)<deveah>semi-yay
(07:36:49)<deveah>tell me if you want to play again
(07:37:03)<TMC>im going to bed
(07:55:55)<jomiolto>hmm, found somewhat recent Slashdot article with comments from John Carmack
(08:13:34)<Glowie>How can you be sure it's not a fake Carmack?
(08:14:51)<Aerton>the real one have an account on /.
(08:15:36)<Aerton>there was fun moment when someone accused him of not knowing opengl :)
(08:17:18)<Glowie>Haha
(08:17:27)<Glowie>Link to either of the articles (or is it the same?)
(08:17:44)<Aerton>that was years ago
(08:17:48)<Glowie>Oh
(08:17:49)<Aerton>I'll try to find it
(08:17:52)<Glowie>I don't read Slashdot
(08:21:26)<purestrain>http://retroforge.de/~md/googles2.jpg <- me with my new bike googles =D
(08:24:01)<Glowie>You bad ass :P
(08:24:14)<Glowie>or badass*
(08:24:31)<RotateMe>show a pic of your crazy mountainbike
(08:25:03)<purestrain>its not as good looking as i am
(08:25:05)<purestrain>:P
(08:25:14)<RotateMe>^^
(08:27:49)<Aerton>can't find that post, but here is his account http://slashdot.org/~John+Carmack/
(08:53:04)<Grish|Coding>Weeee
(08:53:06)<Grish|Coding>I has + o
(08:53:08)<Grish|Coding>huzzah
(09:18:13)<jomiolto>any irssi wizards here? what does the second to last column in /who output mean? (the number)
(09:19:09)<jomiolto>I'm asking because everyone else on this channel is a 3, while I'm a 0 :P
(09:19:29)<joe6pack>you are a 3 when i do it
(09:19:35)<joe6pack>0 is probably yourself 
(09:19:38)<jomiolto>hmm, interesting
(09:20:01)<jomiolto>nope, can't be that, because on other channels I get 0's, 2's and 3's randomly
(09:21:06)<jomiolto>I wonder if it's something to do with IRC servers...
(09:21:35)<jomiolto>could be that 0 = the same irc server you're on, and the other numbers mean something else (distance between the different servers?)
(09:23:30)<jomiolto>I believe I must embark upon a quest to find out this mystery
(09:23:35)<jomiolto>:P
(09:27:27)<jomiolto>yay, I found it "How many servers away the nick are. (hopcount, also see 4.1.5)"
(09:27:30)<jomiolto>so I guessed right
(09:28:04)<jomiolto>now, where's my reward for completing the quest? :|
(09:28:34)<jomiolto>\o/
(09:29:41)<joe6pack>i'll demote you so that i could promote you again as a reward 
(09:29:55)<jomiolto>:D
(09:29:56)<joe6pack>there you go
(09:30:36)<jomiolto>an extra intelligence point would have been more appropriate, I think, but what the heck. I'll gladly take what I'm given :)

(11:42:41)<TMC>nope, I'm working on a strange attractor renderer
(11:44:53)<greg>you can try to use your compiler sse option, it can speed up your app :)

(11:47:13)<greg>hi
(11:50:25)<TMC>but the compiler doesn't have a SSE vector sine function

(01:11:05)<Glowie>What does libtcod even provide?
(01:11:31)<Grish|Coding>lots of stuffs
(01:11:37)<Grish|Coding>you would have to see it

(01:13:52)<Grish|Coding>yeah
(01:13:55)<Glowie>I prefer good ol' plain console :P
(01:14:06)<Grish|Coding>I always have all these stupid little probs
(01:14:13)<Grish|Coding>And  Ijust cant seem to figr it out
(01:14:26)<Glowie>There's no documentation?
(01:14:44)<Grish|Coding>well kinda
(01:15:04)<Grish|Coding>it doesnt have an answer to what I need.
(01:15:05)<Grish|Coding>:/
(01:15:32)<Glowie>:<
(01:15:58)<Grish|Coding>heh
(01:16:11)<Grish|Coding>I try to dissect some code written already
(01:16:17)<Grish|Coding>but I always end up screwing something up.
(01:17:08)<Glowie>It doesn't draw correctly or?
(01:17:13)<TMC>lol
(01:17:43)<TMC>-O3 turns my 7 lines of assmebly instructions into 70
(01:18:48)<Grish|Coding>OH I GOT IT
(01:18:49)<Grish|Coding>CHEA
(01:18:58)<Grish|Coding>well
(01:18:59)<Grish|Coding>sorta
(01:19:03)<Grish|Coding>doesnt move
(01:19:06)<Grish|Coding>BUT I SEE HIM!
(01:24:20)<TMC>ok, I'm 4 times faster than without vectorization
(01:25:23)<TMC>but, annoyingly, using O3 is important to get full speed out of it
(01:27:10)<Glowie>What's -03?
(01:28:07)<TMC>maximum optimisations
(01:28:33)<TMC>causes massive code size bloat due to rampant inlining
(01:28:44)<TMC>executable size, I mean
(01:30:08)<Glowie>Okie
(01:30:14)<Glowie>What are you trying to super optimize?
(01:31:36)<TMC>a tight iteration loop
(01:31:52)<TMC>x = sinf(a * y_old) - cosf(b * x_old);
(01:31:53)<TMC>y = sinf(c * x_old) - cosf(d * y_old);
(01:32:48)<Glowie>Is it part of something bigger?
(01:33:37)<TMC>that's the Clifford strange attractor
(01:33:43)<TMC>this is a program which draws it
(01:33:54)<TMC>it's someone else's program, I'm just modifying it
(01:34:02)<Glowie>Okay
(01:34:13)<TMC>opps
(01:34:21)<TMC>no, its the De Jong attractor

(05:03:22)<RotateMe>hey, what's up?
(05:03:28)<Grish|Coding>Just a few questions.
(05:03:34)<RotateMe>k no problem
(05:03:38)<Grish|Coding>I assume that you can help with. :)
(05:03:57)<Grish|Coding>First, after I create an offscreen console, for my inventory
(05:04:01)<Grish|Coding>how do I get it to go away?
(05:04:09)<Grish|Coding>LIke you did on your skill menu thing
(05:04:15)<Grish|Coding>Mine just sits there.
(05:04:18)<Grish|Coding>:(
(05:04:20)<RotateMe>wait i'll look
(05:04:24)<Grish|Coding>kk
(05:04:31)<RotateMe>delete i'd guess but i'll look
(05:04:38)<Grish|Coding>I tried that
(05:04:48)<Grish|Coding>but when I put an if statement
(05:04:56)<TMC2>libtcod?
(05:04:57)<Grish|Coding>saying if this key is presses kill the window
(05:05:01)<Grish|Coding>it dont work
(05:05:01)<Grish|Coding>ya
(05:05:02)<Grish|Coding>libtcod
(05:05:44)<Grish|Coding>Ive been trying to get it to go away for a day now.
(05:05:53)<Grish|Coding>I stopped trying and started messing with other stuff
(05:05:54)<Grish|Coding>haha
(05:06:34)<RotateMe>that's interesting :D
(05:06:44)<RotateMe>didn't even think about how to get it away
(05:06:52)<Grish|Coding>hehe
(05:06:58)<RotateMe>i just don't flush it anymore
(05:07:04)<Grish|Coding>Hmmmm
(05:07:13)<RotateMe>eeeeh blit()
(05:07:19)<RotateMe>i don't blit it anymore
(05:07:23)<Grish|Coding>how do you stop blit ing it?
(05:07:45)<Grish|Coding>i tried changing the 3rd value from 255 to 0
(05:07:47)<RotateMe>well ... just don't use the blit command anymore
(05:07:49)<Grish|Coding>and that didnt work either
(05:07:50)<Grish|Coding>Oh
(05:07:52)<Grish|Coding>Hmmmm
(05:08:01)<deveah>some games are impossible
(05:08:18)<deveah>Half-Life: Uplink is one of them
(05:08:28)<TMC2>haha roof resistance
(05:08:33)<TMC2>is that the HL demo?
(05:08:44)<TMC2>I've played it... now did I finish it?
(05:09:04)<Glowie>Grish, just have a flag bool invOpen;, if(invOpen) blitInv();?
(05:09:30)<RotateMe>Glowie: just was about to type that :D
(05:09:35)<Glowie>:>
(05:09:40)<RotateMe>right...
(05:09:57)<TMC2>I guess I didn't finish it, but I'm an extrememly lazy player
(05:09:59)<RotateMe>than set invOpen to true when i is pressed and to false when esc is pressed
(05:10:12)<TMC2>I've never finished HL, even though I often play it online
(05:10:22)<Glowie>Out of curiosity, how long have you been programming Grish? :P
(05:10:25)<Grish|Coding>oh okie doke
(05:10:30)<Grish|Coding>And about a month or so
(05:10:33)<Grish|Coding>but like every day
(05:10:35)<Grish|Coding>all day
(05:10:37)<Glowie>Okie
(05:10:54)<Grish|Coding>its mainly probs with libtcod
(05:10:56)<Grish|Coding>hehh
(05:10:57)<deveah>who wants to play Scorched Earth?
(05:11:11)<Glowie>Sounds like general game programming problem to me, that stopping to blit

(08:09:38)<deveah>tomorrow maybe
(08:10:01)<joe6pack>confirm plz
(08:10:04)<joe6pack>next round
(09:07:18)<the_ru>Hm hm
(09:07:37)<jomiolto>hum hom
(09:10:05)<the_ru>mine are currently called attributes, but I will rename them traits
(09:11:11)<the_ru>I dunno if I should have any generic attributes though
(09:11:14)<the_ru>or just skills
(09:11:40)<the_ru>skills, resistances, binary intrinsics
(09:12:31)<the_ru>right now my skills are just positive modifiers to a positive/negative attribute
(09:13:58)<Glowie>Points in the plane are each colored with one of three colors: red, green, or blue. Prove that, for a given distance d, there always exist two points of the same color at the distance d from each other.
(09:14:56)<joe6pack>uhh
(09:14:56)<the_ru>How many points are there?
(09:15:04)<joe6pack>countably many
(09:15:22)<joe6pack>or wait
(09:15:27)<Glowie>The plane is infinitely big
(09:15:29)<joe6pack>uncountably many
(09:15:42)<joe6pack>size of R^2
(09:15:57)<joe6pack>i assume the plane is question is R^2?
(09:16:08)<Glowie>I'm afraid I don't know what that notation means :<
(09:16:11)<the_ru>what is R?
(09:16:16)<joe6pack>real numbers
(09:16:24)<Glowie>Nothing complex here
(09:16:26)<Glowie>Plain geometry
(09:16:30)<the_ru>|R
(09:16:38)<joe6pack>yes
(09:16:40)<Glowie>|R is more familiar
(09:16:48)<joe6pack>no good ascii representation of it
(09:16:57)<Glowie>Yeah
(09:17:03)<the_ru>but |R means something else to us C programmers :-)
(09:17:10)<Glowie>:P
(09:17:21)<joe6pack>http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/a/69a45f1e602cd2b2c2e67e41811fd226.png
(09:17:31)<the_ru>hm
(09:17:31)<joe6pack>this one to the power of 2
(09:17:39)<the_ru>what do you get if you multiply two sets?
(09:17:43)<the_ru>cartesian product?
(09:18:07)<joe6pack>in this case yes
(09:18:57)<joe6pack>Glowie: i used to love these kinds of problems
(09:19:07)<Glowie>I had fun solving it
(09:19:17)<Glowie>Not that hard though, but I hear it's harder with 4 colors
(09:19:43)<the_ru>does the distribution of the colors matter?
(09:19:46)<joe6pack>oh i have it
(09:19:53)<joe6pack>no
(09:19:56)<Glowie>The distribution can be anything at all
(09:19:58)<joe6pack>it's simple
(09:19:59)<Glowie>So no
(09:20:38)<joe6pack>assume there is such distance d for which there are no such points of the same color
(09:20:41)<the_ru>a-ha, I misunderstood. I thought it had to be a triangle with 3 points, d from each other
(09:21:09)<Glowie>Well you'll get to that situation eventually in your proof :P
(09:21:14)<joe6pack>then look at the circle with radius d
(09:24:57)<Glowie>Yeah joe has it
(09:30:18)<joe6pack>Glowie: saying it's harder for 4 colors is a bit of an understatement...
(09:30:25)<Glowie>True :P
(09:31:21)<joe6pack>Hadwiger‚ÄìNelson problem
(09:32:17)<joe6pack>i knew it sounded familiar 
(09:32:29)<joe6pack>from somewhere... ;)
(09:32:45)<Glowie>Hehe
(09:33:30)<joe6pack>damn i havn't thought of that for years
(09:33:38)<joe6pack>when i was younger i tried to solve it
(09:33:49)<joe6pack>maybe 6 years ago or so
(09:34:38)<Grish|Coding>hi
(09:35:06)<Glowie>I think I won't even try wasting my time with it
(09:35:18)<joe6pack>well who knows...
(09:35:35)<joe6pack>you might succeed where erdos falied :)
(09:36:06)<Glowie>Was he a great mathematician?
(09:36:13)<joe6pack>:o
(09:36:33)<joe6pack>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd≈ës
(09:36:40)<Glowie>I don't really know a lot about maths history or backgrounds of the problems :<
(09:36:59)<joe6pack>he was one of the best known mathematicians of our time
(09:38:20)<Glowie>Cool
(09:38:30)<joe6pack>"Other idiosyncratic elements of Erd≈ës' vocabulary include: children were referred to as "epsilons""
(09:40:36)<Glowie>Luckily for the kids, he never got any
(09:41:11)<joe6pack>unfortunate for the world, though... 
(09:41:36)<jomiolto>"His working style has been humorously compared to traversing a linked list." :)
(09:42:19)<Glowie>:P
(09:42:22)<joe6pack>hah
(09:42:25)<joe6pack>never heard of than
(09:42:28)<joe6pack>*that
(09:42:35)<joe6pack>that's a great quote
(09:44:09)<jomiolto>that wikipedia page has plenty of funny things in it
(09:44:22)<joe6pack>yeah because of its subject
(09:45:41)<joe6pack>i wish i was talented/motivated/smart enough to actually work on such problems for a living
(09:46:23)<joe6pack>as it is i can barely finish my masters, it's already getting way over my head
(09:46:54)<joe6pack>but i'm going to finish it, at the very least
(09:47:07)<joe6pack>i have so little left
(09:47:58)<jomiolto>well, that's fine. couple of times I've managed to construct proofs for some maths assignments without understanding the proof nor what I'm proving, yet the proof was still correct :P
(09:48:21)<Glowie>Haha
(09:49:33)<joe6pack>i'm afraid i will have to amuse myself with lesser pursuits such as programming 
(09:49:39)<joe6pack>at least it pays well
(10:08:43)<the_ru>Hm hm
(10:08:51)<the_ru>someone is yelling
(10:08:57)<the_ru>must have something to do with soccer
(10:12:32)<joe6pack>konijn!
(10:12:56)<joe6pack>haven't seen you here in
(10:12:57)<joe6pack>well
(10:12:59)<joe6pack>a log time
(10:13:02)<joe6pack>*long
(10:13:12)<konijn_nyt>yeah
(10:13:25)<konijn_nyt>new routers -> lost blocked ports
(10:13:29)<konijn_nyt>-> muhahah
(10:13:38)<konijn_nyt>this is a glitch of course
(10:13:42)<konijn_nyt>will be fixed in due time
(10:33:04)<the_ru>Hm
(10:33:04)<the_ru>I
(10:33:14)<the_ru>I wonder how few skills I can get away with
(10:33:22)<the_ru>and still have an interesting, varying game
(10:35:20)<joe6pack>what do you have now?
(10:35:33)<the_ru>too much
(10:35:35)<the_ru>8 attributes
(10:35:37)<joe6pack>(need to steal idea)
(10:35:49)<konijn_nyt>skills or attributes ?
(10:35:52)<the_ru>that are modified by ~20 skills
(10:35:58)<konijn_nyt>ah, ok
(10:36:04)<the_ru>they're not all implemented though
(10:36:08)<joe6pack>list them
(10:36:10)<joe6pack>plz
(10:37:02)<the_ru>  attr_strength,
(10:37:02)<the_ru>  attr_vitality,
(10:37:02)<the_ru>  attr_speed,
(10:37:02)<the_ru>  attr_accuracy,
(10:37:02)<the_ru>  attr_dodge,
(10:37:04)<the_ru>  attr_mind,
(10:37:07)<the_ru>  attr_perception,
(10:37:09)<the_ru>  attr_stealth,
(10:37:38)<joe6pack>and the skills?
(10:37:58)<the_ru> attr_s_blades,  attr_s_poles,  attr_s_axes, attr_s_blunt, attr_s_whips,  attr_s_archery, attr_s_throw, attr_s_exotic, attr_s_unarmed,  attr_s_fire,  attr_s_cold, attr_s_poison, attr_s_enchantment, attr_s_conjuration, attr_s_illusion,  attr_s_traps, attr_s_lockpicking
(10:38:07)<joe6pack>(i think you can easily remove some of these, if they work the way i think they do)
(10:38:09)<the_ru>the magic and rogue skills don't do much yet
(10:38:16)<the_ru>yes, probably
(10:38:35)<the_ru>I would like to only have skills, and no base attributes
(10:38:42)<joe6pack>ok
(10:38:48)<the_ru>to encourage skill building
(10:39:01)<the_ru>instead of picking the most generic attribute
(10:39:14)<joe6pack>well you can just keep the attribute more or less static and allow only increasing of skills
(10:39:17)<joe6pack>like fallout
(10:39:32)<the_ru>yes, but why have them at all
(10:39:45)<joe6pack>hrm
(10:39:48)<joe6pack>i like it, 
(10:39:58)<the_ru>anyway, I can remove most of the skills
(10:39:59)<joe6pack>to give me a general picture of my character
(10:40:00)<the_ru>eh
(10:40:02)<the_ru>attributes, I mean
(10:40:07)<joe6pack>i.e. "strong & stupid"
(10:40:16)<the_ru>vitality, for example, just controls the regeneration rate
(10:40:17)<joe6pack>or "cunning but slow"
(10:40:42)<joe6pack>i think you should think not only on the game mechanics 
(10:40:57)<the_ru>well, with the proper skill set, you should be able to get that picture as well
(10:41:09)<joe6pack>but on how these things effect the player's mental image of the game/character
(10:41:20)<joe6pack>yes but there are too many skills for that
(10:41:59)<joe6pack>i would say use attributes for a rough draft of what the char is all about and do the fine tuning with the skills 
(10:42:26)<joe6pack>or at least that's how i look at things when i play a game
(10:42:34)<joe6pack>that has that kind of system
(10:43:00)<joe6pack>the attributes for the base
(10:43:54)<the_ru>yes, but I think it puts too much focus on the attributes
(10:44:09)<joe6pack>than make them less significant 
(10:44:17)<the_ru>if I'm ever given a choice what to improve, I always pick the attribute
(10:44:32)<the_ru>instead of thinking in terms of "what should this character get better at?"
(10:44:49)<joe6pack>as i said
(10:45:01)<joe6pack>don't allow players to improve attributes 
(10:45:18)<joe6pack>just to set them during character creation
(10:45:37)<the_ru>I just wonder if they're needed at all
(10:45:47)<the_ru>perhaps they could be replaced by binary intrinsics
(10:45:55)<the_ru>such as "strong", "fast healing", etc
(10:45:59)<joe6pack>i know, but i think this purist point of view is not the one which will maximize fun
(10:46:29)<joe6pack>even though it might be more "elegant" from a design pov
(10:46:42)<joe6pack>hum
(10:46:43)<joe6pack>maybe
(10:51:12)<the_ru>kind of like Fallout traits/perks
(10:51:21)<joe6pack>yeah
(10:52:26)<the_ru>In HASAD (my previous RL attempt) I had "facets"
(10:52:39)<the_ru>there was a number of different rolls
(10:52:54)<the_ru>that were affected by different facets you assigned your character
(10:53:50)<the_ru>for example, the "Strong" facet would affect all rolls that depended on raw strength
(10:59:30)<the_ru>I'm not sure how I would handle certain things though
(10:59:44)<the_ru>What determines the characters carrying capacity?
(11:00:20)<konijn_nyt>I dont believe in stat less games
(11:00:34)<konijn_nyt>if a mouse and a giant have the same skill in carrying
(11:00:49)<konijn_nyt>if skills still means 'how good are you at it'
(11:00:58)<konijn_nyt>then giant should still be able to carry more
(11:01:07)<konijn_nyt>there is skill and there is physical modifiers
(11:01:28)<the_ru>I don't think I need to have any separation, actually
(11:01:36)<Kadwiell>You could pretty easily reduce that one to "size", though
(11:01:38)<the_ru>I can just call them all traits
(11:01:45)<konijn_nyt>how can you train size ??
(11:01:51)<Kadwiell>You can't, that's the point
(11:01:59)<Kadwiell>But an elephant can carry a lot more than a mouse
(11:02:02)<konijn_nyt>so, its an attribute
(11:02:09)<the_ru>the problem is that the "attributes" affect the "skills"
(11:02:17)<konijn_nyt>that is great, not a problem
(11:02:24)<konijn_nyt>tell me how that's a problem
(11:02:49)<Kadwiell>Right, but size won't change at all, so I'd not even call it an attribute (as "attribute" is used in conventional RPG terminology)
(11:03:05)<the_ru>because it places the emphasis on basic attributes instead of skills
(11:03:28)<the_ru>also, many of my current attributes are actually more like skills
(11:03:33)<konijn_nyt>ah, well, that depends on your game environment
(11:03:34)<the_ru>stealth, for example
(11:03:43)<the_ru>should be among the skills, not the attributes
(11:03:45)<konijn_nyt>a mice could be fed a potion of giant growth
(11:03:54)<konijn_nyt>a fighter could drink a potion of strength
(11:04:25)<konijn_nyt>someone could in an sf environment increase gravity, increasing strengh ;)
(11:04:32)<konijn_nyt>or have dna re engineering
(11:04:35)<konijn_nyt>etc.
(11:05:24)<joe6pack>i'm with konijn in this one, in the sense that i don't think it is a problem
(11:05:39)<joe6pack>that attribute effect skills
(11:05:45)<Kadwiell>I don't really think it's a problem either
(11:06:01)<joe6pack>especially since you can minimze that effect if you wish
(11:06:54)<joe6pack>in making increasing the skills with experience more significant than the effects any attribute or set of attributes have on them 
(11:06:57)<Kadwiell>Also, I think that if you go to far with "traits" like "strong", "really strong", "athletic", "really incredibly amazingly strong" and so on, you will effectively be back with a statted system
(11:07:05)<Kadwiell>Just without actual visible numbers for the stats
(11:07:59)<the_ru>Hm
(11:08:51)<the_ru>another problem is that with attributes affecting skills, the rolls quickly grow out of the desired range
(11:08:56)<Kadwiell>If you're worried about players neglecting skills, you could do things like Gearhead does and require people to train a certain number of skills past a certain point before they can train the associated attribute
(11:09:11)<the_ru>most should be between -4 and +4; beyond that is truly superhuman
(11:10:02)<konijn_nyt>that seems very limited to me...
(11:10:14)<konijn_nyt>integers only ?
(11:10:20)<the_ru>yes
(11:10:28)<konijn_nyt>so a demi-god is 4 ?
(11:10:47)<the_ru>no, not really
(11:10:47)<Kadwiell>Seems limited, but the numbers could mean anything, I guess..
(11:11:05)<konijn_nyt>ah, I missed the superhuman part
(11:11:27)<konijn_nyt>still have a range from -4 to +4 does not allow for a lot of character growth
(11:11:31)<konijn_nyt>or subtle growth\
(11:11:35)<the_ru>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudge_%28role-playing_game%29#Game_mechanics
(11:20:10)<the_ru>so, how do Angbands skills work?
(11:20:12)<the_ru>http://linux.softpedia.com/screenshots/Angband_1.png
(11:20:33)<joe6pack>eh
(11:20:38)<joe6pack>kind of like d&d iirc
(11:20:46)<konijn_nyt>skills work in to it
(11:20:46)<joe6pack>oldschool d&d
(11:20:49)<konijn_nyt>but its kind of hidden
(11:20:58)<the_ru>I want my entire character sheet to look like that list
(11:21:17)<the_ru>listing your actual abilities and chances of success
(11:27:15)<joe6pack>ok i officially got the job
(11:27:21)<the_ru>great!
(11:27:24)<the_ru>what is it?
(11:27:24)<joe6pack>tomorrow i'm going to sign the contract
(11:27:32)<joe6pack>as a programmer 
(11:30:46)<the_ru>programming what?
(11:30:58)<joe6pack>data mining 
(11:31:01)<joe6pack>search
(11:31:11)<joe6pack>and all kinds of peripheral systems
(11:32:12)<joe6pack>extracting meaning from raw data
(11:32:23)<the_ru>spambots? :-)
(11:32:34)<joe6pack>no 
(11:32:56)<joe6pack>http://lixto.at/
(11:33:21)<joe6pack>http://www.lixto.com/online_market_intelligence/
(11:33:45)<joe6pack>http://www.lixto.com/metasearch//SGLSESSID/900f59fde06a94373ccbc6ef45c36fb5
(11:35:41)<the_ru>buzzwords galore!
(11:35:52)<joe6pack>yup
(11:38:55)<the_ru>"Lixto's patended technology enables..."
(11:38:59)<the_ru>patended? :-)
(11:40:32)<the_ru>So, my revised trait list: speed, stealth, dodge, mechanics, craft/repair, unarmed, swing, stab, throw, archery
(11:40:43)<the_ru>none of them affect the others
(11:41:11)<joe6pack>"mechanics, craft/repair"?
(11:41:32)<the_ru>no magic skills for now, since I haven't completely decided what the magic system will look like yet
(11:41:43)<the_ru>mechanics are traps and lockpicking
(11:41:53)<joe6pack>"unarmed, swing, stab, throw, archery" -> unarmed, melee, ranged?
(11:42:35)<joe6pack>i don't think people really practice stabbing and swinging separately 
(11:42:44)<joe6pack>they just learn how to use a knife
(11:42:51)<the_ru>craft/repair is repairing armor & weapons, fletchery, alchemy, etc
(11:43:03)<the_ru>I'm not sure about those actually
(11:43:15)<the_ru>I have 9 combat skills now, that's way too many
(11:43:26)<the_ru>But I need more than 1
(11:43:41)<joe6pack>3>1
(11:43:54)<the_ru>it shouldn't just be possible, but necessary, to specialise in one weapon type
(11:44:08)<the_ru>well, weapon skills I mean
(11:44:21)<the_ru>melee weapon skills
(11:44:45)<joe6pack>i'm going to bed now, need to be at the office tommorrow morning to go through the legal stuff 
(11:44:52)<the_ru>yes
(11:44:54)<the_ru>GL HF

(08:37:07)<deveah>woohoo! 5 gb of music samples downloaded! now i can _really_ make awes0me music!
(08:49:09)<TMCSleep>:o
(09:15:52)<deveah>pretty cool samples, but pretty unsorted...
(09:16:22)<deveah>unpacked they have 10,1 GB
(09:16:39)<deveah>13114 samples
(09:24:26)<deveah>i'm so going to participate at this http://rlmusiccontest.googlepages.com/
(09:28:29)<deveah>anyone here participating?
(10:06:23)<syntax_tn>sounds interesting, but i don't make sample-based music anymore
(03:45:11)<the_ru>eh
(03:45:36)<the_ru>I don't think that contest sounds like a good idea
(03:47:31)<deveah>well
(03:47:45)<syntax_tn>i don't like the limitation on medieval/renaissance music. thats like limiting all roguelikes to clich√© fantasy
(03:47:57)<deveah>it gave me .sf2 sound samples, which aren't supported by Milkytracker...
(03:48:20)<deveah>yeah, my favourite genre is science-fiction, and i would win on that theme
(03:49:19)<syntax_tn>i'd rather appreciate an anything goes contest, but that would be harder to rate and compare. but well
(03:56:39)<Grish|Coding>o
(03:56:41)<Grish|Coding>o/
(03:56:42)<Grish|Coding>hellos
(04:03:34)<deveah>hi Grish|coding
(04:03:37)<Kadwiell>Hello
(04:04:15)<Kadwiell>Hm, I have to say I don't really associate roguelikes with any musical genre
(04:05:07)<Grish|Coding>wut?
(04:06:33)<Kadwiell>That was to the conversation before you joined, apparently there's a contest to compose soundtracks for roguelikes
(04:06:41)<Grish|Coding>ahh
(04:06:49)<Grish|Coding>Ohh I should try. :P
(04:08:22)<deveah>i'm leaving the contest, it's severely limited and soundfonts SUCK
(04:08:33)<Grish|Coding>oh really?
(04:08:35)<deveah>hey Fobbah
(04:08:40)<Fobbah>hey
(04:08:43)<deveah>yeah
(04:08:53)<Grish|Coding>So you cant just make your own music?
(04:08:53)<Fobbah>sup?
(04:10:03)<deveah>well I'm a musician too, and I wanted to try that contest, but because the samples are given as soundfonts (which are supported only by professional apps) and now waves(which are supported by anything) I'm leaving the contest :/
(04:10:21)<the_ru>"professional"?
(04:10:29)<the_ru>well, anyway
(04:10:36)<Fobbah>i was planning to attempt an entry in the contest but after reading into it i couldnt be stuffed mucking around with soundfonts
(04:10:57)<Fobbah>i really dont understand why we cant just compose it whatever way we like if we're supposed to be submitting it as an .mp3
(04:11:20)<the_ru>yes
(04:11:26)<the_ru>and why the fantasy restriction?
(04:11:36)<the_ru>and what is the point of the whole contest anyway?
(04:11:41)<Fobbah>well i suppose it was nice to set a theme
(04:11:55)<the_ru>what makes a song a roguelike song? :-)
(04:11:58)<Fobbah>ive never really tried to compose a piece in medieval/plainsong theme
(04:12:24)<Fobbah>i got all sorts of mids from video games from mine, and whatever suits the mood of the level works fine
(04:19:21)<deveah>you can always ask for a musician :)
(04:19:38)<deveah>http://indiegamemusic.com i think
(04:27:18)<deveah>hey starfire
(04:27:46)<StarFire>Hi.
(04:28:14)<StarFire>This the IRC channel of rec.games.roguelike.development?
(04:28:29)<Fobbah>that's right
(04:28:43)<StarFire>I'm a long-time lurker, so I thought I'd check it out. :)
(04:29:47)<Fobbah>i was suprised when i actually found out about this channel myself, i'd looked to see if there were any RL developers hiding on irc for a while but never found a like to this chan
(04:29:58)<Fobbah>*link to this chan even
(04:30:07)<StarFire>I was just browsing google groups and found out about this.
(04:30:17)<Fobbah>yeah i think thats how i found it
(04:32:16)<Fobbah>en i actually found out about this channel myself, i'd looked to see if there were any RL developers hiding on irc for a while but never found a like to this chan
(04:32:16)<Fobbah>[00:36] <Fobbah> *link to this chan even
(04:32:16)<Fobbah>[00:36] <StarFire> I was just browsing google groups and foun
(04:32:21)<Fobbah>oops
(04:32:34)<Fobbah>mirc acting funny when trying to ctrl-V
(04:33:32)<Fobbah>was trying to say, finally got around to throwing up a quick page for escape from fobbahland: http://fobbah.googlepages.com/escapefromfobbahland
(04:33:58)<Glowie>Not Escape from Fobbahisland? :P
(04:35:11)<Fobbah>hmm. now there's a plot idea, escape from fobbah island. i was really more thinking about running away from my office screaming from boredom when i dreamt up the name.
(04:35:45)<Glowie>The "Escape from" just reminded me of Escape from Monkey Island
(04:35:53)<Fobbah>indeed.
(04:36:03)<StarFire>I'm off for some studying now, talk with you guys later!
(04:36:11)<Glowie>I see clear DoomRL influences in the screenshots :P
(04:36:15)<Glowie>See you StarFire
(04:36:21)<Fobbah>yep definitely
(04:36:46)<Fobbah>you might get that feeling from the in-game midi music as well
(04:36:49)<Fobbah>and the shooting :P
(04:37:01)<Glowie>Is it a shooter roguelike too?
(04:37:16)<Fobbah>for now, but i intend to put in melee/spellcasting classes too
(04:37:26)<Fobbah>next release will have the basics of a class system
(04:38:16)<Fobbah>i was thinking i'll use something like the technique system from nethack/slashem to make melee interesting
(04:38:53)<Fobbah>dunno if i'm going to go with that system for spellcasting or some sort of mana system though *shrugs*
(04:39:04)<Glowie>Okie
(04:39:17)<Glowie>Vanilla Nethack doesn't have techniques
(04:41:08)<Fobbah>well yeah but you know what i'm talking about
(04:41:32)<Kadwiell>What are they like? I haven't played much slashem
(04:41:40)<Glowie>Actually me neither
(04:41:42)<Glowie>I know what Slashem is
(04:41:44)<Fobbah>i really like the monk techniques in slashem mostly
(04:41:47)<Glowie>But I don't like its changes
(04:41:56)<Fobbah>the rest of slashem i'm not too keen on
(04:42:03)<Glowie>What are the monk techs like?
(04:42:14)<Grish|Coding>Hi Glowie
(04:42:19)<Glowie>Might inspire more melee skills to my roguelike too
(04:42:20)<Glowie>Heya Grish
(04:42:24)<Kadwiell>There's a fine line between making melee interesting and making it take up a lot of time..
(04:42:33)<Kadwiell>But if it's fun it doesn't matter if it does, of course
(04:42:44)<Fobbah>powerful strikes, quick dashes over several squares, elemental damage on your strikes for a few turns, combos of techniques in a single turn
(04:42:58)<Glowie>Okie, pretty much the same stuff
(04:43:14)<Kadwiell>You select them like spells/skills, or they appear at random?
(04:43:28)<Fobbah>you gain them at certain levels
(04:43:43)<Glowie>Kadwiell: I added a quick button that you can point to a skill and then just smash it while fighting so that you don't have to go to menus and slow the game down
(04:43:57)<Kadwiell>Ah, that's nice
(04:44:03)<Kadwiell>Worked well for Diablo
(04:44:24)<Fobbah>basically the way it works is that theres no mana cost to using them, but after using a technique you cant use it again for a few hundred turns
(04:44:49)<Glowie>Okay
(04:44:58)<Fobbah>i think what makes it interesting is it forces you to use all of your abilities, rather than just whatever spell is most powerful/mana efficient at the time over and over
(04:44:58)<Glowie>I just went the mana/special point way
(04:45:05)<Glowie>Ah
(04:45:09)<Glowie>Indeed that's a good thing
(04:45:38)<Fobbah>so the combat is actually quite exciting because you've got to weigh out when to use your heavy hitting skills, and juggle other skills together etc
(04:47:29)<Glowie>Sounds good
(04:54:50)<deveah>anyone wanna play scorched earth?
(04:55:15)<Fobbah>lol where at?
(04:55:45)<deveah>http://scorch2000.com
(04:58:17)<Fobbah>how do i join your game then?
(04:58:43)<deveah>well, I'll start a game
(04:59:28)<deveah>join "somegame"
(04:59:53)<deveah>(game passwd)
(05:00:13)<deveah>anyone else?
(05:00:30)<deveah>Glowie, TMC, wanna play?
(05:00:46)<Kadwiell>I'll join for a round
(05:00:51)<deveah>come on
(05:01:00)<deveah>quick, before the timeout!
(05:01:59)<Kadwiell>Huh, it redirected me to the "Create new game" dialog
(05:02:04)<deveah>20 seconds!
(05:02:08)<deveah>join "somegame"
(05:02:10)<deveah>wuick!!!!
(05:02:12)<deveah>quick
(05:02:16)<deveah>10 seconds
(05:02:28)<deveah>too late
(05:02:28)<Fobbah>its stupid, the way you select a game is by putting the game name in "game password" on the front screen.
(05:04:43)<Kadwiell>Hm, okay.. didn't seem to work for me the first time
(05:05:16)<Fobbah>rofl where the hell am i against this red background
(05:05:22)<Fobbah>oh wait its you :P
(05:05:22)<Kadwiell>Perhaps I'll join if you guys play another round
(05:05:41)<deveah>you can talk in the game, you know
(05:05:57)<deveah>just press any key that's not in the dpad and you're talking
(05:08:40)<Glowie>Scorched earth looks crude
(05:08:45)<Glowie>I've seen smoother clones
(05:15:40)<Fobbah>heheheh funky nuke.
(05:15:44)<deveah>now - who's playing?
(05:15:58)<Fobbah>i'm done for now, ive got serious work to do :(
(05:16:11)<deveah>me too - i'm leaving
(05:32:14)<jraregris>asfsjk
(06:03:47)<the_ru>Hm
(06:04:42)<the_ru>I wonder if I should remove my "Unarmed" skill and instead have a list of moves
(06:05:23)<the_ru>so instead of just increasing your skill and getting +1 to-hit, +1 damage, you learn new techniques you use
(06:05:36)<the_ru>counter-attacks, throws, etc
(06:06:02)<deveah>blackboard grafitti http://www.imagehost.ro/pict/11191101484ff91596550.jpg
(06:06:15)<deveah>markerboard actually
(06:07:14)<deveah>http://www.imagehost.ro/pict/11191240484ff97878fb4.jpg
(06:07:58)<deveah>http://www.imagehost.ro/pict/11191318484ff99e29c54.jpg
(06:09:51)<the_ru>that's your classroom?
(06:25:15)<deveah>yes
(06:42:02)<deveah>that's me next to my Oxide
(07:07:05)<the_ru>Eh
(07:07:16)<the_ru>I'm implementing polymorph traps
(07:07:30)<the_ru>"You transform into a war boar! It's dark..."
(07:29:47)<Fobbah>you got a webpage or something up for your RL the_ru?
(07:42:36)<the_ru>I do
(07:42:38)<the_ru>http://www.eagle.y.se/~ru/roguelike.php
(08:18:00)<the_ru>so, they seem to work
(08:18:10)<the_ru>the "It's dark..." message was a bit odd
(08:18:31)<the_ru>it's because I replaced the player creature, but the calling function still pointed to the old one...
(09:03:34)<jomiolto>np. Skaven - War in the Middle Earth
(09:03:40)<jomiolto>perfect roguelike music <3
(09:04:25)<jomiolto>http://www.futurecrew.com/skaven/song_files/war.s3m
(09:05:06)<Glowie>Porcupine Tree - Anesthetize
(09:05:09)<Glowie>I prefer progressive
(09:06:29)<jomiolto>I usually listen to ambient when I'm doing something or pretty much anything when I'm actually listening to music
(09:06:55)<jomiolto>but sometimes trance is good for coding :)
(09:07:08)<Glowie>Real ambient is too quiet for listening :<
(09:07:16)<Glowie>I despise trance, it's too repetitive
(09:07:46)<jomiolto>well, that's kind of true for most trance
(09:07:56)<jomiolto>but there are some artists I like
(09:08:01)<Fobbah>depends on what you're calling trance
(09:08:08)<joe6pack>utz utz utz 
(09:08:37)<Glowie>Utz utz utz = trance
(09:08:50)<joe6pack>yes
(09:08:57)<joe6pack>they love this shit here
(09:08:57)<Fobbah>just because a song has a strong beat doesnt mean its nessecarily going to be repetitive.. in fact i'd say most trance ISNT repetitive
(09:09:15)<Fobbah>other types of electronic music can be though eg techno
(09:09:16)<joe6pack>you can turn on the radio in 9 in the morning and hear it
(09:09:22)<Glowie>A strong, short beat that is copy pasted throughout the whole song IS repetitiev
(09:09:23)<Glowie>ve*
(09:09:31)<jomiolto>not all trance is like that
(09:09:35)<Fobbah>yeah, but that's not what trance sounds like dude
(09:09:46)<Glowie>Not all trance perhaps :<
(09:09:51)<Fobbah>no, not most trance
(09:10:04)<Fobbah>you're seriously not thinking about trance, you're just thinking of electronic music in general
(09:10:14)<jomiolto>I used to have some brilliant, *really* fast paced trance I loved to listen while coding, but I've lost the files and I can't remember the artist name :'(
(09:10:47)<Glowie>So in your words, electronic music = repetitive. And trance is part of the electronic genre, is it not? :P
(09:11:08)<Fobbah>*sigh*
(09:11:14)<Glowie>That's what it sounded like
(09:11:18)<Glowie>But I know you didn't mean that.
(09:11:27)<Fobbah>no, techno and most electronic music is repetitive. trance is not like techno.
(09:11:34)<Glowie>Hmm
(09:11:35)<purestrain>metal ftw
(09:11:46)<Glowie>Actually I never learned the difference between trance and techno. Care to explain?
(09:11:58)<Glowie>Metal gets old very quickly, like in 2 years
(09:12:03)<Glowie>I moved from metal to progressive music
(09:12:06)<Fobbah>techno is basically more repetitive and has a stronger beat and less melody
(09:12:18)<purestrain>metal never gets old
(09:12:20)<purestrain>metal ftw
(09:12:23)<Fobbah>trance may have a strong bass kick, but it tends to be very melodic
(09:12:24)<purestrain>viking metal ftw
(09:12:32)<purestrain>epic melodic death metal ftw
(09:12:56)<Glowie>Okay Fobbah
(09:13:04)<purestrain>metal ftw
(09:13:06)<Glowie>Metal is a very.. Restricted genre
(09:13:15)<Glowie>Not much room for variation
(09:13:20)<Fobbah>i used to be big into metal, but i'll agree with glowie on that one
(09:13:29)<purestrain>very much room for variation
(09:13:43)<purestrain>speed metal, viking metal, death metal, epic metal
(09:13:44)<Fobbah>you listen to enough metal bands for enough years and it starts to all sound the same
(09:14:01)<Fobbah>the same palm muted riffs, the same beats *yawn*
(09:14:03)<purestrain>maybe you should try different subgenres ?
(09:14:14)<Fobbah>lol i've listened to a LOT of metal in my day :)
(09:14:16)<Glowie>Heard most of them
(09:14:18)<Glowie>Me too
(09:14:31)<Fobbah>if you put it end to end you could probably listen to my metal collection for about 3-4 weeks
(09:14:37)<Fobbah>but i'm tired of it nowadays
(09:14:40)<Glowie>I listened to most except black, couldn't stand the shrieks
(09:14:42)<jomiolto>progressive metal? doom metal? symphonic metal?
(09:14:45)<purestrain>how.. you must be a rich boy
(09:14:52)<Glowie>Progressive metal is still good for me
(09:14:59)<Fobbah>torrents and only buying worthy albums
(09:15:04)<jomiolto>I think there's plenty of variation in metal
(09:15:38)<purestrain>so i'm beginning to dislike you
(09:15:40)<Fobbah>i dont subscribe to the idea of trying to discover new bands by buying albums en-masse before being able to listen to a single track
(09:16:08)<purestrain>most bands put some demo track on their homepages
(09:16:24)<purestrain>or you are able to listen to them via amazon
(09:16:33)<purestrain>thats no reason for illegal downloads
(09:16:56)<Fobbah>i've bought plenty of albums simply because i liked what albums i've downloaded
(09:17:07)<Fobbah>in fact, i'd wager i've spent about 3-4 times as much as i would have otherwise
(09:17:16)<jomiolto>purestrain: what about artists that don't mind copying? what if it's only the record company that doesn't like it?
(09:17:28)<purestrain>but you've listened to much more than actually buying, do you?
(09:17:50)<Fobbah>frankly if the artists arent happy with the way i do business with them, i couldnt give a flying fuck. i still put money into plenty of people's pockets and that's just the reality of the industry
(09:18:33)<Fobbah>the artists/labels that wake up to that fact will go far in the next few decades
(09:18:36)<purestrain>yeah, next step is software piracy, right ?
(09:18:48)<Fobbah>nah, i take a different stance on software piracy
(09:19:18)<purestrain>so you don't think that either the label / musicians don't want to get paid for their work ?
(09:19:47)<Fobbah>i do pay them for their work in the order of $100s of dollars each year in albums, concert tickets and merchandise
(09:20:16)<purestrain>actually you have a lot more music on harddisk than paid for, right ?
(09:20:27)<Fobbah>yes but they didnt lose a cent from me having it
(09:21:04)<Fobbah>its a simple fact that i spend more money now than i would if i didnt download music
(09:21:05)<purestrain>maybe you would not buy the albums, but you listen to what they worked (more or less) hard for
(09:21:40)<purestrain>perhaps you do even share the music to friends? who themselve share the music and so on?
(09:22:42)<Fobbah>i can see your point. what you're not grasping is the fact that i feel that i spend more money now after investigating artists through P2P sources than i would otherwise, and that by being a BETTER CONSUMER i dont feel that i've wronged them.
(09:23:15)<purestrain>if you are stealing something expensive, would you argue with 'oh, they actually don't lose a cent from me since i would never buy it...'
(09:23:33)<purestrain>'before nobody buys it, i'm stealing it...'
(09:23:55)<Fobbah>*sigh* you just dont get it do you. that whole argument doesnt wash with me.
(09:24:15)<jomiolto>copyright infringement and stealing are two different things
(09:24:29)<purestrain>right, they are
(09:24:38)<purestrain>but both are illegal
(09:24:58)<jomiolto>and I quite agree with Fobbah; I would have completely stopped buying music years ago, if it wasn't for torrents
(09:25:06)<Fobbah>who gives a shit what's illegal, i do what i feel is best for me, my fellow citizens, and even the artists themselves
(09:25:16)<purestrain>and i would really care if someone uses my software, which i've hard worked for, with the argument 'i wouldn't buy it either'
(09:25:34)<Fobbah>if you take that much stock in what the government thinks is right for you without thinking for yourself i really feel sorry for whatever country educated you
(09:25:40)<jomiolto>laws do not define morality
(09:25:53)<purestrain>...
(09:26:03)<Fobbah>not that i'm taking a serious attack at you, but jomilolto put it perfectly
(09:26:18)<purestrain>fobbah, so delete everything which you haven't bought yet, if its not worth paying for
(09:26:18)<Fobbah>just because something is illegal doesnt mean its wrong, or that the law works
(09:27:24)<purestrain>do you ?
(09:27:39)<Fobbah>some of it
(09:28:03)<purestrain>and the rest? listen to it until it gets boring and tell me 'i wouldn't bought it anyway' ?
(09:28:10)<Fobbah>some i wouldnt delete even if i really like the artist
(09:28:39)<jomiolto>I actually have only one CD of illegally downloaded music (all other's I've bought or deleted), and that only because you can't really get that CD from anywhere (and the artist himself has told people to just copy it anyway)
(09:28:55)<Fobbah>hell one of my favourite bands is local, and ive not purchased any of their albums
(09:29:30)<Fobbah>i have, however, been to about a dozen of their shows, and bought a ton of their merchandise. merchandise especially, the money goes more directly into their pocket
(09:29:38)<Fobbah>mature artists understand this
(09:29:51)<Fobbah>record companies dont
(09:30:26)<purestrain>don't you know why? record companies own the rights for publication... they pay for covers, they actually put the music on cds
(09:30:47)<purestrain>they do lot of advertisment
(09:31:17)<Fobbah>if you looked through my library you wouldnt find a lot of music sponsored by major labels
(09:31:55)<purestrain>i actually don't want to see it
(09:32:10)<Fobbah>lol i sicken you that much eh
(09:32:18)<Fobbah>the music industry is changing mate
(09:32:55)<purestrain>i barely could understand if you listen to the music, don't like it and delete it
(09:33:05)<Fobbah>the simple fact remains that i probably spend ten times as much as the next guy on cds, merc and tickets than the next guy.
(09:33:15)<Fobbah>lol repeating myself
(09:33:16)<Fobbah>but yeah
(09:33:23)<purestrain>but not if you keep it on harddisc and tell 'hey, i've 3-4 weeks of music'
(09:34:42)<Fobbah>how much do you honestly spend on cds, tickets, etc a year
(09:35:57)<purestrain>i don't count it; i'm mostly visiting medieval markets and buy cds directly there, so no real tickets
(09:36:47)<purestrain>perhaps 5-6 cd's year bought on online shops
(09:36:48)<Fobbah>i would have spent about 5-600 on concert tickets alone this year
(09:37:01)<Fobbah>(AUD that is)
(09:37:32)<Fobbah>another couple hundred on cover charges in pubs and merch sold in small gigs
(09:37:57)<purestrain>so i would be fine spending money for concerts on a specific group and start downloading their whole albums ?
(09:38:25)<purestrain>thats great, almost revolutionary
(09:38:28)<Fobbah>for example, i downloaded a ton of armin van buuren's radio shows without paying for that service recently. became a fan, and instead of paying $20 a year, i spent $120ish on a ticket to go see him DJ
(09:38:55)<joe6pack>you buy your cds in medieval markets?
(09:39:04)<joe6pack>are those cow hive cds?
(09:39:25)<purestrain>fobbah, did you speak with him and his label about your idea ?
(09:40:34)<Fobbah>nope, but you're not going to find many artists what have a problem with that whose words havnt been bought by some retarded suit in a record company
(09:40:48)<Fobbah>they're not even fooling themselves when they try to convince us lost sales are due to piracy
(09:41:09)<Fobbah>what's REALLY going on is that these execs have to account for any dip in sales from year to year
(09:41:37)<Fobbah>and when it doesnt go too well for them, they point the finger and blame the internet, because their ass is on the line from the shareholders.
(09:42:08)<purestrain>i'm not talking about loss in sales, and so on, i will just say that you own something which you actually haven't paid for
(09:42:28)<Fobbah>i can acknowledge that. do i feel bad about it? no.
(09:44:21)<Fobbah>if you cant see that with a product with a high fixed cost, zero variable cost, losing stock to "thieves" but a corellating increase in sales is a good thing, you dont belong in business.
(09:44:55)<Fobbah>lol spite.
(09:45:45)<joe6pack>i need juicier quotes to take out of context 
(09:45:49)<joe6pack>get to work guys 
(09:45:54)<purestrain>maybe every artist/band/whatever should just place their songs on a p2p-network and hope someone is paying for it
(09:46:28)<Fobbah>its like telling someone hes a jerk for nicking a dollar out of his wallet to use in a vending machine and leaving a fiver in there in exchange
(09:46:34)<Fobbah>it just doesnt add up.
(09:47:08)<purestrain>hmmhmm... i don't understand that sentence :-(
(09:47:21)<Fobbah>i'm putting back in more than i take away from them
(09:48:04)<Fobbah>if me and a bunch of my friends go see a small band and we really like what we hear on the night, we'd all buy their album/merch
(09:48:12)<joe6pack>purestrain: hed->is, nicking->stealing
(09:48:19)<joe6pack>*hes
(09:48:40)<Fobbah>we could just buy one copy and duplicate it
(09:48:42)<Fobbah>but we wouldnt
(09:48:50)<Fobbah>we draw the line at a certain point
(09:49:05)<joe6pack>oh wait that still doesn't make much sense
(09:49:11)<Fobbah>not everyone will have that self control when they think to themselves "oh but i could spend no dollars!!!!111one"
(09:49:14)<joe6pack>although i got your point
(09:50:01)<Fobbah>so i'm not going to attempt to justify it on a whole, although i stand by my fact about executives trying to look like they're not failing at their jobs to shareholders
(09:50:12)<Fobbah>by on a whole i mean everyone who copies music
(09:51:09)<Fobbah>but yeah, i spend plenty of money on cds etc.
(09:51:30)<Fobbah>my basic rule is i download music at will, but if i like what an artist has done and a new album by them comes out, i buy it
(09:51:36)<Fobbah>and i stick to that.
(09:52:03)<Fobbah>some people are going to get hard done by if they dont ever make a new album because they've retired or whatever
(09:52:12)<Fobbah>but the world isnt perfect.
(09:52:18)<purestrain>it makes no sence to me; just delete everything you don't own - if you can't, you have a reason to buy it... whoever gains profit, either the label, the artist or someone else
(09:55:07)<Fobbah>more money spent on cds = less money spent on concerts and merch
(09:55:20)<Fobbah>they wouldnt wind up on top, and cds are overpriced anyway.
(09:56:07)<purestrain>less money spent on concerts = more money spent on cds, but finally legal
(09:56:27)<Fobbah>purestrain, we're getting onto the second point, which is i honestly dont give a shit about the law
(09:57:00)<purestrain>maybe nobody should stick to laws
(09:57:14)<Fobbah>in my experience, beyond the basic defense of ones human rights, law is damaging to society
(09:58:02)<Fobbah>next you're going to try and tell me that the international war on drugs actually works
(09:58:30)<Fobbah>i know so many people whos lives have been destroyed because of small minded people that think just like you.
(09:58:58)<joe6pack>at least the War On The Environment is going well
(09:59:00)<purestrain>ah, now its getting interesting... i'm a small minded man, just because i pay for what i own ?
(09:59:22)<Fobbah>no, because you cant see the big picture
(09:59:30)<purestrain>i can see the big picture
(09:59:33)<Fobbah>but i'll definitely agree with you on the environment point :)
(10:00:07)<purestrain>i can see the big picture
(10:00:16)<purestrain>and i can see the immidiate picture
(10:00:45)<purestrain>if you would own a label, you don't mind if someone is listening music of a band which subscribed to your label?
(10:01:24)<Fobbah>not at all. simple fact is the label is making more money as a result. its simply how it works
(10:01:51)<Fobbah>what most people are not understanding is the motive behind labels attacking piracy has nothing to do with actual damage done by piracy
(10:02:30)<Fobbah>its about CEOs clinging to their jobs after a fall in the marketplace due to the failure of their cash cow pop music products to perform
(10:02:39)<purestrain>are we discussing about motives of labels/piracy ?
(10:03:11)<Fobbah>they have to explain why there's less sales, so they point the finger at a negative market force that cant be quantified
(10:03:38)<purestrain>you are hiding behind something else
(10:04:15)<Fobbah>say again?
(10:04:50)<purestrain>brb, child is crying
(10:05:13)<joe6pack>The War On Children 
(10:06:20)<joe6pack>Inder statt Kinder
(10:07:33)<purestrain>well, got to have to end the discussion now
(10:07:45)<purestrain>Fobbah, sorry, maybe i don't find the proper words
(10:08:20)<Fobbah>lol well dont take anything i said too seriously as any kind of personal attack, i was just getting involved in the discussion
(10:08:34)<Fobbah>laters
(10:10:12)<purestrain>interesting discussion anyway, didn't take it as serious either
(10:10:18)<purestrain>so n8
(10:11:54)<joe6pack>scorch2000?
(10:12:06)<Fobbah>yeah?
(10:12:38)<joe6pack>great
(10:12:44)<joe6pack>who's joining us?
(10:13:22)<Kadwiell>I'll try again :)
(10:13:41)<joe6pack>\o/
(10:14:07)<joe6pack>password: 1234
(10:14:46)<joe6pack>come on guys
(10:15:08)<joe6pack>Kadwiell?
(10:15:21)<Kadwiell>I still don't get it to work :/
(10:15:26)<joe6pack>:(
(10:15:31)<Kadwiell>It just brings me to the "Create new game" screen after I click login
(10:15:36)<Glowie>Does it work in the online Java thingie?
(10:15:41)<joe6pack>try again now
(10:16:00)<Kadwiell>Is there a non-online version?
(10:16:03)<Glowie>And with guest
(10:16:07)<Glowie>I don't know
(10:16:08)<joe6pack>was probably before i started it
(10:16:22)<joe6pack>alright
(10:16:23)<joe6pack>go?
(10:16:31)<joe6pack>or anyone else wants to join?
(10:16:36)<joe6pack>5

(10:16:45)<Glowie>Did Kadwiell get in?
(10:16:48)<joe6pack>yes
(10:16:52)<joe6pack>should we restart?
(10:16:59)<Glowie>I could try playing :P
(10:17:02)<joe6pack>ok
(10:17:11)<Glowie>If it works with guest name
(10:17:24)<joe6pack>i'm setting up a new one
(10:17:28)<Glowie>Okay
(10:17:34)<Kadwiell>I think the reason it didn't work for me was that I didn't use the highest resolution one
(10:17:49)<joe6pack>ok try now
(10:17:54)<joe6pack>password: 1234
(10:17:58)<joe6pack>highest resolution
(10:18:12)<Glowie>Got in

(10:44:09)<joe6pack>bug?
(10:44:50)<Glowie>Fobbah you hear me?
(10:44:57)<Glowie>Ah
(10:44:57)<Glowie>.
(10:45:05)<Fobbah>?
(10:45:08)<Grish|Coding>Oh
(10:45:15)<Grish|Coding>ignore the snag spam from me
(10:45:20)<Grish|Coding>i do /amsg and its for a diff game
(10:45:22)<Grish|Coding>:P
(10:46:27)<joe6pack>damn bugs
(10:47:03)<joe6pack>ok
(10:47:19)<joe6pack>Fobbah?
(10:47:48)<joe6pack>should i start without you?
(10:48:11)<joe6pack>9

(10:55:21)<joe6pack>lame
(10:55:23)<joe6pack>buggy
(10:55:32)<Kadwiell>Yeah
(10:55:32)<Glowie>At least on one Finnish website full o' online java games
(10:55:34)<joe6pack>wasn't that buggy before today
(10:55:45)<Glowie>Must be my presence
(10:55:46)<joe6pack>give us the link then
(10:55:51)<Glowie>Wait a sec
(10:56:15)<Kadwiell>The game is in Finnish too? Ah well, can't be too hard to understand Scorched Earth
(10:56:37)<Fobbah>i should probably go to bed. its 9am
(10:56:48)<Glowie>Haha
(10:57:02)<Glowie>Yesh it works
(10:57:03)<Glowie>http://www.aapeli.com/games/play/tykkipeli
(10:57:05)<Glowie>If you want to play
(10:57:07)<Fobbah>i got caught up debating the finer points of internet piracy for the last few hours.
(10:57:09)<Glowie>I can guide you through the menus
(10:57:13)<Glowie>^__^
(10:57:25)<joe6pack>i'm in
(10:57:47)<Glowie>Pick the right option when it has a split screen with two buttons
(10:57:51)<Glowie>Then you should find yourself in a chat
(10:57:57)<joe6pack>couldn't you find some germanic or romance language...
(10:58:13)<Glowie>I don't know of any
(10:58:16)<joe6pack>ok
(10:58:18)<Glowie>If you know, do let me know
(10:58:25)<joe6pack>what now
(10:58:29)<Glowie>Your name is vieras-###
(10:58:34)<Glowie>(guest-### in Finnish)
(10:58:38)<Glowie>I'll create a game and you join it
(10:58:40)<joe6pack>2154
(10:58:42)<Kadwiell>Hmm.. is there an online mode in atanks?
(10:58:44)<Glowie>"Liity peliin" = join game
(10:58:47)<Glowie>Don't know
(10:59:03)<Glowie>Uhm
(10:59:10)<joe6pack>i'm im
(10:59:14)<joe6pack>*in
(10:59:20)<Glowie>Uhm
(10:59:23)<Glowie>Did everyone get in
(10:59:28)<joe6pack>only us 2
(10:59:39)<Glowie>It didn't ask for a password or a game name >_<
(10:59:45)<Kadwiell>yeah, I think I joined something else
(11:00:00)<Glowie>Damn
(11:00:02)<joe6pack>i quit then
(11:00:06)<Glowie>It has changed a bit since I was last here
(11:00:17)<Glowie>AH!
(11:00:23)<Glowie>Found where you can put a password too
(11:00:25)<Glowie>A second.
(11:00:49)<joe6pack>let's find something in English 
(11:00:49)<Glowie>123 is the password, creating now
(11:00:58)<Glowie>Well if you can find in short amount of time
(11:01:20)<joe6pack>we can play scorch 3d
(11:01:27)<joe6pack>but you need to install it
(11:01:33)<joe6pack>it is free software though
(11:01:47)<Glowie>Hmm
(11:01:52)<Glowie>Not today for me I think
(11:01:59)<Glowie>I can't be that long here anymore
(11:02:01)<Glowie>Just a game or two
(11:02:36)<Glowie>Either one of you is in
(11:02:47)<Kadwiell>That's me :)
(11:02:50)<Fobbah>this shit is random
(11:02:50)<Fobbah>http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/277532
(11:03:16)<Glowie>We could try a game or two if ido jumps in?
(11:03:31)<joe6pack>i'll pass thanks
(11:03:35)<Glowie>Okay
(11:03:53)<Glowie>Kadwiell wanna try 1vs1 or just quit?
(11:04:00)<Kadwiell>We can try a round
(11:04:09)<Glowie>Press the blue button near the names
(11:13:15)<joe6pack>amazing how much the original game is still better than all the rest
(11:13:19)<joe6pack>even though it wa
(11:13:34)<joe6pack>s programed by 1 guy in the early 90's
(11:14:40)<Glowie>In my opinion the version we're playing is better than it
(11:15:02)<joe6pack>i don't like the fact that it's in finnish...
(11:15:11)<joe6pack>computer games should be in english
(11:15:36)<the_ru>LOL @ the whole piracy discussion
(11:15:56)<Glowie>Yeah, it's targeted at a Finnish audience, but at least you don't die in 1 hit
(11:15:57)<joe6pack>arr matey
(11:18:17)<the_ru>I'm a musician that's for free sharing
(11:18:29)<the_ru>but I'm not allowed to have that opinion since I'm not a "real" musician
(11:18:35)<the_ru>i.e. not signed to a label
(11:18:43)<the_ru>since "no one would buy it anyway"
(11:19:21)<the_ru>people fail to see that I'm without a record deal by choice, not because I couldn't find one
(11:23:01)<Glowie>Sorry for raping you like that Kadwiell :<
(11:23:11)<Kadwiell>Hah
(11:23:23)<Kadwiell>I'm sure the game is biased towards Finnish gamers somehow
(11:23:28)<Glowie>:P
(11:24:03)<Grish|Coding>:)
(11:24:03)<Glowie>Hmm
(11:24:08)<Glowie>I think I'll code continue reading Thud! now
(11:24:12)<Glowie>code >_<
(11:24:13)<Glowie>go*
(11:24:27)<Glowie>Don't type and read at the same time (Grish's nick)
(11:24:35)<Grish|Coding>:D
(11:24:42)<Grish|Coding>My bad.
(11:24:43)<Grish|Coding>keke
(11:24:50)<Glowie>Kek ^_^~~
(11:25:14)<Glowie>G'night people
+++ The date has changed: 2008/06/12 +++
(01:47:57)<dana_>Hi rgrd
(03:42:06)<dana_>Is it always so quiet because most people in the community are in Europe?
(03:50:03)<jraregris>quite possible
(03:56:08)<dana_>Heh
(03:56:56)<dana_>When is usually primetime?
(04:02:51)<jraregris>I'm not sure
(04:03:24)<jraregris>It can be quiet for long, and suddenly burst in to discussion
(04:05:05)<dana_>Ah cool
(04:09:33)<TMC>its 2pm
(04:09:35)<TMC>bedtime!
(04:10:38)<TMCSleep>oh, I just had an exam on PDEs
(04:11:00)<TMCSleep>(for anyone who does maths) I must mention a halirious error I made in the exam
(04:11:05)<jraregris>PDEs?
(04:11:17)<TMCSleep>partial differential equations
(04:11:27)<TMCSleep>I took cos(x) = Re(exp(x))
(04:11:41)<TMCSleep>to do a Fourier tranform of cos(x)
(04:11:45)<jraregris>aha...so not (eclipse) plugin development enviroment, then...
(04:12:28)<jraregris>what's 'Re'?
(04:15:24)<dana_>Ahh!  Scary math is scary
(10:36:10)<deveah>morning
(10:41:05)<StarFire>Good morning.
(10:42:54)<deveah>it's morning to you too? :o
(10:43:11)<StarFire>Well, no, 11:49 here.
(10:45:04)<deveah>11:49 here too
(10:45:10)<deveah>well 11:51 now
(10:50:03)<deveah>where's "here" to you?
(10:50:15)<deveah>Finland?
(10:51:12)<StarFire>Yup.
(04:56:50)<Grish|Coding>hi guys
(04:56:51)<Grish|Coding>:)
(05:02:40)<Kadwiell>Hello
(05:05:53)<Grish|Coding>Whats up?
(05:10:15)<Kadwiell>Nothing much, trying to figure out how OpenGL works
(05:10:39)<Grish|Coding>Ahh
(05:10:41)<Grish|Coding>Eeek
(05:11:02)<Grish|Coding>I have a few bookmarks for beginning open gl programming in c++ if you would like them
(05:13:54)<Kadwiell>Any you found especially helpful? Otherwise I'm already at the googling random stuff stage :)
(05:14:25)<Grish|Coding>Well, my buddy gave me this link, and he said it was quite helpfull
(05:14:32)<Fobbah>arent the nehe tutorials supposed to be good?
(05:15:09)<Grish|Coding>hmm, I have to actually look for it, I dont think I BMed 
(05:15:09)<Grish|Coding>shiz
(05:15:20)<Grish|Coding>there it is
(05:15:21)<Grish|Coding>yeah
(05:15:23)<Grish|Coding>its the nehe
(05:15:31)<Grish|Coding>http://nehe.gamedev.net/lesson.asp?index=01
(05:15:32)<Kadwiell>Yeah, I've looked at those, they are nice
(05:16:08)<Grish|Coding>I had a few other, but I think I accidentlly deleted them.
(05:16:20)<Grish|Coding>One was really nice that came with source code and stuff
(05:17:09)<Grish|Coding>I found it a long time ago, but I couldnt find it again.
(05:52:26)<Glowie>I've heard that NeHe is awfully outdated and written by a newbie :b
(05:52:51)<Glowie>I'd suggest you get a cheap book if you're more serious about OpenGL. I enjoyed the one written by a few GameDev.net admins
(05:53:18)<Glowie>It's so big it's not very easy to learn with just online tutorials, especially when you aren't sure if they're teaching good habits or not
(05:56:13)<Kadwiell>But I'm not really serious, just playing around.. NeHe is probably appropriate :)
(05:59:39)<Glowie>Okie
(06:02:45)<TMCSleep>nooooo
(06:02:53)<TMCSleep>what have I gotten myself into?
(06:03:28)<TMCSleep>suggesting that I might be able to pixelate, suddenly I am getting tile pixelating duties thrust upon me
(06:03:50)<TMCSleep>when I have no idea whether I'm capable of it at all
(06:04:51)<TMCSleep>to me, the nehe tutorial doesn't look that great
(06:05:14)<TMCSleep>it just skips over everything and tells you how to do a few very specific things
(06:06:20)<TMCSleep>I read through a few of them, and decided that by about number 5 or something, it was no longer helpful
(06:07:14)<TMCSleep>anyway, bedtime
(06:11:41)<jomiolto>heh, 2048 lines of code in my current roguelike and 8192 in my roguelike library :)
(06:11:48)<jomiolto>what a coincidence
(06:12:40)<TMCSleep>:O
(06:12:49)<TMCSleep>you set that up, admit it
(06:12:57)<jomiolto>no I didn't
(06:13:01)<TMCSleep>did too
(06:13:03)<jomiolto>that's why it's weird/funny
(06:13:15)<TMCSleep>that's not weird
(06:13:22)<TMCSleep>it's unbelievable
(06:14:05)<TMCSleep>(in both senses)
(06:14:14)<jomiolto>just very unlikely
(06:14:52)<jomiolto>although, in a few moments the numbers will be different when I write new code/change old stuff
(06:15:05)<TMCSleep>hmm
(06:15:14)<jomiolto>perhaps I should make a backup of this moment, so I can look back to it a 20 years from now :)
(06:15:19)<TMCSleep>depends how often you check the linecounts
(06:15:21)<TMCSleep>yes :)
(06:15:53)<jomiolto>I usually check them after making some major changes to see what the current trend of the code base is
(06:16:52)<jomiolto>rapidly growing code base is usually a sign of major problems, unless you're adding a heap of features
(06:17:16)<TMCSleep>hmm, that's an interesting idea
(06:17:32)<jomiolto>it's just something I've personally noticed in my own projects
(06:18:02)<TMCSleep>adding too much useless infrastructure?
(06:18:04)<jomiolto>often when I get "disillusioned" and lose the direction I'm going with the project, I somehow end up adding all kinds of useless code
(06:18:18)<TMCSleep>if you're coding in C++, I can definitely see that to be the case
(06:18:27)<jomiolto>I code in plain C
(06:19:12)<jomiolto>I don't really know where all the code goes, but I've managed to double the code base of an earlier roguelike without introducing any major features
(06:19:36)<jomiolto>perhaps one day I should analyze my old backups and see where all the code went, but that would take a lot of time
(06:19:45)<TMCSleep>yeah, it's really amazing how that happens
(06:20:56)<TMCSleep>abstraction is too dangerous, I can't say that I am any good at applying it
(06:21:11)<jomiolto>making good abstractions is really difficult
(06:22:25)<TMCSleep>I find that if I write some difficult abstraction, and then just drop the project or whatever, half a year later it becomes apparent to me why my code was bad, even though I never actually used it
(06:22:48)<TMCSleep>(a lot of what I write never goes anywhere :( )
(06:23:02)<jomiolto>pretty much the same thing with me
(06:23:52)<jomiolto>I often write some "nifty" code for later usage, and then when I intend to use it on something, I notice that it's pretty much useless junk
(06:24:40)<TMCSleep>yep
(06:24:44)<deveah>ooh, Shivering Isles in 5 minutes!
(06:25:00)<TMCSleep>at least, it's nice to know that you're a better programmer
(06:25:20)<TMCSleep>even though I never seem to get anywhere :P
(06:25:38)<jomiolto>just today I replaced my event handling code with something much simpler and smaller, yet it's still much more usefull than the old code
(06:26:17)<jomiolto>allows for more flexibility too
(06:26:45)<jomiolto>and I'm left wondering what I was thinking when I wrote the original code, because now it's so clear that it was an awful idea to write it like that
(06:27:57)<TMCSleep>there's something blinding about working out code
(06:28:02)<jomiolto>hmm, wasn't there a quote about something like this? "intelligent people understand complex things, but it takes a genius simplify it" or something like that
(06:28:09)<TMCSleep>prehaps it's just too fun to add complication
(06:28:34)<TMCSleep>yes, by Einstein I think
(06:29:16)<deveah>one minute!!!1!!1111
(06:29:31)<jomiolto>well, I don't know if it's fun, but at least I often get the feeling that I'm doing something really great when in truth I'm just over-complicating things
(06:30:31)<TMCSleep>yes, you try to be too clever
(06:30:40)<jomiolto>it's a bit like maths, I guess; you can calculate things in a really complicated ways, but if you take a bit of time to think about the issue at hand, you can usually come up with ways to simplify it
(06:33:05)<jomiolto>btw, did I ever mention that I'm working on a sequel to Alan's Psychedelic Journey? :P
(06:33:42)<jomiolto>it's not my top priority project at the moment, as I'm still gathering ideas for it, but I'm feeling hopeful that I can get working on it quite soon
(06:34:28)<TMCSleep>oo, you made that?
(06:34:35)<jomiolto>yes
(06:34:35)<TMCSleep>I'd forgotten who
(06:34:48)<jomiolto>the sequel is going to be called Fungi Island :)
(06:34:52)<TMCSleep>haha
(06:35:29)<TMCSleep>yes, some people on rgrd said that it felt like an introduction or prequel, didn't tehy
(06:35:42)<jomiolto>yes, I remember
(06:37:26)<jomiolto>I just wish I had more time for everything
(06:37:41)<jomiolto>I'm quite swamped with all kinds of projects
(06:38:15)<jomiolto>but at least it feels good to make progress :)
(06:38:28)<TMCSleep>yes
(06:38:35)<TMCSleep>5 at the moment for me
(06:38:44)<TMCSleep>(active ones)
(06:38:53)<jomiolto>5 roguelikes? or is that all your projects?
(06:39:05)<TMCSleep>no, only 1 is an RL
(06:39:43)<TMCSleep>2 games, a game engine, and 2 small programming skirmishs
(06:39:44)<jomiolto>I have 3 roguelikes, 2 other programming projects that I'd really like to get to and then heaps of other things (for example I like writing fiction)
(06:40:47)<TMCSleep>hmm
(06:41:02)<TMCSleep>why is it that we allocate far more time than we actually have? :P
(06:41:16)<jomiolto>because there are so many interesting things to do?
(06:42:00)<TMCSleep>having so many projects really gets in the way of doing interesting things though
(06:42:04)<jomiolto>if I dug up all my notes and ideas I've had for programming/literacy projects, I'd probably have more stuff than I could get done in my life time
(06:42:49)<TMCSleep>:(
(06:43:08)<TMCSleep>being selective is the best timesaver
(06:43:13)<jomiolto>yes, definitely
(06:44:21)<jomiolto>it's funny how I once estimated that I would probably need about 2 years for my grand roguelike project, and now 4 years later I'm yet to release even the first alpha version
(06:44:44)<jomiolto>and during that time I've had ideas for an even larger roguelike project :)
(06:45:37)<jomiolto>but I guess that is nothing compared to some other roguelike developers :)
(06:46:10)<jomiolto>some people started in the mid 90s and are yet to release a playable game...
(06:46:26)<joe6pack>that frozen-something dude?
(06:46:31)<TMCSleep>thinking back several years to where I thought I would be now is pretty depressing
(06:46:32)<joe6pack>what was it called?
(06:46:43)<jomiolto>kind of makes you wonder if that is something specific to roguelike developers or if it's something that happens in other programming circles as well
(06:47:21)<joe6pack>nah i think it's a characteristic of hobby programmers in general 
(06:47:22)<jomiolto>well, didn't Krice start Kaduria in 1994 or something like that? (of course all his time is taken by trolling, but anyway ;)
(06:48:28)<jomiolto>and when was GenRogue started?
(06:48:51)<joe6pack>kornel did release other games though
(06:49:07)<joe6pack>in the meanwhile 
(06:49:12)<jomiolto>well, that's true
(06:49:33)<Glowie>Not all hobby programmers, joe6pack :P
(06:50:25)<Glowie>Some know what they can't reach and select something they can reach
(06:50:26)<joe6pack>well of course not *all* :|
(06:50:34)<jomiolto>oh, and then there's Jade of course :)
(06:50:41)<Glowie>Jade is progressing fine
(06:50:43)<jomiolto>it was started around 2000, wasn't it?
(06:51:08)<jomiolto>I know it is, but it's still been under development for many years without anything released
(06:51:21)<jomiolto>well, except screenshots and such
(06:51:34)<TMCSleep>I doubt he really spent much time on it though
(06:52:32)<Glowie>I think Jade might even get to "fun" stage some day
(06:52:44)<Glowie>I'm a bit more doubtful about GenRogue and Kaduria
(06:53:13)<Glowie>After all, Biskup has created alone one of the biggest roguelikes :P
(06:53:18)<jomiolto>i'm not doubtful about my own roguelike project though ;)
(06:53:31)<jomiolto>as long as death doesn't claim me first, I'm going to get it released :)
(06:54:02)<jomiolto>Glowie: yes, and that reminds me that I'm yet to do the postcard quest :(
(06:54:09)<Glowie>Hehe
(06:54:14)<TMCSleep>that's a tautology
(06:54:35)<jomiolto>I was supposed to send TB a postcard after my first ADOM win 2001, but somehow I still haven't actualy done it :)
(06:54:54)<jomiolto>TMCSleep: ?
(06:55:28)<TMCSleep>well, of course either you'll release your game first, or you'll die first
(06:55:47)<TMCSleep>damn, getting hungry again. I'll never get to bed
(06:56:27)<jomiolto>hmm, yes, it is a tautology
(06:56:46)<joe6pack>what if he lives long enough to witness the singularity and get's uploaded into a computer network where he will live forever?
(06:57:00)<joe6pack>(and not finish his roguelike)
(06:57:14)<joe6pack>*gets
(06:57:30)<jomiolto>human life is just a tad bit too short for roguelike developers :)
(06:57:45)<TMCSleep>hahah
(06:58:25)<joe6pack>oh man
(06:58:35)<joe6pack>my bathroom is so much less moldy noqw
(06:58:57)<Glowie>I wonder how Biskup did it
(06:59:03)<joe6pack>i actually managed to remove almost all of the mold
(06:59:04)<Glowie>I mean, ADOM is huge and he did it all alone
(06:59:12)<joe6pack>tenacity 
(06:59:30)<joe6pack>you just need to invest a lot of time into it and never give up
(06:59:40)<Glowie>Easy to say
(07:00:01)<joe6pack>i mean nothing he did is very difficult by itself, it just requires amazing willpower to keep at it for years on end
(07:00:07)<Glowie>Yeah
(07:00:08)<Glowie>That's the thing
(07:00:17)<jomiolto>some people just have better focus naturally
(07:00:35)<jomiolto>or concentration is probably a better word
(07:02:08)<Glowie>I think I have quite good "willpower", but I still couldn't imagine myself creating something like ADOM
(07:02:51)<jomiolto>neither can I. My plans are much bigger :/
(07:03:16)<jomiolto>(and that's why I'll never get more than simple 7drls ;)
(07:03:22)<jomiolto>+done
(07:03:31)<Glowie>Why don't you get realistic and just plan something you CAN tackle? :P
(07:03:41)<jomiolto>where's the fun in that?
(07:04:24)<Glowie>You'll get something done :<
(07:04:29)<StarFire>Couldn't one start with a simple 7DRL and build on that?
(07:04:33)<Glowie>Show the world you're not just another dreamer
(07:04:39)<Glowie>Sure could
(07:04:56)<jomiolto>nah, that would be lying, because I am a dreamer :)
(07:04:57)<Glowie>Though I like getting a good infrastructure first, and 7DRL kinda rushes that phase
(07:05:01)<Glowie>Hehe
(07:05:41)<jomiolto>but I'm actually doing something I can tackle at the moment (hopefully)
(07:05:49)<Glowie>Yay
(07:05:49)<jomiolto>my current project is actually quite simple
(07:06:36)<StarFire>My last RL project died because I first spent a lot of time making a super-general infrastructure first, and then I got bored because I failed to create a satisfying dungeon generator.
(07:06:37)<jomiolto>but I have to concentrate on my library at the same time, and that slows it down a bit
(07:07:47)<Glowie>I took the middle path with infrastructure, not super generic, not rushed, but something that does what I want, though is at times a bit hard to extend
(07:08:01)<TMCSleep>uh oh. That's exactly where I am at the moment
(07:08:16)<Glowie>With me or StarFire? :P
(07:08:30)<joe6pack>StarFire i assume
(07:08:33)<StarFire>I tried to make it do everything I could conceive without any ugly hacks. I think it was pretty good, but it was super slow.
(07:08:35)<TMCSleep>StarFire's infrastructure and map generator
(07:08:43)<joe6pack>otherwise there would be no "uh oh"
(07:08:59)<Glowie>Ah
(07:09:01)<Glowie>Good point joe
(07:09:23)<StarFire>If I only had known about BSP map generation at the time. :)
(07:09:24)<Glowie>I'm not afraid of hacks if the thing still works like I want it to
(07:10:54)<jomiolto>I'm afraid of hags :(
(07:11:14)<StarFire>I'm now convinced that I should have a more focused and simple design, instead of trying to account for everything beforehand.
(07:11:15)<Glowie>I kinda like them :P
(07:12:44)<Glowie>An extensive plan is very useful, that way you don't end up creating a too generic engine that you don't even use to its full extent
(07:14:09)<TMCSleep>having a quick and amendable design is probably better than trying to be entirely generic right off the bat
(07:14:53)<jomiolto>hmm, I think I'll make some tea and get back to coding...
(07:15:08)<Glowie>Earl Gray ftw
(07:15:15)<TMCSleep>I'm too scared of having to modify code later,
(07:15:25)<jomiolto>Glowie: that's exactly what I'm having :)
(07:15:30)<Glowie>\o/
(07:15:37)<TMCSleep>but when I actually do it on a large scale, it's fine, there's no problem
(07:15:50)<TMCSleep>I guess I should go to bed
(07:15:55)<TMCSleep>the cat wants breakfast
(07:16:09)<TMCSleep>'night
(07:16:30)<joe6pack>gn
(07:16:59)<TMCSleep>gn... I've never seen that before
(07:17:21)<Glowie>G'night.
(07:17:30)<jomiolto>'night... and don't let the grid bugs bite :)
(07:48:34)<deveah>Shivering Isles is such a GREAT game!!
(08:08:11)<Glowie>By the way, ido and Kadwiell, I found an English version of the Scorched Earth clone that was Finnish yesterday :P
(08:12:37)<joe6pack>Glowie: oh?
(08:12:40)<joe6pack>link?
(08:12:46)<Glowie>Sec
(08:12:55)<Glowie>http://www.playray.com/games/play/cannons
(08:13:05)<Glowie>A lot less active
(08:15:22)<Kadwiell>Nice
(08:15:28)<Glowie>Feel like trying?
(08:15:54)<Kadwiell>If we're feeling traditionalist, there's also a version of the exact same software on scorch.quickfox.org (though I don't know if changing servers will fix the bug..)
(08:16:33)<Glowie>I'd call the original one less balanced :P
(08:16:52)<Kadwiell>Balance being you winning five times in a row :)
(08:16:54)<Kadwiell>Not that I'm bitter
(08:17:09)<Glowie>It was your first time :b
(08:17:31)<Kadwiell>We can try again if you want to.. 1vs1 or does anyone else also want to join?
(08:17:34)<Glowie>At least I didn't win 5 times in a row because I won the first game like in SE
(08:17:45)<Glowie>I'm in the chat at the moment
(08:17:47)<purestrain>arrr
(08:18:07)<purestrain>how was that software called for journalists? layout for pages etc.
(08:18:18)<purestrain>i remember an open source product
(08:18:26)<Glowie>No idea :<
(08:18:43)<purestrain>ah, scribus
(08:18:59)<Glowie>8565 = Kadwiell?
(08:19:14)<Kadwiell>I think so
(08:20:13)<Glowie>Well we could start with 1vs1 and if someone calls my name, remake for more people
(08:20:24)<Kadwiell>Okay
(08:20:50)<Glowie>123 = password
(08:32:43)<Glowie>Okay calling out all cannoneers, who wants to bombard with me and Kadwiell?
(08:33:53)<Glowie>:<
(08:38:48)<Glowie>You can still come
(08:42:28)<joe6pack>Glowie: still?
(08:43:08)<joe6pack>on the new site or the old one?
(08:45:35)<jraregris>what's the url for the old one?
(08:45:44)<joe6pack>scorch2000.com
(08:45:53)<joe6pack>but let's all play on the same one
(08:45:59)<Kadwiell>We're playing the English-language version of the Finnish one
(08:46:14)<Glowie>.
(08:46:15)<joe6pack>Kadwiell: #8962?
(08:46:19)<Glowie>Sure we can remake
(08:46:20)<joe6pack>should i join that?
(08:46:38)<Glowie>I can remake a game
(08:46:48)<Glowie>http://www.playray.com/games/play/cannons
(08:46:53)<Glowie>This is link to the new version
(08:46:56)<joe6pack>jraregris: are you in as well/
(08:46:57)<joe6pack>?
(08:47:26)<jraregris>yeah, I'm in
(08:47:37)<Glowie>Okay
(08:47:37)<jraregris>so... what server are we using?
(08:47:38)<Glowie>I'll create
(08:47:45)<Glowie>http://www.playray.com/games/play/cannons in my opinion, fine with all?
(08:47:45)<joe6pack>Glowie's
(08:47:47)<Glowie>Okay
(08:47:48)<jraregris>ok
(08:47:53)<Glowie>Pick multiplayer, not duel
(08:48:02)<jraregris>'rait.
(08:48:02)<joe6pack>8964?
(08:48:09)<Glowie>The game name is RGRD, password 123
(08:48:18)<jraregris>I'm 0373
(08:48:19)<joe6pack>i don't see that game
(08:48:25)<Glowie>Created now
(08:48:46)<joe6pack>i don't know which one is me
(08:48:56)<jraregris>the blue one, i guess
(08:49:02)<Glowie>Kadwiell
(08:49:20)<Glowie>Joe?
(08:49:28)<joe6pack>6449
(08:49:45)<joe6pack>should i click ready to start?
(08:49:49)<Kadwiell>Coming in a moment
(08:49:53)<joe6pack>ok
(08:56:13)<jraregris>you know in 3d editors like 3ds, lightwave, maya, etc. you've got different simultanious views. like above, from front, from side.
(09:04:09)<jraregris>i got the idea that it might work for a 3d rl
(09:04:27)<jraregris>and i wondered if you ever encaountered such an idea?
(09:05:02)<Kadwiell>In ASCII?
(09:08:22)<jraregris>yesh
(09:08:40)<jraregris>if was doing manual labour, and that always gets me thinking
(09:08:54)<Kadwiell>I don't think it would work in 80x25 at least
(09:09:08)<jraregris>specifically i thought about a way to make dwarf fortress less confusing with the third dimension added
(09:09:31)<Kadwiell>But there was a platformer among the 7DRLs with a side view.. a bit confusing but it did work
(09:09:36)<jraregris>Kadwiell: no, i guess it would be more effective with a larger "resolution"
(09:10:44)<jraregris>if you've read 300 game mechanics, there's one where he proposes a RL where you enter a scorched-earth-esque side view when you attack with ranged weapons
(09:11:27)<Glowie>Sounds slow
(09:12:26)<Kadwiell>Yep
(09:12:58)<Kadwiell>I think you would have to make ranged attacks the focus of the game if you're going to include an entire minigame for it
(09:13:24)<jraregris>i were wrong, it wasn't presented as a rl-idea: http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=51
(09:16:08)<Glowie>A big RGRD multiplayer Worms Armageddon mayhem could be fun
(09:17:02)<Kadwiell>Oh, yes - I used to play WA a lot
(09:17:09)<Glowie>Me too on hot seat
(09:17:33)<Kadwiell>Can't remember if I can run it at the moment, though.. the CD drive on my Windows computer is broken
(09:17:48)<Glowie>You can get a "back up" torrent ^
(09:18:13)<Kadwiell>Heh, I think I have one of those as well, but I don't remember if it works online :)
(09:18:29)<Glowie>I think I've played a cracked one with direct IP connection
(09:19:05)<Kadwiell>Ah, right, that should work obviously
(09:21:02)<Kadwiell>Hm, on the 300-idea, it looks neat, but it's too vague to say if it would be neat to play..
(09:22:59)<jraregris>maybe i can mock up a screen of how i visualised it
(09:25:36)<purestrain>wuah, i found audio bug :-)
(09:28:25)<purestrain>i should have read the sdl_mixer documentation
(09:29:15)<Glowie>That's usually.. Useful
(09:30:00)<purestrain>yeah; maybe they shouldn't say 'channels' in Mix_OpenAudio when it means either mono or stereo...
(09:30:13)<purestrain>i thought 'channels' meant the actual number of simultaenous sounds
(09:30:39)<purestrain>nevermind; just a bug when using virtual box
(09:31:10)<joe6pack>we can play scorch 3d as multiplayer
(09:31:34)<joe6pack>there;s win/lin/mac downloads
(09:31:51)<Glowie>I haven't seen it
(09:31:56)<Glowie>Do you die on 1 shot in that too?
(09:32:03)<Glowie>in 1 shot*
(09:32:11)<purestrain>uh; long time ago i played scorch 3d
(09:32:13)<joe6pack>i don't remember 
(09:32:17)<purestrain>but i would take a turn ;-)
(09:32:27)<purestrain>no, you have energy instead of one hit/dead
(09:32:31)<Glowie>Okay
(09:32:40)<joe6pack>do you guys want to give it a try?
(09:32:52)<purestrain>i'll do
(09:33:14)<Glowie>Looks like it takes a while to learn how to play it
(09:33:16)<joe6pack>it's even in the debian/ubuntu repositoreis 
(09:33:20)<purestrain>i like games which can be played in window mode on the second montiro
(09:33:38)<joe6pack> apt-get install scorched3d
(09:34:22)<joe6pack>there's also atanks
(09:34:50)<purestrain>i'm just downloading scorch3d
(09:34:55)<joe6pack>ok
(09:35:00)<joe6pack>me 2
(09:35:06)<joe6pack>80% [2 scorched3d-data 48038512/58.2MB 82%]                         525kB/s 23s
(09:35:32)<purestrain>525kb... i'm paying for 16000mbit, but i only get 3
(09:35:37)<purestrain>aeh, 16mbit
(09:36:01)<joe6pack>download rate depends not only on my pipe
(09:36:11)<joe6pack>also on the computer i download from
(09:36:30)<purestrain>the fun thing: my provider knew that i can't technically switch from my former agreement (6mbit) to 16mbit, but let me do the upgrade
(09:36:47)<joe6pack>how much kb/s do you normally get?
(09:36:53)<joe6pack>when downloading?
(09:37:05)<purestrain>~300-400 i think
(09:37:08)<joe6pack>i mean in real usage not theoretical 
(09:37:10)<joe6pack>ok
(09:37:16)<joe6pack>i get a bit more but not much
(09:37:18)<Kadwiell>Hmm.. I'm a skeptic on Scorched clones in 3D, but I'll give it a try if I can run it
(09:37:29)<purestrain>... its easy
(09:37:36)<purestrain>and its fun
(09:37:40)<joe6pack>let's see if it works in a window
(09:37:54)<joe6pack>yup
(09:39:00)<purestrain>who starts server?
(09:39:35)<joe6pack>you
(09:39:54)<purestrain>no, that would require me to configure my router :-)
(09:39:55)<jraregris>is 0.1 the latest release?
(09:40:05)<purestrain>41.3
(09:40:17)<purestrain>you live some years ago i think
(09:40:25)<joe6pack>oh music
(09:40:45)<jraregris>:)
(09:40:49)<jraregris>foundit
(09:41:47)<Kadwiell>Is the title screen supposed to be a smooth rotation?
(09:41:55)<purestrain>i hope not
(09:42:38)<Kadwiell>Good, thought I was very hardware-underpowered there for a moment
(09:45:40)<joe6pack>ok this game is too annoying 
(09:45:57)<purestrain>annoying ?
(09:46:17)<joe6pack>how come nobody managed to make a scorch clone that's as good as the original in the decade and a half since it was released? 
(09:46:21)<joe6pack>the 3d controls
(09:46:32)<purestrain>left/right/up/down?
(09:46:37)<joe6pack>no the camera 
(09:46:42)<joe6pack>with the mouse
(09:46:48)<purestrain>forget about the camera
(09:46:50)<Kadwiell>There's worms, if you use the term "clone" liberally :)
(09:46:52)<purestrain>just join 77.178.204.139
(09:46:59)<joe6pack>i need to see where i am shooting to though...
(09:47:22)<joe6pack>just 1 moment
(09:47:32)<purestrain>i don't remember the controls either
(09:49:03)<purestrain>huh, do you have 41.2 ?
(09:49:05)<joe6pack>connection faliled
(09:49:09)<joe6pack>yes
(09:49:17)<purestrain>41.3 is latest
(09:49:36)<joe6pack>i have whatever was on the ubuntu repositories 
(09:49:57)<purestrain>who joined ?
(09:50:00)<joe6pack>i
(09:50:03)<joe6pack>but it failed
(09:50:05)<Kadwiell>Oops, was this supposed to be a 1vs1 between you guys? sorry
(09:50:11)<purestrain>no
(09:50:13)<joe6pack>no
(09:50:28)<Kadwiell>Okay
(09:50:32)<Kadwiell>Well, it was me :)
(09:50:45)<joe6pack>i'll d/l the new version
(09:50:50)<Kadwiell>It seems to run awfully slowly, but at least it runs..
(09:51:03)<purestrain>yeah, i must downgrade graphics too :-)
(09:51:38)<Kadwiell>Oh, also, annoying sound, I thought I turned that off
(09:51:39)<joe6pack>me 2
(09:51:50)<purestrain>so should we switch to 41.2 ?
(09:52:03)<joe6pack>i figured my laptop will be up to it since i remember playing years ago on a much older computers
(09:52:10)<joe6pack>*computer 
(09:52:13)<joe6pack>no
(09:52:19)<purestrain>joe6pack, i just pressed 2 / 3, and camera went fine
(09:52:24)<joe6pack>i am already d/l ing the new one
(09:52:28)<joe6pack>2/3
(09:52:28)<joe6pack>?
(09:52:40)<joe6pack>the number keys 2 and 3?
(09:52:42)<purestrain>yes
(09:52:52)<joe6pack>ok
(09:53:31)<purestrain>but i really have to disable some gfx features :P
(09:53:45)<Kadwiell>This is pretty unplayable on my part, sorry
(09:53:46)<purestrain>Kadwiell, shooting the wrong directon ?
(09:53:54)<Kadwiell>I don't really see where I'm aiming
(09:54:01)<joe6pack>i am playing on minimum settings
(09:54:05)<purestrain>press 2
(09:54:20)<purestrain>so camera follows your cannon
(09:54:56)<purestrain>maybe we should stop and switch to lowest settings first ;-)
(09:55:13)<purestrain>ah, you managed to aim
(09:56:00)<Kadwiell>Pressing 2 helped, but I'm already on the lowest settings
(09:56:11)<purestrain>oh, thats bad
(09:56:13)<Kadwiell>Don't think this is the game for me, sorry
(09:56:17)<purestrain>maybe lower resolution ?
(09:56:27)<Kadwiell>Okay for you if I drop out?
(09:56:35)<purestrain>no
(09:56:37)<purestrain>:P
(09:56:41)<joe6pack>NO YOU MUST PLAY
(09:56:50)<joe6pack>WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT!!!!
(09:56:57)<Kadwiell>Heh
(09:59:25)<joe6pack>ip?
(09:59:39)<purestrain>just join 77.178.204.139
(10:12:19)<purestrain>syntax_tn, download scorch3d and join
(10:19:53)<joe6pack>3 vs 2
(10:25:48)<syntax_tn>purestrain: sorry, i'm on linux, i'd have to compile. anyway, i got work to do, but maybe some other day
(10:30:41)<joe6pack>lol
(10:33:09)<joe6pack>5v0
(10:33:12)<joe6pack>oh yeah
(10:33:30)<purestrain>weapons of mass destruction are forbidden on my server, didn't you know?
(10:33:31)<joe6pack>although only 2 victories were real achievements 
(10:33:52)<joe6pack>the other 3 were just abusing the lack of balance :)
(10:34:09)<joe6pack>the death's head missle is several times bigger than our tanks  
(10:34:35)<joe6pack>that was fun
(10:34:39)<joe6pack>takes some getting used to
(10:34:44)<joe6pack>but a good game all around
(10:35:09)<purestrain>yes
(10:35:36)<joe6pack>the expensive weapons are seriously over powered
(10:36:13)<purestrain>you can customize it a lot, starting arms level, ending arms level, weapon scale etc.
(10:36:31)<joe6pack>ok
(10:36:47)<purestrain>next time i don't use the russian missile launcher, that was the problem ;-)
(10:38:19)<purestrain>but, yes, its fun... i'm not against playing around again some day
(10:41:00)<joe6pack>i'm up for anthoer round right now, but let's get others in as well
(10:41:15)<joe6pack>it's probably more fun with a lot of people
(10:43:45)<joe6pack>i have 1 more guy
(10:43:49)<joe6pack>from another chan
(10:43:57)<purestrain>should i host again ?
(10:44:01)<joe6pack>yes
(10:45:17)<purestrain>ready
(10:45:43)<joe6pack>where are you
(10:45:48)<joe6pack>i only see myself in the list
(10:46:07)<purestrain>uh
(10:46:26)<purestrain>wrong ip
(10:46:37)<joe6pack>again
(10:46:40)<joe6pack>77.178.204.139?
(10:46:47)<purestrain>yes
(10:47:08)<purestrain>one moment, i will host with 3 player minimum
(10:47:55)<joe6pack>tell me when
(10:47:56)<purestrain>ready
(10:49:04)<purestrain>i changed to increasing weapons level per round
(10:49:08)<joe6pack>are you Player 1?
(10:49:14)<purestrain>me ist purestrain
(10:49:22)<joe6pack>i can't see you
(10:49:24)<purestrain>ido (pending) purestrain (pending)
(10:49:25)<joe6pack>only myself and player 1
(10:49:30)<purestrain>maybe i'm player 1 on your side
(10:49:32)<joe6pack>oh there you are
(10:50:01)<purestrain>still waiting for a third one
(10:50:05)<joe6pack>yes
(10:50:28)<joe6pack>what does that mean? that we get better weapons for free every round?
(10:50:43)<purestrain>no, we can buy better weapons every round
(10:51:11)<joe6pack>22:56:49 <@Digby> proble: s3d/osx defaults to full screen, irrespective of my overriding  that in prefs, and also despite restarting it and shit
(10:51:14)<joe6pack>22:56:54 <@Digby> thus rendering me
(10:51:17)<joe6pack>22:57:10 <@Digby> unable to type in the ip, plus the clipboard doesn't work in it
(10:51:51)<purestrain>damned
(10:52:10)<joe6pack>he is coming 
(10:52:22)<joe6pack>i told him to write it on a piece of paper....
(10:53:33)<joe6pack>finally 
(10:54:51)<purestrain>doesn't it start ?
(10:55:06)<purestrain>ah he disconnected
(10:55:23)<joe6pack>??
(10:55:25)<joe6pack>why?
(10:55:30)<purestrain>don't know
(10:55:39)<purestrain>not responding for 60 seconds
(10:55:47)<joe6pack>yeah i saw
(10:56:25)<purestrain>well; i'm sorry, but i've got to go to bed now.. its getting later and later
(10:56:31)<joe6pack>ok
(10:56:50)<purestrain>so, cya tomorrow

(03:05:20)<TMC>it's happy hour again
(03:09:18)<greg>:)
(05:38:59)<joe6pack>Greetings, earthlings
(05:39:21)<joe6pack>i've made a pretty bug advancement today :)
(05:39:28)<joe6pack>*big
(05:39:53)<joe6pack>actually much more than i thought i would
(05:44:14)<TMC>a big advancement in bugs?
(05:44:20)<TMC>that sounds bad
(05:44:26)<TMC>or maybe you fixed the bugs?
(05:47:59)<TMC>:P
(05:48:47)<joe6pack>nope
(05:49:01)<joe6pack>i implemented a lot of new functionality 
(05:49:23)<joe6pack>(for my automated theorem prover, not my games)
(05:50:30)<TMC>:O
(05:50:32)<TMC>fun!
(05:50:44)<TMC>I'd like to write one at some point
(05:51:02)<TMC>is it partially functional?
(05:55:40)<joe6pack>yes
(05:55:52)<joe6pack>will be fully functional within days
(05:56:05)<joe6pack>for a very modest definition of "fully"
(06:12:46)<purestrain>another visitor - stay a while - stay forever
(06:13:52)<TMC>awesome possum
(06:14:18)<joe6pack>i'm off
(06:14:37)<joe6pack>can't spend friday evening in the lab :p
(06:15:00)<joe6pack>or wouldn't want to, anyway
(06:15:56)<TMC>:(
(07:16:57)<Grish>Hey guys
(07:16:58)<Grish>:)
(07:32:40)<TMC>hi
(07:37:09)<purestrain>hi
(07:44:34)<TMC>SPIES
(07:44:38)<TMC>I knew it
(07:53:31)<joe6pack>hi
(07:57:36)<purestrain>enough people for a round scorch ?
(07:58:41)<joe6pack>hrm
(07:58:43)<joe6pack>sure
(08:00:22)<Grish>I would play
(08:00:26)<Grish>BUT I CANT!
(08:00:28)<Grish>:'(((((((((
(08:00:46)<deveahi>i'd play
(08:01:14)<deveahi>joe6pack - are you playing right now?
(08:01:33)<joe6pack>we havn't started yet
(08:01:40)<joe6pack>but i am raedy for a game in ~10 mins
(08:01:49)<deveahi>let's start when you're ready
(08:01:52)<purestrain>mkay
(08:01:57)<purestrain>who hosts ?
(08:02:03)<deveahi>i will
(08:02:05)<TMC>hosts?
(08:02:10)<TMC>what are we playing now?
(08:02:22)<deveahi>just tell me when everybody's ready, to avoid the login timeout
(08:02:27)<purestrain>my mmo roguelike
(08:02:36)<purestrain>uh, make 3 player minimum
(08:02:37)<purestrain>or four
(08:02:46)<TMC>if that was true, I would be very happy
(08:03:17)<purestrain>hmm.. i'm every day thinking about how to do a roguelike in realtime
(08:03:23)<purestrain>even at work
(08:03:33)<TMC>have you ever played interhack?
(08:03:37)<purestrain>well; i did write a small lan-prototype at work ;-)
(08:03:47)<TMC>I wanted to try it, but I couldn't get it to compile
(08:03:48)<purestrain>no
(08:03:59)<Grish>purestrain
(08:04:10)<Grish>real time as in not turn based?
(08:04:20)<Grish>Cause thats what Im doing
(08:04:21)<Grish>:D
(08:04:27)<Grish>but with GUNZ!
(08:04:29)<Grish>CHEA
(08:04:33)<purestrain>of course real time as not turn based
(08:04:38)<Grish>Flamethrower is gonna be wicked
(08:04:58)<purestrain>but i don't know what technique i should use
(08:05:06)<Grish>:(
(08:05:22)<TMC>read up on on surreal time?
(08:05:53)<purestrain>ah, surreal time... thats evil
(08:06:06)<purestrain>i wouldn't like to play such a game :-)
(08:08:20)<TMC>well I'd like to see what it actually plays like
(08:08:33)<TMC>I wonder why interhack disappeared so mysteriously
(08:13:17)<Grish>what is surreal time?
(08:18:23)<TMC>oh, wouldn't you know it? interhack was mentioned in an atplay column this month!
(08:21:13)<TMC>and I just discovered this:
(08:21:13)<TMC>http://sourceforge.net/projects/hacknet/
(08:23:28)<purestrain>the problem of realtime is, that you don't have a relaxing gameplay
(08:24:32)<purestrain>and should movement kept tilebased? should actions be abortable ?
(08:24:56)<TMC>actually, I am considering abortable turnbased actions
(08:25:45)<purestrain>i thought of it, too... like 'reflexes' where the player could abort movement if an enemy comes into sight
(08:26:12)<purestrain>with a % chance of a 'do you want to abort your action' - question
(08:26:52)<purestrain>would it be playable if every online-player has limited freezetime ?
(08:27:04)<purestrain>and if the players would be forces to work as a group ?
(08:27:37)<purestrain>well; what about scorch3d now ?
(08:27:39)<joe6pack>ok
(08:27:41)<joe6pack>ready
(08:27:51)<TMC>scorch3d?
(08:27:53)<purestrain>me too, someone should host
(08:28:21)<purestrain>yes, scorch3d
(08:28:32)<TMC>umm
(08:28:37)<joe6pack>scorch*ed*3d
(08:28:45)<joe6pack>scorch3d is a different game
(08:29:12)<purestrain>right
(08:30:05)<joe6pack>ok who hosts
(08:30:07)<joe6pack>?
(08:30:16)<purestrain>deveahi,wanted ?
(08:30:51)<TMC>wow, this looks beyond my computer
(08:31:06)<purestrain>it is beyond my computer, too
(08:31:18)<purestrain>playing on almost lowest graphics detail :-)
(08:32:08)<joe6pack>me 2
(08:32:25)<purestrain>thats why we all are playing roguelikes, isn't it ? ;-)
(08:32:41)<TMC>well, no
(08:32:47)<TMC>I like halflife :P
(08:33:03)<TMC>grish: sorry, I can't find the surreal time document for you
(08:33:10)<purestrain>i could plug in my good graphics card, but its damn loud
(08:33:22)<TMC>it's somewhere on the rl news site (at archive.org)
(08:33:34)<purestrain>tmc, would you like to join scorched3d?
(08:33:38)<TMC>see, you have a graphics card!
(08:33:46)<TMC>apparently even one with a fan on it!
(08:34:12)<purestrain>yes; but the only purpose is to sit in front of me on the table
(08:34:38)<joe6pack>so
(08:34:40)<joe6pack>do we play?
(08:34:44)<purestrain>yes we do
(08:34:52)<TMC>I'll join

(09:15:33)<Grish>how old is your comp?
(09:15:43)<TMC>only 7 years
(09:15:47)<Grish>LOL
(09:16:06)<TMC>no really, that's not much :(
(09:16:23)<TMC>I had another 7 year old computer, that was easily twice as powerful
(09:16:28)<TMC>but it died
(09:16:50)<TMC>guess they are just not made to last
(09:17:12)<TMC>even if they continue to work
(09:18:21)<Grish>heh
(09:18:24)<TMC>the problem is that it's 7 years old, AND probably the cheapest model dell made back then
(09:18:24)<Grish>I just build my own
(09:18:28)<Grish>so much easier and cheaper
(09:18:53)<TMC>buying old 2nd hand computers is much cheaper :)
(09:19:17)<Grish>but it prob isnt a good comp

(09:26:35)<TMC>I guess it must be under the nethack license
(09:29:14)<TMC>anyway, goodnight
(09:40:18)<joe6pack>my computer froze
(10:24:41)<purestrain>nice anyway
(10:24:49)<joe6pack>yeah was a good game the last one
(10:24:56)<purestrain>but i hoped the rollers would not bounce of your shield ;-)
(10:25:02)<joe6pack>with you teleporting like a coward
(10:25:12)<purestrain>would be my end otherwise :-)
(10:25:26)<joe6pack>i was quite proud about my shot at grish
(10:25:33)<purestrain>yeah
(10:25:36)<joe6pack>that 1st tracer landed exactly on him
(10:26:19)<purestrain>but i think nukes etc. are to overpowered
(10:26:27)<purestrain>too
(10:26:31)<joe6pack>yes
(10:26:42)<joe6pack>but with shields they are a bit less so
(10:26:54)<purestrain>yes; one round it took me 3 shields
(10:26:57)<joe6pack>cause you can withstand an indirect nuke quite well
(10:26:59)<purestrain>every round a nuke
(10:27:34)<joe6pack>i really enjoyed seeing the both of you wawsting all of your weapons/shields like that :)
(10:28:30)<purestrain>but i don't get why the game needs such big hardware
(10:31:28)<joe6pack>probably just not very well optimized 
(10:31:34)<joe6pack>or not at all
(10:31:49)<joe6pack>makes you appreciate the commercial games a bit more i guess...
(10:32:20)<joe6pack>they only run that well because they spend insane amounts of time and effort optimizing them
(10:32:51)<joe6pack>look at the quake source code
(10:32:58)<purestrain>its a mess
(10:32:59)<joe6pack>all kinds of crazy tricks abound 
(10:33:00)<purestrain>:P
(10:33:36)<purestrain>of course; with increasing hardware power you get lazy and forget about the smaller machines
(10:35:09)<joe6pack>it's not just about that, they just program it to the point that it works and that's it.
(10:35:29)<joe6pack>optimizing is less fun that developing new features 
(10:39:05)<jomiolto>my brother dropped me a box of old hardware, which was thrown away at the place he works at, and I believe this cpu was sold overclocked
(10:39:37)<jomiolto>because the processor (which i believe is cel 300A) has a huge heat sink and *two* coolers on it
(10:40:00)<jomiolto>I wonder if I have any use for this stuff? :P
(10:46:01)<purestrain>conquering the world
(10:46:03)<jomiolto>ati rage II, I wonder if I could run Oblivion with that :D
(10:46:31)<purestrain>reminds me of old wars... 16bit vs. 32bit
(10:47:02)<purestrain>diamond monster 3d ii ftw
(10:48:57)<joe6pack>jomiolto: the c 300A was ridiculously overcloack-able
(10:49:10)<jomiolto>I know
(10:49:16)<jomiolto>I can still remember that from the time :)
(10:49:45)<jomiolto>I remember also some computer manufacturers selling overclocked cpus and cheating customers with that
(10:50:15)<purestrain>uh
(10:50:19)<jomiolto>that's why I wonder if this was originally sold overclocked (the huge heat sink + fan would point towards that)
(10:50:19)<joe6pack>coolers == fans?
(10:50:23)<jomiolto>yeah
(10:50:42)<jomiolto>got messed up with the words...
(10:51:45)<joe6pack>"The new Mendocino core Celeron was a good performer from the outset. Indeed, most industry analysts regarded the first Mendocino-based Celerons as too successful‚Äîperformance was sufficiently high to not only compete strongly with rival parts, but also to attract buyers away from Intel's high-profit flagship, the Pentium II. Overclockers soon discovered that, given a high-end motherboard, the Celeron 300A could run reliably at 450 MHz. 
(10:53:48)<jomiolto>that single processor probably made overclocking ten times more popular than it used to be
(10:54:25)<jomiolto>although, I can remember trying to overclock a 66Mhz 486 processor to 83Mhz :P
(10:54:35)<jomiolto>managed to get it to boot, but it was never stable enough to use :/
(10:55:03)<joe6pack>i think i never overclocked any cpu i had
(10:55:45)<jomiolto>when I was younger I tried to overclock every computer I had with variable success
(10:56:43)<joe6pack>maybe i did ocerclock my pentium 100mhz,
(10:56:47)<joe6pack>i'm not sure
(10:56:48)<jomiolto>oc'ing a 120Mhz Pentium from 2*60Mhz to 1.5*83Mhz had a noticeable effect on speed, despite only clocking the processor by 5Mhz
(10:57:02)<joe6pack>but at any rate even if i did it didn't stay that way for long
(10:57:03)<jomiolto>(because of the higher memory speed)
(10:57:50)<jomiolto>I also used to underclock one of my pcs to make it run cooler :P
(10:58:00)<jomiolto>oh, those were fun times...
(10:58:26)<jomiolto>"those were the days"
(10:59:18)<joe6pack>i run my laptop now mostly at powersave mode to make it run cooler
(10:59:24)<joe6pack>but only in the summer
(10:59:31)<joe6pack>in the winter it's not needed
(10:59:58)<jomiolto>hmm, that's actually a good idea
(11:00:18)<jomiolto>90% of the time I don't really need most of the processing power of my laptop
(11:00:46)<joe6pack>i need to hook up with one of those industrial strength compressed air blowers
(11:00:53)<jomiolto>although, I'm not sure how much the powersave mode affects this one, as it has a Celeron processor :(
(11:00:53)<joe6pack>blow out the dust
(11:01:22)<jomiolto>dust? from your laptop?
(11:01:27)<joe6pack>in my laptop
(11:01:33)<joe6pack>it comes from the outside...
(11:01:35)<jomiolto>okay
(11:01:58)<joe6pack>i have a lot of dust in my apartment for some reason
(11:02:06)<joe6pack>maybe because i don't clean often enough
(11:02:12)<jomiolto>that could be the reason :P
(11:03:48)<jomiolto>modern laptops are really nice, btw
(11:04:08)<joe6pack> i'm sure they are...
(11:04:09)<jomiolto>the keyboards can be a bit cramped, but otherwise they're better than desktops in many ways
(11:04:17)<joe6pack>maybe if i get a stable income going
(11:04:20)<joe6pack>i'll get one 
(11:04:30)<jomiolto>lesser power usage, usually very quiet, etc.
(11:04:40)<joe6pack>i use an external keyboard with my laptop
(11:04:47)<joe6pack>but it is quite noisy 
(11:05:03)<joe6pack>of course i don't know if you consider an early 2005 laptop as modern
(11:05:08)<jomiolto>I have a noisy external one too, but most of the time I don't bother using it
(11:05:26)<joe6pack>no i mean the laptop is noisy not the keyboard
(11:05:31)<jomiolto>oh, okay
(11:05:43)<jomiolto>well, I have a noisy keyboard :)
(11:05:53)<jomiolto>2005? what kind of hardware does it run on?
(11:06:01)<joe6pack>amd sempron 3000+
(11:06:08)<jomiolto>ouch :/
(11:06:13)<jomiolto>don't those run quite hot?
(11:06:16)<joe6pack>512mb mem upgraded to 1.25gb
(11:06:29)<joe6pack>yeah i guess that's why the fan is almost always on
(11:06:48)<joe6pack>atm it is 46c THRS & 52c THRC
(11:07:53)<jomiolto>45C for me, most of the time
(11:08:21)<jomiolto>when it gets to 50C the fan starts up and blows for a while, until the temperature is again back at 45C
(11:08:35)<jomiolto>but most of the time the fan is almost totally silent
(11:09:28)<joe6pack>if mine ran 5c less it would have been totally silent
(11:09:47)<jomiolto>and I believe the low voltage core 2 duos are even better, expensive though :(
(11:09:56)<joe6pack>if mine ran 5c less it would have been totally silent
(11:10:06)<joe6pack>oopas
(11:10:09)<joe6pack>double post
(11:10:10)<Milesss>i have core duo and it's not much better
(11:10:23)<jomiolto>Milesss: is it low voltage one or regular?
(11:10:27)<joe6pack>a low voltage one?
(11:10:45)<jomiolto>I think there are three versions of core 2 duos for laptops with different voltages
(11:10:51)<joe6pack>are dells good laptops?
(11:11:17)<Milesss>one moment
(11:11:26)<joe6pack>or is lenovo better?
(11:11:38)<jomiolto>there: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_2_microprocessors#Core_2_Duo_2
(11:11:47)<Milesss>it's not low voltage
(11:11:52)<jomiolto>standard, low-voltage and ultra low-voltage
(11:12:27)<joe6pack>low-voltage, ultra low-voltage, super duper ultra low-voltage
(11:12:43)<jomiolto>I heard that the the low-voltage ones have good performance, despite only drawing 17W at max
(11:12:48)<jomiolto>joe6pack: :)
(11:13:31)<joe6pack>so which manufacturer would you recommend? 
(11:13:55)<jomiolto>no idea, I've only used Acer and I've been quite content with this
(11:14:06)<joe6pack>i have an acer too
(11:14:24)<joe6pack>it works ok but the build quality feels like shit
(11:14:30)<jomiolto>the only real complaint is the placement of the cursor keys, I don't like them being so small
(11:14:31)<Milesss>i have lenovo 3000
(11:14:38)<joe6pack>and i suspect it's quite poorly ventilated
(11:14:58)<jomiolto>hmm, what acer is that? they have quite a many models...
(11:15:08)<joe6pack>aspire 1360
(11:15:12)<jomiolto>mine is one of the cheap ones, aspire 5315
(11:15:33)<joe6pack>it cost about 1000 euro in austria 3.5 years ago
(11:15:42)<joe6pack>but austria is expensive in these thigns
(11:15:57)<joe6pack>it was one of the cheaper options i had at the time
(11:16:20)<jomiolto>in finland computers aren't very cheap either
(11:16:34)<joe6pack>in the us it would have probably cost a lesser amount of usd
(11:16:41)<jomiolto>yeah...
(11:17:02)<jomiolto>still, I think mine was only 600 euros
(11:17:22)<joe6pack>can you bring an american laptop to europe and just buy a new power brick?
(11:17:23)<jomiolto>and now, six months later you can get the same laptops for 399 :/
(11:17:30)<joe6pack>cause that's the whole difference afaik
(11:17:46)<joe6pack>yeah prices have plumeted 
(11:17:52)<jomiolto>I think that might work
(11:18:01)<joe6pack>a few years ago you couldn't find *any* new laptop for 600 euro
(11:18:25)<jomiolto>yes, I remember anxiously watching the prices and wondering when would be the best time to buy :)
(11:18:41)<joe6pack>and i suspect that with things like the asus eepc (or whatever it's called) it's get even cheaper
(11:19:24)<Milesss>too bad most of them have intel atom
(11:19:28)<jomiolto>yeah, I'd really like to try one of those mini laptops
(11:19:37)<joe6pack>http://youtube.com/watch?v=WklcYJcqiFM
(11:19:41)<jomiolto>or netbooks or whatever their called this week :P
(11:20:00)<joe6pack>what
(11:20:05)<joe6pack>'s intel atom
(11:20:11)<joe6pack>is that like the celeron?
(11:20:36)<jomiolto>it's a very low power processor that is slow as molasses when compared to regular intel processors (even the low range celerons)
(11:20:51)<Milesss>it's very fast 486
(11:20:55)<Milesss>:)
(11:21:07)<Milesss>it even has turbo
(11:21:10)<jomiolto>:D
(11:21:21)<joe6pack>hah
(11:21:46)<joe6pack>i have never witnessed a turbo button actually change the speed of any computer 
(11:21:56)<jomiolto>?
(11:22:19)<jomiolto>I remember having one on my 486 and it dropped the clock speed to half of the normal
(11:22:33)<joe6pack>srsly
(11:22:41)<jomiolto>yeah, and it was still too fast to play some old games :(
(11:22:41)<Milesss>when you press turbo is sets speed to 16 Mhz
(11:22:52)<joe6pack>i had one on my PC XT and i think it had no effect
(11:23:09)<joe6pack>or not a visible one
(11:24:25)<jomiolto>kind of makes you think... old games ran too fast on 486 machines and yet 486 is nothing compared to the computers of these days
(11:24:52)<jomiolto>and that isn't more than ~15 years ago
(11:25:11)<Milesss>and vista is still slow
(11:25:15)<jomiolto>yeah
(11:26:16)<joe6pack>every new version of windows runs sufficiently slower to compensate for any advances in hardware made since the previous release of windows
(11:26:21)<jomiolto>one good thing about vista is the fact that it bumped the memory from 512megs to 2gigs on most computers :P
(11:26:36)<jomiolto>running linux on 2gigs is sweet :)
(11:26:56)<joe6pack>i am running ubuntu on 1.25 gb and see no need for more memory
(11:27:04)<joe6pack>although 512mb waws painful 
(11:27:07)<jomiolto>event with plenty of heavy apps you're left with 1.5gigs of cache
(11:27:13)<joe6pack>especially when running eclipse
(11:27:32)<Milesss>with 2 GB ram you can make 1.5 GB ramdisk and place there operating system
(11:28:02)<joe6pack>why would you do that
(11:28:10)<joe6pack>that would hardly improve speed
(11:28:10)<jomiolto>no need to load apps from disk
(11:28:30)<joe6pack>these days i don't think that will make much of a difference
(11:28:46)<joe6pack>also, you will 1st need to load up the 1.5gb to ram...
(11:29:02)<joe6pack>not to mention that 1.5gm won't get you as many apps as it used to
(11:29:07)<joe6pack>but anyway
(11:29:19)<jomiolto>yes, I believe that's why very few actually do that
(11:29:38)<joe6pack>modern operating systems handle ram quite well by themselves i thnk
(11:29:47)<jomiolto>unless you want to impress your friends by launching apps in couple of seconds
(11:30:03)<Milesss>wouldn't save power?
(11:30:12)<jomiolto>well, that's true
(11:30:34)<joe6pack>Milesss: no
(11:30:41)<jomiolto>but how much does a hard drive use anyway? I think it's quite little compared to cpu/chipset/gfx card
(11:30:48)<joe6pack>the os will keep the bits it needs in memory otherwise
(11:31:18)<joe6pack>try loading a heavy app once, then closing it and loading again
(11:31:22)<joe6pack>it will load faster
(11:31:45)<joe6pack>thus rendering your little premature optimization quite pointless 
(11:32:06)<joe6pack>cause you will probably just leave it less room in RAM to do its shtick
(11:32:14)<jraregris>jomiolto: harddrives needs to spin the metal disks. takes a lot of power.
(11:32:37)<jraregris>if your talking about that sort of hd-s at least
(11:33:06)<jomiolto>joe6pack: hey, that's nothing. there were instructions on gentoo forums on using some of your graphics card memory as a swap space :P
(11:33:13)<jomiolto>that's some real hacking :)
(11:33:19)<jomiolto>(although quite useless)
(11:33:29)<joe6pack>jraregris: yeah but in these days of big caches and lots of ram (and OSs that use that RAM) you wouldn't improve much if at all doing the pre-caching yourself 
(11:33:38)<Milesss>i remember reading that hard disk uses only about 2 watts
(11:34:31)<jomiolto>this seems to indicate that hd's use about 8-12 watts in use: http://www.digit-life.com/articles2/storage/hddpower.html
(11:37:17)<joe6pack>friday night and the channel is about as active as it ever been :p
(11:37:24)<joe6pack>we're such a bunch of nerds
(11:37:53)<jomiolto>and the fact that no one takes offense at that word just proves it further :)
(11:39:00)<joe6pack>hmm.. i have a nice fat book about game theory i wanted to read
(11:39:39)<joe6pack>my brother bought to me as a gift a few years ago but now i'm actually educated enough to be able to understand everything in it
(11:39:50)<joe6pack>i hope so at least
(11:39:53)<jomiolto>and I have a gentoo box to update (not updated a single package in about 2 months :/ )
(11:40:10)<joe6pack>i'm updating as we speak
(11:40:21)<joe6pack>43 packages
(11:40:35)<Milesss>its not much
(11:40:40)<jomiolto>41 for me, a tiny cli only installation
(11:40:45)<joe6pack>no only several days' worth
(11:41:06)<Milesss>after 2 weeks I have to download ~200MB
(11:41:35)<joe6pack>yeah open source software is moving quickly 
(11:42:39)<joe6pack>weird, it says on the cover it's for non-mathematicians but browsing through it i see it looks just like a math text book and has quite a few equations and matrices in it
(11:42:44)<joe6pack>not that i mind...
(11:43:03)<jomiolto>try reading the art of computer programming by Donald Knuth :)
(11:43:16)<jomiolto>the beginning of the first book is almost solely maths
(11:43:31)<joe6pack>that doesn't say it's for non computer scientist on it though :)
(11:43:50)<joe6pack>this one specifically states it on the back cover
(11:43:55)<jomiolto>okay
(11:44:23)<Milesss>does it have integrals :)
(11:44:25)<joe6pack>oh wawit,
(11:44:58)<joe6pack>it only says "unencumbered by technical mathematical details"
(11:45:12)<joe6pack>i have seen any but i only browsed it a bit
(11:45:29)<joe6pack>but normally they don't really play a role in game theory 
(11:45:35)<joe6pack>*havn't seen any
(11:45:55)<jomiolto>does that translate to "full of difficult mathematics, but I'm assumind you understand all of it, so I won't have to go into details"? ;)
(11:45:56)<joe6pack>it's quite a discreet branch
(11:46:15)<joe6pack>heh
(11:46:16)<joe6pack>maybe
(11:46:39)<jomiolto>game theory, as in programming chess AIs and such?
(11:46:47)<joe6pack>no
(11:46:58)<joe6pack>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory
(11:47:15)<jomiolto>oh, that thing
(11:47:17)<joe6pack>"Game theory attempts to mathematically capture behavior in strategic situations, in which an individual's success in making choices depends on the choices of others."
(11:47:32)<joe6pack>i will probably write my thesis on the subject
(11:47:43)<Milesss>"...philosophy..."
(11:47:53)<joe6pack>Milesss: sure
(11:48:46)<joe6pack>philosophy is big, it encompass problems that require strategic decision making as well
(11:49:39)<joe6pack>lol
(11:49:50)<joe6pack>the book is dedicated to john von neumann
(11:52:07)<joe6pack>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX_is9LzFSY
(11:52:34)<Milesss>it's something for me
(11:54:30)<joe6pack>good night
(11:55:13)<jomiolto>"I wish I was your derivative because then I would be tangent to your curves."

(06:15:32)<purestrain>it works, D is so damn great
(06:16:09)<purestrain>beside of the lots of compiler errors, its really really great :-)
(06:16:30)<TMC2>it is?
(06:16:33)<TMC2>what about it
(06:16:57)<TMC2>I only know that it has highlevel array stuff
(06:20:16)<purestrain>ah, lots of interesting additions compared to C++
(06:20:49)<TMC2>compared to the additions in C++, you mean?
(06:21:02)<TMC2>it's derived from C, not C++, right?
(06:21:15)<purestrain>no, c++
(06:21:32)<TMC2>oh, didn't know it was heavily into OO

(06:40:03)<TMC2>is D compiled? (and fast)
(06:40:11)<purestrain>it is
(06:40:20)<purestrain>99% as fast as C++ i would say
(06:43:11)<TMC2>it doesn't seem that popular though,,
(06:43:34)<TMC2>I don't think I've ever heard of anyone writing something with it :P
(06:43:47)<purestrain>because it is a fresh and fairly unknown language

(04:45:22)<joe6pack>damn you now i do as well
(04:54:55)<Grish>Hey guys.
(04:55:50)<joe6pack>hi
(04:56:22)<StarFire>Hi.
(04:57:11)<Grish>:)
(04:57:13)<Grish>whtas new?
(04:58:25)<StarFire>I'm trying to learn C#
(04:58:40)<Glowie>Why would you want to do that
(04:58:47)<StarFire>It looks very nice.
(04:58:54)<Glowie>C++ looks nicer :<
(04:59:05)<StarFire>No, it doesn't.
(04:59:09)<TMC2>hahah
(04:59:44)<StarFire>There's plenty of things to be said for C++, but looking pretty isn't one of them, IMO. :P
(04:59:58)<Glowie>I like the look of the syntax :P
(05:01:08)<StarFire>Well, it sorta resembles roguelikes, because there are so many different symbols. :P
(05:02:02)<Glowie>Brainfuck would be the only language I'd want to learn because of its look
(05:04:33)<StarFire>Lisp is pretty.
(05:05:06)<joe6pack>StarFire++
(05:06:55)<TMC2>operator overloading polluted C's prettyness :(
(05:07:12)<Glowie>Hint: don't use it
(05:07:42)<TMC2>especially streams << and >>
(05:07:51)<TMC2>no love for bitshifts? :'(
(05:12:20)<deveah>THIS is the goodlooking Brainfuck?!

(05:14:54)<TMC2>you know, P+++++ == 'I am Larry Wall'
(05:15:01)<jomiolto>hmm, wasn't there roguelike geek code?
(05:15:08)<TMC2>oh, yeah
(05:17:09)<jomiolto>can't find it :'(
(05:18:27)<Grish>wtf
(05:18:33)<Grish>is all that crap up there alla bout?
(05:19:44)<jomiolto>hah, found it: http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.development/msg/95b3ce91fb19825f

(05:20:09)<Grish>what is brainfuck?
(05:20:15)<jomiolto>a programming language
(05:20:18)<Grish>prob some joke I dont get
(05:20:21)<Grish>srsly?
(05:20:24)<jomiolto>yes :)
(05:20:43)<jomiolto>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck
(05:22:43)<Milesss>ocaml is pretty -- code forms itself into diagonal stripes
(05:23:19)<Grish>That is... interesting.
(05:45:01)<RotateMe>Grish, how are you coming along?
(05:52:43)<Grish>Pretty good
(05:52:50)<Grish>sorry if it took a while for me to reply
(06:02:54)<Grish>I think I have completely figure out how to draw on the offscreen consoles that I set up
(06:02:56)<Grish>:)
(06:05:05)<Grish>How is yours coming along RotateMe?

(06:57:02)<greg>hey it's a bit of columbo mixed with chuckie egg ;) 
(07:04:52)<RotateMe>LOL i did it with the counter at 979 :D
(07:05:29)<RotateMe>just shot some girl and she gave me the goddamn egg
(07:06:33)<TMC2>yeah, it's not that hard
(07:07:56)<RotateMe>i played it before but didn't really got anywhere
(09:09:33)<joe6pack>my automated theorem prover is almost done!

(09:13:42)<Grish>sure
(09:14:02)<Glowie>Sorry can't now
(09:14:40)<RotateMe>i have thirty minutes
(09:14:48)<RotateMe>i guess that's enough if we start now
(09:16:04)<joe6pack>RotateMe: do you have it installed?
(09:16:07)<RotateMe>oh but whats's scorched 3D?
(09:16:09)<RotateMe>ah dammit
(09:16:20)<RotateMe>how long does dl and installation take?
(09:17:25)<joe6pack>10 min
(09:17:27)<joe6pack>5 mins
(09:17:30)<joe6pack>depends 
(09:17:40)<joe6pack>go and install it instead of asking 
(09:17:41)<joe6pack>;)
(09:17:47)<RotateMe>im on it :D
(09:17:54)<joe6pack>http://www.scorched3d.co.uk/
(09:18:12)<deveah>not playing :/
(09:18:16)<deveah>busy :/
(09:18:36)<joe6pack>busy doing what? you're a pupil and it's the weekend...
(09:18:37)<RotateMe>kk will be ready in 5 minutes i guess

(09:21:39)<joe6pack>i have one on Thursday 
(09:22:00)<RotateMe>finished let's go
(09:22:26)<joe6pack>he is setting up the server
(09:22:39)<RotateMe>kk
(09:22:40)<joe6pack>the other player
(09:22:57)<joe6pack>will say when
(09:24:05)<Grish>ip?
(09:25:07)<joe6pack>Grish: he didn't tell me yet, he says he is setting it up
(09:25:45)<Grish>kk
(09:26:51)<Grish>NO GANGING UP ON ME THIS TIME!
(09:26:57)<Grish>:P
(09:27:29)<joe6pack>hey RotateMe, we only attack Grish ok?

(09:29:21)<joe6pack>me neither 
(09:31:21)<RotateMe>me neither :(
(09:31:32)<RotateMe>but i guess i'd have to forward 27270
(09:32:02)<jraregris>anyone of you ever been fiddelin' with ROM-hacking?
(09:32:07)<Grish>nope
(09:32:49)<RotateMe>jraregris: i read a guide on how to translate roms and i successfully ripped a tileset
(09:32:54)<RotateMe>both snes roms
(09:33:49)<joe6pack>try 84.114.134.61
(09:33:52)<RotateMe>ido: i guess i won't be able to finish a game now
(09:34:05)<RotateMe>but tomorrow is also a day
(09:34:53)<joe6pack>Grish?
(09:34:58)<joe6pack>can you get in to this one?
(09:35:04)<Grish>Oh I havent tried
(09:35:08)<Grish>is it working for you ?
(09:35:13)<joe6pack>that's my computer
(09:35:16)<joe6pack>so yes :)
(09:35:32)<Grish>ok lemme try
(09:36:02)<Milesss>you can use Hamachi to create virtual network
(09:36:33)<joe6pack>no it's woking

(09:39:20)<joe6pack>should work
(09:39:29)<Grish>its just hanging there
(09:39:43)<joe6pack>?
(09:39:46)<joe6pack>weird 
(09:39:54)<joe6pack>i opened 27270
(09:39:57)<Grish>lemme tr yagain
(09:40:05)<joe6pack>and the ohter player manager to join last time
(09:40:46)<Grish>there we go
(09:40:52)<joe6pack>yep
(09:44:13)<joe6pack>ok he should come soon
(09:44:27)<joe6pack>he was trying to play from his ibook
(09:44:32)<joe6pack>which gave hiom some problems
(09:45:03)<Grish>lol
(09:45:03)<joe6pack>he says 3 mins
(09:45:06)<Grish>k
(09:45:17)<joe6pack>he'll try from a windows pc
(09:48:05)<joe6pack>21:53:08 <Digby> ido
(09:48:05)<joe6pack>21:53:14 <Digby> i have to stand down
(09:48:05)<joe6pack>21:53:27 <joe6pack> why?
(09:48:05)<joe6pack>21:53:31 <Digby> i can't add the exception of 27270 to the fricking xp firewall, it claims its  reserved
(09:48:08)<joe6pack>21:53:40 <Digby> i have already added 27270 to my router
(09:48:10)<joe6pack>21:53:41 <joe6pack> turn off the firewall then
(09:48:13)<joe6pack>21:53:48 <Digby> eek
(09:48:15)<joe6pack>21:53:50 <Digby> ok
(09:50:03)<joe6pack>21:56:26 <Digby> scorched3d.exe has crashed
(09:50:06)<Grish>awww
(09:50:33)<joe6pack>:(
(09:50:48)<joe6pack>let's just do a 1v1?
(09:51:00)<Grish>I cant now, I have a cw to do in soldat
(09:51:01)<Grish>heh
(09:51:09)<joe6pack>:|
(09:51:10)<Grish>Guy just came in vent
(09:51:12)<joe6pack>arrg
(09:51:14)<Grish>Mebey after?
(09:51:17)<Grish>itll be about 20 min
(09:51:22)<joe6pack>he joined
(09:51:33)<Grish>lol bad timing
(10:21:54)<joe6pack>Grish: done with soldat?
(10:41:42)<Grish>actually
(10:41:44)<Grish>just finished
(11:34:58)<Grish|Coding>hey
(11:35:02)<Grish|Coding>anyone here
(11:35:08)<Grish|Coding>that can help me with libtcod?
(11:35:39)<joe6pack>*crickets chirping*
(11:35:48)<joe6pack>RotateMe should know a bit about it
(11:35:55)<Grish|Coding>Well, its just a stupid simple problem I hope
(11:36:21)<joe6pack>i've never used it, but i remember him helping someon out with it
(11:36:23)<Grish|Coding>Its just everytime I try to do a different while loop thats not the one that keeps the game window open, it locks up
(11:36:24)<joe6pack>(i think)
(11:37:08)<Grish|Coding>Oh yeah, he helps me out
(11:37:11)<Grish|Coding>but Hes gone
(11:37:12)<Grish|Coding>:'(
(11:37:18)<joe6pack>post on the news group. you're bound to get an answer since the author or libcotd is a regular poster 
(11:37:36)<joe6pack>*of
(11:37:48)<Grish|Coding>ah
(11:37:53)<Grish|Coding>well, its prob somethin stupid Im doin
(11:37:54)<Grish|Coding>:'(
(11:37:56)<Grish|Coding>figures
(11:37:57)<Grish|Coding>lol

(10:36:50)<deveah>found yer roguelike language
(10:36:51)<deveah>'A language based on a roguelike game such as NetHack. The language would be non-deterministic, since roguelikes are traditionally very random. "Programs" would be represented as a player - the interpreter would act as a bot going through the dungeon, functions would be learnable skills, and data would be treasure and junk found in the dungeon. Since permadeath is a feature of roguelikes, there is no guarantee that a program will succeed in executing, althou
(10:36:51)<deveah>ES succeed in execution, it would be guaranteed to produce an accurate result. To make things more difficult the program could only produce the appropriate result after successfully obtaining some artifact (e.g. The Executor) and leaving the dungeon.--wildhalcyon 14:44, 25 July 2007 (UTC)
(10:37:11)<deveah>http://esolangs.org/wiki/List_of_ideas it's on that page
(10:39:58)<purestrain>sounds like a mess
(10:56:59)<deveah>it is :)
(11:12:49)<greg>hi everybody
(11:14:03)<deveah>hi greg
(11:15:07)<purestrain>hmmm today my girlfriend made chili con carne, and i love it :-)
(11:16:31)<purestrain>and i'm making progress with my game/framework again, great day
(11:17:38)<greg>don't know this speciality, it is made with beans and hot chili sauce right ?
(11:17:44)<greg>and meet of course :p
(11:18:39)<purestrain>yes
(11:19:46)<greg>^^, where i am living we ate "blanquette de veau" or "pot au feu"
(11:20:04)<greg>you should try thoose french specialities they are really good ;)
(11:25:16)<greg>http://www.750g.com/fiche_de_cuisine.2.123.7004.htm :)
(11:26:46)<purestrain>i don't know it, so i don't eat it :-)
(11:27:24)<purestrain>thats the first of two points making decisions on what to eat
(11:27:36)<greg>:p
(11:28:04)<Aerton>hi there
(11:28:18)<deveah>brainfuck rules
(11:28:46)<Aerton>rewriting your RL in it?
(11:29:01)<purestrain>D rules
(11:29:04)<deveah>no way
(11:30:42)<deveah>actually i was thinking of making an esoteric language in which you can really program something
(11:31:34)<deveah>add,substract,multiply,divide,show as number, show as char, if >, if < , if =, jump and store user input
(11:32:02)<deveah>every letter (a..z)+(A..Z) is a var (integer)
(11:33:15)<deveah>"Hello World!" would look like + a 72;+ b 101;+ c 108;+ d 111;+ e 111;+ f 32;+ g 87;+ h 114;+ i 100;+ j 33;( a 1;( b 1;( c 1;( c 1;( d 1;( e 1;( f 1;( d 1;( g 1;( h 1;( i 1;( j 1
(11:39:12)<jomiolto>hmm, this morning I realized that it would be trivial to add support for multiple player characters to my roguelike
(11:39:53)<purestrain>hmm... just like adding "list of controllable characters = (1,2,3)" ?
(11:40:17)<jomiolto>woot?
(11:41:06)<purestrain>just only a thought... don't know how it could be harder to implement more 'player' characters ;-)
(11:41:35)<jomiolto>well, my old code had a totally separate entities for monsters and PCs, and  the PC code was pretty hard coded for just one player
(11:41:51)<purestrain>why does it?
(11:42:07)<jomiolto>in my current code player characters are just monsters with a human controlled AI, so adding several of them would be really trivial
(11:42:34)<jomiolto>and even the user interface should work with it
(11:45:32)<purestrain>the way to go
(11:45:43)<jomiolto>yeah, definitely :)
(11:46:09)<jomiolto>I don't know why I originally coded monsters and PC separately
(11:46:39)<jomiolto>probably because I had seen it done that way in some other game...
(11:47:23)<purestrain>uh
(11:47:47)<jomiolto>or maybe I just thought it would be easier that way
(11:48:11)<purestrain>i'm happy of never seeing code of other roguelikes
(11:50:24)<jomiolto>I'm not very fond of looking at the code of big roguelikes, but sometimes I like checking out some of the smaller ones
(11:51:26)<purestrain>i would, if i know if i could learn something... but mostly these games are written in a almost antique way
(11:51:47)<purestrain>or should i say 'retro' way ?
(11:51:51)<jomiolto>ever taken a look at Nethack source? ;)
(11:52:02)<purestrain>no
(11:52:10)<jomiolto>I don't know if others are as bad, but Nethack is quite "antique"
(11:52:41)<purestrain>what about sharing your code? do you work in an oo way ?
(11:53:10)<jomiolto>sharing? I'm going to release my code under BSD
(11:53:18)<purestrain>where can i get it?
(11:53:28)<jomiolto>and, well, some of it is something like OO, but most of it's not :)
(11:53:30)<jomiolto>just plain C
(11:53:45)<purestrain>ah, ok then
(11:53:54)<jomiolto>um, well, it's available on the internet, but I'd rather not advertise it at the moment, since it isn't quite ready for prime time yet ;)
(11:54:24)<jomiolto>oh, actually the roguelike code itself is not, only the library
(12:00:00)<jomiolto>hmm, I need a dungeon generator :(
(12:03:42)<jomiolto>I think I once saw a cellular automata dungeon generator which made really nice maps, but I seem to have lost it...
(12:04:35)<TMC2>what kind of maps?
(12:04:37)<TMC2>caves?
(12:05:01)<TMC2>I've seen several
(12:05:23)<jomiolto>caves, yeah
(12:06:04)<jomiolto>something almost like the regular "rooms and passages" maps, but more cave like
(12:06:52)<TMC2>hmm, similiar to what was recetly posted?
(12:06:57)<TMC2>recently
(12:07:53)<jomiolto>you mean that jice's article? yeah, it was similar to that
(12:13:05)<jomiolto>"Dungeon generation is a simple task." well, that's nice :D
(12:13:20)<TMC2>very informative
(12:14:21)<Grish|Coding>Hey guys.
(12:14:29)<TMC2>hey
(12:14:51)<TMC2>what a disasterous cake
(12:15:08)<Grish|Coding>Oh man, I just woke up with a KILLER head ache
(12:15:24)<TMC2>heavily burnt, uncooked, falling apart and full of fluid
(12:15:32)<Grish|Coding>oh wow
(12:19:49)<Grish|Coding>Ok, My fucking compiler keeps tellign me there is a multiple definition of the function that I have.
(12:19:53)<Grish|Coding>Execpt there isnt...
(12:20:08)<TMC2>it doesn't list the places it's been defined?
(12:20:13)<TMC2>(gcc does)
(12:20:41)<Grish|Coding>it just says
(12:21:33)<Grish|Coding>Redefinition of Void UI(), then on a new line it says void UI() previously defined here
(12:21:40)<Grish|Coding>It was all working fine
(12:21:44)<Grish|Coding>then it started doing this
(12:21:46)<Grish|Coding>AGAIN
(12:21:54)<Grish|Coding>its doing it for ALL of my functions.
(12:22:36)<TMC2>did you accidently include a .c instead of a .h (or equivalent for your language) ?
(12:22:54)<Grish|Coding>nope

(12:23:18)<Grish|Coding>but
(12:23:20)<Grish|Coding>if i just
(12:23:21)<TMC2>"here": doesn't it say where?
(12:23:22)<Grish|Coding>do something like
(12:23:27)<Grish|Coding>change UI to UI2
(12:23:32)<Grish|Coding>it will say the same thing

(12:23:48)<Grish|Coding>the 4th time
(12:23:51)<TMC2>wait wait
(12:23:52)<Grish|Coding>its happened with this project.
(12:24:01)<TMC2>post exactly what it says

(12:24:48)<TMC2>ok, what it's saying is that UI() has been previously defined on line 6 of UI.h

(12:25:16)<TMC2>are you suuuure about that
(12:25:47)<Grish|Coding>Yep
(12:25:49)<TMC2>are you using #define and #ifndef to make sure each ehader is only included once?
(12:25:59)<Grish|Coding>yep
(12:27:19)<Grish|Coding>oh wtf
(12:27:26)<Grish|Coding>check this ou
(12:27:35)<Grish|Coding>the only file that ui was included in
(12:27:43)<Grish|Coding>the whole header
(12:27:56)<Grish|Coding>I comment out the #include "ui.hpp"
(12:27:59)<Grish|Coding>compile
(12:28:02)<Grish|Coding>un coment it out
(12:28:06)<Grish|Coding>and it compiled fine.
(12:28:08)<Grish|Coding>j.............................
(12:28:22)<TMC2>UI.h is included in ui.hpp?
(12:28:48)<Grish|Coding>its one header file
(12:28:52)<Grish|Coding>named UI
(12:28:56)<Grish|Coding>and the function
(12:28:59)<Grish|Coding>is also called ui
(12:29:14)<Grish|Coding>Now its working.
(12:29:19)<TMC2>but the error message you posted called the file "UI.h" :S
(12:29:25)<Grish|Coding>oh
(12:29:25)<Grish|Coding>yeah
(12:29:29)<Grish|Coding>the file is ui.h
(12:29:34)<Grish|Coding>so in the main function
(12:29:36)<Grish|Coding>err
(12:29:40)<Grish|Coding>main blah file
(12:29:45)<Grish|Coding>i uncommented where it was included
(12:29:47)<Grish|Coding>compiled
(12:29:54)<Grish|Coding>well, commented first
(12:29:56)<Grish|Coding>compiled
(12:29:57)<Grish|Coding>un commented
(12:30:00)<Grish|Coding>and it works
(12:30:04)<Grish|Coding>thats ALL I did.
(12:30:11)<Grish|Coding>God I hate this 
(12:30:14)<TMC2>:O
(12:30:19)<Grish|Coding>I dont understand why shit like that works.
(12:30:26)<TMC2>wow, maybe this is a problem with precompiled headers or somethin
(12:32:24)<Grish|Coding>Oh
(12:32:27)<Grish|Coding>wanna see something else
(12:32:31)<Grish|Coding>thats aggrivating me
(12:32:37)<Grish|Coding>I put in the line
(12:32:44)<Grish|Coding>#include <string>
(12:32:48)<Grish|Coding>at the top of my file
(12:32:50)<Grish|Coding>right?
(12:32:52)<Grish|Coding>So.
(12:32:56)<Grish|Coding>when I compile this line
(12:33:04)<Grish|Coding>string myString;
(12:33:06)<Grish|Coding>it says
(12:33:10)<Grish|Coding>string is undeclared.
(12:33:11)<Grish|Coding>...
(12:33:12)<Grish|Coding>BUT
(12:33:15)<Grish|Coding>if I put all of that
(12:33:21)<Grish|Coding>in my main.cpp file
(12:33:23)<Grish|Coding>It works JUST FINE
(12:33:28)<Grish|Coding>EXACT same code.
(12:33:33)<Grish|Coding>just wont work in ANY OTHER FILE
(12:33:33)<TMC2>namespaces?
(12:33:37)<Grish|Coding>11111111111111111
(12:33:38)<Grish|Coding>a;slkdfj'aslkdfj
(12:33:40)<Grish|Coding>I love you.
(12:33:44)<Grish|Coding>I think.
(12:33:57)<Grish|Coding>HA
(12:34:05)<Grish|Coding>Thats what I get for programming when Im half awake
(12:34:06)<Grish|Coding>huh?
(12:34:07)<Grish|Coding>lol.
(12:34:19)<Grish|Coding>I think.
(12:34:21)<TMC2>yeah, I make that mistake all the time
(12:34:23)<Grish|Coding>I should take a break
(12:34:27)<Grish|Coding>and go eat or soemthing
(12:34:30)<Grish|Coding>Srsly
(12:34:33)<Grish|Coding>thanks for the help
(12:34:34)<Grish|Coding>:)
(01:42:45)<deveah>Brainfuck is the language of the future
(01:44:06)<Grish|Coding>lol
(05:17:55)<joe6pack>done
(05:17:58)<joe6pack>finally 
(05:18:28)<joe6pack>my automated theorem prover is (kind of) complete!!
(06:40:23)<the_ru>deveah: so what have you written in it?
(06:42:07)<deveah>well some infinite loop thingies
(06:42:18)<the_ru>that's really useful
(06:42:20)<deveah>tried making my own version
(06:42:20)<the_ru>but how about
(06:42:25)<the_ru>while (1); ?
(06:43:00)<deveah>i wrote a simple Brainfuck-like language interpreter in 20 mins
(06:43:04)<deveah>Binplus

(06:43:15)<deveah>01 increment by 1
(06:43:15)<deveah>00 decrement by 1
(06:43:15)<deveah>1x jumps x positions (a-z)
(06:43:15)<deveah>1- output as char
(06:43:16)<deveah>-1 output as integer
(06:43:18)<deveah>0- loop start (loops until the var is 0)
(06:43:20)<deveah>-0 loop end   (loops until the var is 0)
(06:43:22)<deveah>-- store user input
(06:45:51)<deveah>works pretty well

(06:53:16)<Grish|Coding>too many 1s and 0s
(06:53:33)<deveah>the result is extremely short :)
(06:53:53)<Grish|Coding>i bet it says

(08:17:29)<jomiolto>and pulling the plug wouldn't exactly shut down my laptop, now would it? ;)

(02:15:55)<jraregris>bah
(02:15:59)<jraregris>not so good
(02:16:30)<Grish|Coding>Why is that?
(03:01:18)<jraregris>Grish|Eat: girlfriend problems
(03:01:27)<jraregris>entirely my own fault
(09:50:36)<TMC2>my computer crashed :(
(10:01:08)<TMC2>(that's a disaster - it took a day to restart)
(11:02:17)<deveahi>what's lambda calculus?
(11:03:28)<StarFire>If I've understood correctly, it's a model of computation.
(11:04:08)<StarFire>A minimal set of operations with which all computations can be described, or something like that. :P
(11:05:09)<StarFire>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus
(11:05:30)<deveahi>i understood that too, but how does it work, and how come most esoteric languages are based on it?
(11:06:32)<deveahi>this looks nice too: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtract_and_branch_if_negative#Subtract_and_branch_if_negative
(11:06:59)<StarFire>I wouldn't count languages like Lisp, ML and Haskell 'esoteric'. :P
(11:07:48)<deveahi>Malbolge is the most esoteric of all
(11:09:47)<StarFire>But what do you mean 'how does it work' ?
(11:11:47)<deveahi>i've seen languages like Unlambda, which are based on that lambda calculus
(11:12:04)<deveahi>and how do they work with one function (lambda) ?
(11:13:43)<StarFire>Lambda is not a function, but a notation to write functions with.
(11:13:54)<deveahi>yes, that's what i meant
(11:14:12)<deveahi>Unlamda is something like a'bx''c''a'bc''''a
(11:14:21)<deveahi>where ' is considered to be lambda
(11:14:31)<StarFire>I think it 'works' because it has been mathematically proven that expressions like that can describe any algorithm.
(11:14:38)<deveahi>this is the same to Iota and Jot, if i understood correctly
(11:14:48)<StarFire>I don't know the details very well.
(11:15:19)<deveahi>google for Iota and Jot
(11:16:48)<StarFire>Haha. :D
(11:17:48)<deveahi>"the smallest languages possible?"
(12:56:48)<Aerton>hi there
(12:58:18)<deveahi>hi
(01:00:50)<TMC2>'lo
(02:42:04)<deveahi>my brain hurts
(02:42:20)<deveahi>i've been looking all day at esoteric programming languages
(02:42:43)<deveahi>i've found some quite interesting
(02:43:06)<TMC2>haskell will destroy you
(02:43:11)<TMC2>and it's not even esoteric
(02:43:38)<StarFire>http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html
(02:43:42)<TMC2>http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html
(02:43:44)<TMC2>haha
(02:43:46)<TMC2>beat me to it
(02:48:06)<deveahi>my brain still hurts
(02:48:45)<deveahi>i've also tried to make nmy own esoteric language with reduced commands, but still a language you can code in
(02:49:02)<StarFire>I've tried to study Haskell on at least three separate occasions, but I couldn't wrap my brain around the monad concept.
(02:49:50)<TMC2>I think I'll put haskell off
(02:49:54)<deveahi>i've ended up with Evilflea: select_var ; increment ; decrement ; divide ; multiply ; if sel_var=0 then jump 2 positions ; set_var and get/set input/output
(02:50:03)<TMC2>that page really did give me a headache when I tried to understand it
(02:50:29)<deveahi>the Cat program in Evilflea would look like: !-1~$0~@~@~!-2~$2
(02:50:56)<TMC2>" if sel_var=0 then jump 2 positions"
(02:51:03)<TMC2>is that an atomic instruction?
(02:51:14)<TMC2>is that what 2 means? :P
(02:51:20)<deveahi>well, i've said the explanations
(02:51:42)<deveahi>if i told you !+-/*?$@ ...
(02:52:21)<TMC2>neat
(02:52:26)<TMC2>you didn't mention ~
(02:52:41)<deveahi>~ separates instructions
(02:52:59)<deveahi>~ (Evilflea) = ; (C++)
(02:54:30)<deveahi>got it?
(02:54:33)<StarFire>It'd be funny if there was an esoteric programming language whose programs resembled roguelike screen dumps.
(02:55:00)<TMC2>create it!
(02:55:59)<TMC2>it could be a language where programs are matrices instead of strings of symbols
(02:56:00)<StarFire>Just imagine: you could paste a nethack screen dump into it and see what it does!
(02:56:06)<StarFire>Yeah, like befunge.
(02:56:36)<TMC2>even better if every possible screen dump was a valid program
(02:57:06)<StarFire>Yeah.
(02:57:27)<TMC2>now, how do you create a language that doesn't follow "garbage in, garbage out"?
(03:02:25)<deveahi>if it was a language with one function
(03:02:50)<deveahi>and when the function started, it outputted the last function's result
(03:03:32)<deveahi>and if all letters' ascii code in this language was equal to ucase(the_letter)-asc("A")
(03:03:57)<deveahi>to print "A" the code would be ! !
(03:04:23)<deveahi>(first doesn't print anything, it sets the result so that the next would output it
(03:04:25)<deveahi>)
(03:09:27)<TMC2>what
(03:09:33)<TMC2>what's the second ! for?
(03:09:49)<TMC2>wait....
(03:10:59)<deveahi>first - output: nothing; set value to 1 (A)
(03:11:19)<deveahi>second - output the already set var (A) and sets the value again to 1(A)
(03:11:21)<deveahi>clear?
(03:14:24)<TMC2>! is ascii code 33
(03:14:31)<TMC2>then what's the space for?
(03:18:57)<TMC2>this code sucks so bad
(03:19:41)<TMC2>what a disaster - and that's not the problem :(
(03:20:52)<TMC2>all that this SUB does is check whether you've killed all the enemies yet
(03:21:04)<TMC2>it's 13 lines long
(03:21:42)<TMC2>no, 10
(03:25:10)<TMC2>I am so incredibly angry that someone wrote this and now I am maintaining it
(03:28:10)<TMC2>oh f*** now I need to add that string of arguments to whole set of functions?
(03:54:41)<TMC2>changes in scope are infectious
(04:30:46)<Glowie>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aJY9iAD1rw  -- open at your own risk, it's about Spore's creature creator
(06:28:51)<deveah>oh noes
(06:29:01)<deveah>I met someone who is younger than me
(06:29:22)<deveah>and he's coding esoteric programming language interpreters :/
(06:29:56)<TMC2>you must catch up to him!
(06:30:11)<TMC2>surpass!
(06:31:41)<TMC2>I'd like to write an esoteric language which makes fun of object orientation by running object in separate threads, and letting them bred and multiply like strands of DNA

(07:32:23)<Grishnak>woot
(07:45:30)<TMC2>:(
(07:45:35)<purestrain>again i'm thinking about making my rogue game in realtime
(07:45:46)<purestrain>but that would require e.g. mouse aiming
(07:46:04)<TMC2>semi realtime?
(07:46:10)<TMC2>(how about)
(07:46:26)<purestrain>for singleplayer, yes, but not for multiplayer
(07:46:33)<TMC2>:O
(07:46:38)<TMC2>yay multiplayer!
(07:51:07)<TMC2>(I think maybe we've already had this conversion twice)
(07:51:24)<purestrain>yes
(07:51:31)<TMC2>:P
(07:51:37)<purestrain>and again and again its starting all over
(07:51:45)<TMC2>my memory is appalling
(07:51:52)<purestrain>i think realtime and multiplayer would be nice, but on the other side it will destroy the rogueish feeling
(07:53:11)<purestrain>but i would like to have the tense of realtime games
(07:53:21)<purestrain>but it would also require more processing power
(07:53:23)<purestrain>arrrrr
(08:01:37)<Grishnak>Yeah, Im making a real time RL
(08:01:39)<Grishnak>:)
(08:01:47)<Grishnak>I might have it slighty slower
(08:01:54)<Grishnak>so its easier to think for a second
(08:01:58)<Grishnak>so you can react
(08:02:20)<Grishnak>real time will be cool for adding puzzles and stuff that have to be complete quickly
(08:03:35)<Grishnak>You can also make a RL feel more dangerous in real time
(08:03:47)<Grishnak>cause the player cant just simple sit there and think think think
(08:04:08)<Grishnak>Because perma death still is in effect, you ahve to be even MORE cautios
(08:04:14)<Grishnak>and play even smarter in real time
(08:04:31)<Grishnak>while you can still tone down the difficulty with out really toning it down
(08:04:39)<Grishnak>Because its in real time. :)
(08:05:47)<Grishnak>And real time is a nice change from the mainstream RLs (lol) and could add more playablity on the genre
(08:07:28)<Milesss>multiplayer realtime -- sounds quakelike
(08:07:48)<Milesss>i would like to see it
(08:12:02)<TMC2>hi ido
(08:12:07)<joe6pack>hi TMC
(08:12:16)<TMC2>how's the theorem prover? :D
(08:12:20)<joe6pack>done
(08:12:36)<TMC2>awesome
(08:13:06)<joe6pack>i mean i didn't implement 100% of the functionality but that's as close as i'm willing to go right now
(08:13:13)<purestrain>uh, i'm never thinking about quakelike
(08:13:19)<purestrain>only coop play please
(08:13:35)<Grishnak>what about a consentual dual?
(08:13:38)<Grishnak>duel*
(08:13:51)<Grishnak>one player askes, both players consent
(08:13:57)<Grishnak>ignores perma death
(08:14:05)<joe6pack>why is code.google so slow
(08:14:06)<Grishnak>can only be done in a safe zone like a town?
(08:14:24)<joe6pack>TMC2: svn checkout http://autoprov.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ autoprov
(08:14:29)<joe6pack>if you are interested 
(08:14:45)<joe6pack>i didn't bother cleaning up the code just yet
(08:14:48)<joe6pack>maybe later
(08:16:06)<TMC2>cool!
(08:16:26)<joe6pack>you enter the axioms in a text file 
(08:16:39)<joe6pack>and run python main.py nameoffile.txt
(08:16:56)<joe6pack>i have a short (very) example in axioms.txt
(08:18:05)<joe6pack>*short (very)
(08:18:17)<joe6pack>*(very) short
(08:18:19)<joe6pack>arg
(08:19:49)<Milesss>"RogueLife? is online, text-based virtual world imagined and created by its residents."
(08:22:54)<TMC2>huh
(08:22:55)<TMC2>?
(08:24:41)<Milesss>;>
(08:31:16)<TMC2>so, in P1[c1] or not P2[x1]
(08:31:29)<TMC2>is x1 unbound?
(08:31:37)<joe6pack>yes
(08:31:47)<joe6pack>x's are variables 
(08:31:54)<joe6pack>c's constants]
(08:31:57)<joe6pack>f's dunctions
(08:32:01)<joe6pack>*functions
(08:32:14)<joe6pack>i didn't use functions in my example but you can use them
(08:32:24)<joe6pack>and P's predicates 
(08:32:40)<TMC2>so does that mean P1[c1] or not P2[x1] for some x1?
(08:32:56)<joe6pack>for all x1
(08:33:11)<joe6pack>when no quantifier is given "all" is assumed 
(08:33:20)<TMC2>ah, confusing
(08:33:32)<joe6pack>if you want some you have to write exists[x1] at the beginning 
(08:33:56)<joe6pack>the example is trivial, it has no meaning
(08:34:00)<joe6pack>i just used it for testing
(08:34:37)<joe6pack>see how there is the "all[x1]" quantifier at the 1st line?
(08:34:47)<joe6pack>you can use exist in the same way
(08:36:43)<TMC2>and the conclusion is 'not P2[c1]' ?
(08:36:53)<joe6pack>yea
(08:37:03)<joe6pack>i need to improve the interface a bit
(08:37:18)<joe6pack>i just finished coding it yesterday and only worked on the logic
(08:38:49)<joe6pack>the conclusion is in CNF notation, i should convert it back to a string
(08:38:56)<joe6pack>next time i work on it 
(08:39:43)<TMC2>conjunctive normal form? since when did that use square brackets?
(08:40:02)<joe6pack>oh i use them for everything
(08:40:30)<joe6pack>it was easier to parse that way, because i wanted python to interpret the round ones normally 
(08:40:51)<joe6pack>should change that as well
(08:41:03)<joe6pack>to display them as round brackets 
(08:41:17)<joe6pack>as i said i just finished coding it... it is far from polished 
(08:41:30)<joe6pack>it just (kind of) does it's job
