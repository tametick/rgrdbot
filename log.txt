(Thu Feb 14 21:07:49 CET 2008)<dabreegster>it'd work more easily for text adventures. you go north in a room with no north exit and get the option to make a new room

(Thu Feb 14 21:08:18 CET 2008)<dabreegster>you slap a switch and get the option to code in a natural languageish script a reaction
(Thu Feb 14 21:08:30 CET 2008)<dabreegster>a roguelike might be tougher
(Thu Feb 14 21:08:49 CET 2008)<joe6pack>i think if someone wants to make their own game they will
(Thu Feb 14 21:09:03 CET 2008)<joe6pack>that's not why they *play* a game
(Thu Feb 14 21:09:17 CET 2008)<dabreegster>my main project is actually an engine. yeah, i know all of the criticisms about making engines and not games.
(Thu Feb 14 21:09:35 CET 2008)<joe6pack>IF specific languages are already natural langugageish

(Thu Feb 14 21:09:54 CET 2008)<dabreegster>but once i get a few things going, I'm going to make a bunch of 7drls with interesting ideas and just not have to worry about dungeons, movement, interface, LOS, pathfinding, etc
(Thu Feb 14 21:10:03 CET 2008)<joe6pack>it's a hobby, not a job 
(Thu Feb 14 21:10:07 CET 2008)<dabreegster>right
(Thu Feb 14 21:11:55 CET 2008)<joe6pack>dungeons, movement, interface, LOS,  pathfinding, etc -> a game ;)

(Thu Feb 14 21:16:04 CET 2008)<dabreegster>but making monsters with interesting attacks and keeping everything balanced so its not too easy but not impossible
(Thu Feb 14 21:16:10 CET 2008)<joe6pack>meh, "content".
(Thu Feb 14 21:16:33 CET 2008)<dabreegster>that gives me trouble. i want to encapsulate all the other stuff so i can really focus on getting the game to be "fun"
(Thu Feb 14 21:18:47 CET 2008)<dabreegster>my favorite rl to play is crawl because its so perfectly balanced. every game is difficult for a different reason
(Thu Feb 14 21:18:56 CET 2008)<joe6pack>mine as well 
(Thu Feb 14 21:19:15 CET 2008)<joe6pack>i managed to get a bit better at it today
(Thu Feb 14 21:19:27 CET 2008)<dabreegster>but martin's dungeon bash is another fun one, even though its much less complex. just because of the balance
(Thu Feb 14 21:19:42 CET 2008)<dabreegster>i've been playing it for four years and i'm still a noob
(Thu Feb 14 21:19:48 CET 2008)<joe6pack>haven't tried that one yet

(Thu Feb 14 21:20:52 CET 2008)<dabreegster>thats not bad at all
(Thu Feb 14 21:20:57 CET 2008)<dabreegster>what kinda combos do you play?
(Thu Feb 14 21:21:06 CET 2008)<joe6pack>human assassin 
(Thu Feb 14 21:21:16 CET 2008)<dabreegster>my faves are Deep elf fire/earthers, spriggan assassin (amazing class), and troll fighters
(Thu Feb 14 21:21:23 CET 2008)<joe6pack>before that i've tried tanger and monk
(Thu Feb 14 21:21:25 CET 2008)<dabreegster>if you like assassins, definitely try spriggans
(Thu Feb 14 21:21:33 CET 2008)<dabreegster>i like playing humans just to level up quickly
(Thu Feb 14 21:21:53 CET 2008)<joe6pack>what do spriggans do again?
(Thu Feb 14 21:22:14 CET 2008)<dabreegster>its just a race. they do a bunch of classes/roles
(Thu Feb 14 21:22:23 CET 2008)<joe6pack>yes but what are they about
(Thu Feb 14 21:22:30 CET 2008)<dabreegster>they move fast, pretty weak AC and HP wise, but they kick ass at stealth and stabbing and stuff
(Thu Feb 14 21:22:31 CET 2008)<joe6pack>are they the fairies?
(Thu Feb 14 21:22:49 CET 2008)<joe6pack>that's what i thought 
(Thu Feb 14 21:22:50 CET 2008)<dabreegster>the docs describe em as small elf-likes
(Thu Feb 14 21:23:11 CET 2008)<dabreegster>few things can stand a spriggan with a quick blade and high stealth
(Thu Feb 14 21:23:19 CET 2008)<dabreegster>you never have fights. just ambushes
(Thu Feb 14 21:23:25 CET 2008)<dabreegster>and when you do fight, you can run REALLY fast.
(Thu Feb 14 21:23:41 CET 2008)<joe6pack>i'll give it a try 
(Thu Feb 14 21:24:01 CET 2008)<joe6pack>shouldn't kobolds be good as assassins as well?
(Thu Feb 14 21:24:09 CET 2008)<dabreegster>dunno. i dont think ive ever played a kobold
(Thu Feb 14 21:24:29 CET 2008)<joe6pack>what *are* kobold supposidly good at anyway?
(Thu Feb 14 21:24:35 CET 2008)<joe6pack>seem pretty weak
(Thu Feb 14 21:24:38 CET 2008)<dabreegster>when i started crawl i would play naga venom mages. which was great to start with, but if you only focus on poison magic, youd be owned by dlvl 7 or so since more stuff resists poison
(Thu Feb 14 21:24:54 CET 2008)<dabreegster>hrmm
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:06 CET 2008)<dabreegster>they seem useless except for the fact that they gain experience as fast as humans
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:18 CET 2008)<dabreegster>which is really awesome once you're level 10 and need thousands exp to advance
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:41 CET 2008)<dabreegster>and while humans have average aptitude at all skills, kobolds are better at some magicks
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:42 CET 2008)<joe6pack>but don't they have more disadvantages relative to humans? 
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:48 CET 2008)<joe6pack>oh yea
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:49 CET 2008)<dabreegster>you're playing the latest stone soup, right?
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:52 CET 2008)<joe6pack>yes
(Thu Feb 14 21:25:53 CET 2008)<dabreegster>i guess their only advantage is the magic

(Thu Feb 14 21:55:59 CET 2008)<joe6pack>why not?
(Thu Feb 14 21:56:07 CET 2008)<RotateMe>you tell me :D
(Thu Feb 14 21:56:23 CET 2008)<joe6pack>it probably doesn't get it in onMessage
(Thu Feb 14 21:56:30 CET 2008)<RotateMe>that's why it would be better to add the logging to the sendMessage() method than having to log it manually everytime he sends something
(Thu Feb 14 21:56:44 CET 2008)<RotateMe>yeah maybe IRC works that way
(Thu Feb 14 21:56:51 CET 2008)<joe6pack>yes

(Thu Feb 14 21:57:03 CET 2008)<RotateMe>I always wondered why there isn't the slightest delay when sending messages
(Thu Feb 14 21:57:10 CET 2008)<RotateMe>no matter what connection you have
(Thu Feb 14 21:57:45 CET 2008)<RotateMe>probably it just adds your stuff to your own log and ignores messages from you

(Thu Feb 14 21:58:15 CET 2008)<joe6pack>RotateMe: it's not a proprety of irc in general, just of pircbot
(Thu Feb 14 21:58:27 CET 2008)<joe6pack>anyway, 
(Thu Feb 14 21:58:31 CET 2008)<joe6pack>to answer your question
(Thu Feb 14 21:58:41 CET 2008)<joe6pack>just overload sendMessage
(Thu Feb 14 21:59:25 CET 2008)<joe6pack>oh wait you can't
(Thu Feb 14 21:59:27 CET 2008)<joe6pack>it's final
(Thu Feb 14 21:59:36 CET 2008)<joe6pack>just declare another function then
(Thu Feb 14 22:00:07 CET 2008)<joe6pack>poublic void writeMessage(..){
(Thu Feb 14 22:00:24 CET 2008)<joe6pack>youstuff(); sendMessage(..);}
(Thu Feb 14 22:00:49 CET 2008)<joe6pack>and use that function everywhere you hav eused sendMessage
(Thu Feb 14 22:01:06 CET 2008)<joe6pack>instead of directly using sendMessage
(Thu Feb 14 22:01:10 CET 2008)<RotateMe>yeah, i thought of something like overload, but if that's not possible than this way is the obious way to go i guess
(Thu Feb 14 22:06:01 CET 2008)<RotateMe>k I commented the sources in joe6bot.java a bit and added a TODO and a IDEAS list (in form of comments)
(Thu Feb 14 22:06:41 CET 2008)<RotateMe>think that's it for today... my problem is that I can't leave my computer running :(
(Thu Feb 14 22:06:52 CET 2008)<RotateMe>it's hot and loud and in my room
(Thu Feb 14 22:07:33 CET 2008)<RotateMe>can you set up a permanent server if the bot is ready enough
(Thu Feb 14 22:07:38 CET 2008)<RotateMe>+?

(06:05:07)<konijn_nyt>ew
(06:05:10)<konijn_nyt>no
(06:05:13)<konijn_nyt>just no
(06:05:29)<konijn_nyt>text based is too hard to follow multiple channels on multiple servers
(06:05:49)<DaEezT>does icechat read out the words?
(06:06:02)<DaEezT>iirc all irc is text based :p
(06:06:45)<konijn_nyt>sure
(06:06:50)<konijn_nyt>it also reads my mind
(06:06:56)<konijn_nyt>filters are dirty content

(06:39:09)<joe6pack>on google code
(06:39:15)<deveah>link please
(06:39:28)<joe6pack>to the windows bin?
(06:39:40)<deveah>yes please
(06:40:12)<joe6pack>http://cryptrover.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cr.exe
(06:40:27)<deveah>thanks
(06:40:28)<joe6pack>haven't changed it much recenly, though 
(06:40:32)<joe6pack>np
(06:44:06)<joe6pack>these are rediculessly expensive aroung here 
(06:44:34)<joe6pack>like 3 or 4 euros 
(06:47:56)<joe6pack>deveah: should i go see "4 luni, 3 saptam√¢ni si 2 zile"?
(06:48:01)<deveah>yes
(06:48:12)<deveah>never seen it
(06:48:17)<deveah>but i heard it's great
(06:48:23)<joe6pack>hrm
(06:48:30)<joe6pack>oh damn
(06:48:45)<deveah>it's all about the bad things of my country
(06:48:45)<joe6pack>started 18 mins ago
(06:49:13)<joe6pack>so it's about everything in romania, then?
(06:49:30)<deveah>not everything
(06:49:40)<joe6pack>maybe another day. it only plays in one cinema and it started in 18:30
(06:49:42)<joe6pack>yea i know
(06:49:49)<joe6pack>just joking 
(06:50:07)<deveah>it's about a woman who wants to abort
(06:50:10)<joe6pack>my father is Moldavian, which is even more fucked up than being romanian 
(06:50:10)<deveah>i think
(06:50:33)<deveah>really? moldovians are romanian's brothers!
(06:50:57)<deveah>y'know, Moldova belonged to Romania in the first place
(06:51:00)<jomiolto>googled for the english name of the movie and got: "4 months 3 weeks 2 days = 144.7474 days" :)
(06:51:14)<joe6pack>:|
(06:51:27)<joe6pack>i don't think the moldavians would like that definition 
(06:51:39)<joe6pack>both were part of the ottoman empire 
(06:51:51)<joe6pack>iirc
(06:51:57)<konijn_nyt>hmmm
(06:52:09)<konijn_nyt>I paid 14 dollars for 2 sandwhiches :\
(06:52:33)<joe6pack>yes but these says 14 usd is 80 euro cents
(06:52:37)<konijn_nyt>of course, at the Times Square, everything is expensive
(06:52:39)<joe6pack>or so
(06:53:13)<joe6pack>4.8 euro - so it's about the same price i guess
(06:53:20)<joe6pack>even a bit more expensive 
(06:53:33)<konijn_nyt>yeah
(06:53:42)<konijn_nyt>oh well
(06:53:50)<deveah>joe6pack - what's your family name?
(06:53:53)<konijn_nyt>I make more money then when I was in Europe as well
(06:53:53)<joe6pack>i didn't remember subway being expensive when i was in the us
(06:54:01)<konijn_nyt>oh
(06:54:07)<konijn_nyt>relatively it is not expensive
(06:54:14)<joe6pack>deveah: my grandfather changed it in the 30's when he left Moldova 
(06:54:17)<konijn_nyt>every other option is even more expensive ;\
(06:54:33)<deveah>oh, then what was his name then? and now?
(06:55:04)<joe6pack>schuchmann
(06:55:09)<joe6pack>and today yehieli
(06:55:20)<deveah>oh
(06:56:01)<deveah>usually romanian/moldovian names end with -escu (40%)
(06:56:10)<deveah>like Popescu, Ionescu etc
(06:56:25)<joe6pack>i'm Jewish though 
(06:56:40)<konijn_nyt>huh
(06:57:11)<deveah>weird
(06:57:26)<konijn_nyt>yehieli seems to be a more judaic
(06:57:29)<konijn_nyt>name
(06:57:39)<joe6pack>konijn_nyt: yea, it's in hebrew
(06:57:50)<deveah>o.0 you've got me
(06:58:04)<konijn_nyt>things I read when researching Hellband ;]
(06:58:08)<joe6pack>why's that?
(06:58:16)<konijn_meeting>brb
(06:58:24)<joe6pack>have fun in your meeting 
(07:01:11)<joe6pack>i think i'll go watch this film:
(07:01:12)<joe6pack>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/
(07:01:22)<joe6pack>or one of these:
(07:01:24)<joe6pack>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472062/
(07:01:30)<joe6pack>http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0765120/
(07:02:18)<RotateMe>:O
(07:02:30)<RotateMe>rating for there will be blood is pretty damn good for imdb
(07:02:36)<joe6pack>yea
(07:02:47)<joe6pack>i think i'll go watch it
(07:03:06)<joe6pack>imdb is pretty reliable 
(07:03:09)<RotateMe>okay not the blueberry one
(07:03:12)<RotateMe>so:
(07:03:19)<RotateMe>decide blood,war
(07:03:19)<joe6bot> blood
(07:03:27)<RotateMe>have fun :D
(07:03:36)<joe6pack>that settles it then
(07:04:04)<RotateMe>recently watched "no land for old men" and "rise of the footsoldier"
(07:04:19)<joe6pack>excellent! it even plays in the cinema that's close to my place
(07:04:20)<RotateMe>liked both of them very much but i think they aren't on anymore, are they?
(07:04:41)<joe6pack>i wanted to see no loand for old man
(07:04:41)<RotateMe>yeah I think my sourcecode took that into account :D
(07:04:54)<joe6pack>but i was too late
(07:05:07)<RotateMe>pretty good movie... was hard for me to understand tomy lee jones... his accent is beond texan
(07:05:32)<joe6pack>i've also like 3:10 to yuma, which was the last film i've seen
(07:05:42)<joe6pack>pretty good, that one
(07:06:08)<joe6pack>oh wait
(07:06:09)<joe6pack>no
(07:06:11)<joe6pack>Into The Wild
(07:06:15)<joe6pack>that was the last one
(07:06:22)<joe6pack>3:10 was the one before that 
(07:06:35)<joe6pack>(both were good)
(07:07:27)<purestrain>arrr
(07:07:43)<RotateMe>hmmm 3:10 looks good
(07:07:47)<RotateMe>put it on my list
(07:29:38)<RotateMe>probably the worst decision in an early stage of DungeonHunter was to limit the maps to 50x25 ...
(07:29:58)<RotateMe>it's pretty hard to generate useful maps on such a small space
(07:46:36)<RotateMe>what do you think: http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/Screens/screenshot2.jpg (small rooms)
(07:46:42)<RotateMe>http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/Screens/screenshot3.jpg (midsized)

(07:57:46)<konijn_meeting>no
(07:57:49)<konijn_meeting>just no
(08:13:14)<purestrain>i feel that i should really try ubuntu again
(08:14:05)<purestrain>my thoughts are chaotic... on one side i want linux back, on the other is my windows system running and stable
(08:19:29)<RotateMe_walkin>k I'm leaving but i think i will leave the bot running tonight
(08:39:32)<deveah>joe6pack, jo6bot should have ops - you might want to give him serious tasks like kicking other bots or auto-voicing active users...
(08:39:42)<deveah>like TMAnna on EsperNet
(08:39:48)<konijn_nyt>hey hey
(08:39:53)<konijn_nyt>no kicking other bots !
(08:39:53)<deveah>Boten Anna :P
(08:40:02)<deveah>yes kicking other bots
(08:40:13)<konijn_nyt>fine, rogue bots he can kick
(08:40:16)<konijn_nyt>but no member bots 
(08:40:19)<deveah>especially the ad/porn ones
(08:40:23)<konijn_nyt>ew
(08:40:26)<konijn_nyt>yes
(08:40:44)<deveah>and especially NO cheap viagra ads
(08:43:26)<deveah>why is there silence?
(08:43:36)<konijn_nyt>?
(08:43:39)<konijn_nyt>I fully agreed
(08:43:44)<deveah>ok
(08:43:49)<deveah>joe6pack!
(08:43:52)<konijn_nyt>we only want expensive viagra ads ;\
(08:44:10)<deveah>ok, both then
(08:47:05)<deveah>it'd be cool "rogue of the day" in the topic too
(08:47:18)<deveah>fridge1drl first.
(08:50:38)<deveah>cya tomorrow; my current schecule sucks bigtime
(08:50:48)<deveah>no time for roguelikes *now*

(01:37:46)<RotateMe>:(
(01:38:11)<joe6pack>you should always fix bugs before adding features 
(01:39:01)<RotateMe>well feature in the sense of something that's missing that should already be there
(01:39:08)<joe6pack>like?
(01:39:13)<RotateMe>no core stuff
(01:39:19)<joe6pack>like?
(01:39:30)<RotateMe>;Smaller reqs:
(01:39:30)<RotateMe>;ooooooooooooo
(01:39:30)<RotateMe>;- add displayfloormessage to the options variables
(01:39:30)<RotateMe>;- better durability system
(01:39:30)<RotateMe>;- defense is to high and hit% to low (both in the beginning)
(01:39:31)<RotateMe>;- screammessages should be optional
(01:39:33)<RotateMe>;- bolts to target
(01:39:45)<RotateMe>these are the first 5 of about 40 or 50
(01:39:51)<joe6pack>i see
(01:40:03)<RotateMe>and bugs look like this
(01:40:03)<RotateMe>;=> BUGS:
(01:40:04)<RotateMe>;   skills may go through walls (if the first field is a wall)

(01:40:05)<RotateMe>;   check wether dungeon repopulation will be reseted when entering a new dungeon (?)
(01:40:27)<joe6pack>i never bother writing so much... i just write the first 3-4 bugs, fix those, and go on
(01:40:28)<RotateMe>you could take some reqs to the bugs section and vice versa but bugs are usually more nasty
(01:41:29)<RotateMe>well i usually add some content, play for about half an hour and note all bugs i encounter
(01:41:56)<joe6pack>oh i tought you were talking about the bot :O
(01:41:59)<RotateMe>the bug section isn't that big
(01:42:01)<RotateMe>:D
(01:42:14)<joe6pack>wondered how you've managed to write so much about it 
(01:42:26)<RotateMe>heh
(01:43:05)<RotateMe>;- defense is to high and hit% to low (both in the beginning)
(01:43:17)<RotateMe>that's a bot req :D
(01:45:53)<deveah_ubuntu>i ate bit.
(01:47:19)<deveah_ubuntu>joe6pack - what cat dir?
(01:47:50)<joe6pack>deveah_ubuntu: what what what?
(01:48:13)<joe6pack>cat /etc/apt/sources.list
(01:48:13)<deveah_ubuntu>the eta thing you mentioned

(01:49:46)<joe6pack>i highly doubt that's the answer that line gave you
(01:49:59)<deveah_ubuntu>what did you ask?
(01:50:11)<joe6pack>paste the answer to cat /etc/apt/sources.list

(01:53:29)<jomiolto>hmm, last night I had an idea on how to make "ray-casting with bresenham" los more "permissive", but now I seem to have forgotten it
(01:53:52)<joe6pack>deveah_ubuntu: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
(01:54:20)<jomiolto>btw, you can also use Synaptic to add stuff to repositories
(01:54:22)<deveah_ubuntu>i got it in gedit

(01:54:37)<deveah_ubuntu>same thing

(01:54:54)<deveah_ubuntu>how?
(01:55:01)<deveah_ubuntu>like deleting the lines?
(01:55:07)<joe6pack>delete only the #

(03:50:33)<joe6pack>is that yours?
(04:17:02)<RotateMe>nono
(04:17:12)<RotateMe>just found that
(04:18:15)<RotateMe>but it's uncompiled and i think in python so i won't try it, you know how lazy i am
(04:27:57)<joe6pack>there are compiled files in there
(04:28:13)<joe6pack>.pyc files are compiled 
(04:29:28)<RotateMe>ah so python too is one of those languages you need stuff for :(
(04:31:39)<joe6pack>like java
(04:32:37)<joe6pack>but it's normally more straight forward to run, what with java's classpath shenanigans and what have yous 
(04:32:58)<RotateMe>yeah, that sucks most
(04:33:25)<RotateMe>well in windows you can always put some .bat files along with the stuff you've made
(04:33:41)<joe6pack>with python it's normally just "python blabla.pyc"
(04:34:13)<joe6pack>in *nix that would be a shell script
(04:35:57)<joe6pack>mmm... these hazelnut waffles are delicious 
(04:36:20)<RotateMe>do you guys know dÔøΩner?
(04:36:27)<RotateMe>(doener)
(04:36:39)<joe6pack>the kebab?
(04:37:04)<RotateMe>yes
(04:37:15)<joe6pack>it's all over the place in vienna
(04:37:19)<RotateMe>it's awesome when eaten after 3 am
(04:37:33)<joe6pack>actually everywhere in germany & austria 
(04:38:13)<RotateMe>yeah i'm from germany but it's rare to find openened kebabs after 3am :D
(04:38:27)<joe6pack>i very rarely eat meat, and never had doener kebab
(04:38:41)<RotateMe>O:
(04:38:48)<joe6pack>but i've had shawarma 
(04:39:05)<RotateMe>ah that's great too
(04:39:06)<joe6pack>which is the arab version of the same sandwich 
(04:40:00)<RotateMe>i had some real strange tasting vegetables in there
(04:40:04)<RotateMe>kind of sour
(04:40:16)<RotateMe>couldn't really define what it was by looks and taste
(04:40:29)<joe6pack>which color?
(04:41:16)<RotateMe>dark yellowish cut in squares with about 2cm each
(04:41:21)<joe6pack>probably some sort of pickles 
(04:41:32)<joe6pack>maybe pickled pepers
(04:41:34)<RotateMe>yeah i thought that too
(05:07:58)<joe6pack>hey there eyenot
(05:12:24)<eyenot>hey j6p
(05:12:41)<eyenot>took a break from working on guts to get input/output done yesterday. 
(05:13:33)<eyenot>after a few added/removed missing/stray brackets, updating some renamed-function calls, and adding an argument in 16 incidences of an effects-check i forgot requires a floornumber argument...
(05:13:56)<eyenot>all like 3800 lines of so-far guts compiled fine, however, when i tried to dive into keypress catching i hit bottom
(05:15:11)<eyenot>i still have to smash together the various routines for segment generation based on the preordained rules i set down, and finish a few more tiers of artistic vision and challenge
(05:15:19)<eyenot>but other than that it's almost ready to go
(05:15:58)<eyenot>i came up with my missing impelment for the 3rd 1/4 of the game the other day and it will basically require an additional variable
(05:16:22)<eyenot>so today i sit down and work on a keypress parser seperate from the rest of the code. how are you?
(05:16:24)<RotateMe>eyenot, what are you working on?
(05:17:02)<eyenot>it was originally for the 7drl but it got too big of a gut and didn't even have a face, so now it's looking like a 30drl
(05:17:55)<RotateMe>does it have a name already?
(05:18:12)<RotateMe>or a special concept?
(05:20:12)<eyenot>i'm going to leave the name-dross, story, etc. for last. there's not really a special concept except that it's supposed to make up to me some things that bother me about rl's
(05:20:23)<eyenot>it's just a general-purpose dungeon
(05:21:12)<eyenot>i don't think many people will be very impressed with it, but i can almost gaurantee i'll play it a lot
(05:23:22)<RotateMe>yeah that's nice... i made RogueTower that way and it worked because i played it quite a lot
(05:23:57)<RotateMe>goddammit, fixed two bugs today and found two more :(
(05:24:32)<RotateMe>and one of those seems to be pretty big
(05:24:39)<eyenot>does roguetower have a page?
(05:24:49)<RotateMe>a RogueBasin entry
(05:25:02)<RotateMe>http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=RogueTower
(05:25:11)<RotateMe>win only, i hope that's fine

(05:26:46)<RotateMe>hah :D
(05:26:55)<eyenot>it looks interesting
(05:28:46)<RotateMe>well it's nothing revolutionary and it has no fov and random dungeons, i think i only had 1 free day during the 7 days
(05:28:56)<RotateMe>or better 8 days
(05:31:27)<eyenot>hmm
(05:39:08)<eyenot>i'm having trouble with getchar, considering it requires enter to parse
(05:39:18)<eyenot>i need something more instantaneous without resorting to ncurses 
(05:39:58)<eyenot>there just aren't many tutorials about input/output over terminals that don't rely on curses or ncurses
(06:01:59)<RotateMe>i can't really help you with your problem, but why don't you take a look at the ncurses sources and do it like they did it?
(06:02:49)<eyenot>i'll be fine
(06:03:06)<eyenot>i'm just going to have to use an int and a loop
(06:03:11)<eyenot>just being sluggish
(06:07:41)<joe6pack>eyenot: i'm fine thanks. why don't you want to rely on curses?
(06:07:50)<joe6pack>pdcurses has a windows pot 
(06:08:05)<eyenot>man...
(06:08:15)<eyenot>i don't want to rely on curses. :)
(06:08:19)<joe6pack>ok :)
(06:08:35)<eyenot>and i'm trying to ensure everything works over screen/tty
(06:08:46)<eyenot>i'm assuming ansi terminal
(06:08:52)<joe6pack>but it will be a major pain to make your game behave the same way cross platform without it 
(06:09:18)<eyenot>well it's ansi-c and i'm assuming ansi terminal, that sorts of meets the mark for standard for me
(06:09:30)<joe6pack>terminal emulators are nutoriously non-standard conforming 
(06:09:42)<eyenot>ansi's been around for too long for me to worry about it
(06:10:35)<joe6pack>have it your way. but i assure you your game will not work the same way on windows/mac os x/linux the same way out of the box
(06:10:37)<eyenot>if it doesn't emulate color it'll still receive characters. most keypresses are sent the same way
(06:11:14)<eyenot>i'm not too worried about it not working -in- windows, but if it were compiled as a dos application it would work fine 
(06:11:25)<eyenot>it's going to be source so what's the worry
(06:11:29)<eyenot>???
(06:11:37)<joe6pack>no worries :)
(06:11:47)<eyenot>did you think i was going to release a binary ?
(06:12:56)<joe6pack>i think you will spend a lot of time solving a problem solved many times before; i.e the incompatible way different operation systems and terminals handle keyboard input
(06:13:16)<eyenot>hmm
(06:13:21)<joe6pack>but i am looking forward to being pleasantly surprised 
(06:13:39)<eyenot>i see your point
(06:14:13)<eyenot>i will just let everybody know that when tested it worked in a standard vt100/ansi terminal in a linux screen session and that the code is ansi-c
(06:14:45)<joe6pack>okay 
(06:14:56)<eyenot>that input and output worked fine in puTTY and window's built-in telnet
(06:15:11)<eyenot>and as long as the user can set up a shell somewhere with GCC permission, they'll be able to play
(06:15:26)<eyenot>i really don't feel like setting up allllll the cases for everything else under the sun
(06:15:41)<eyenot>i think i'll just steal something out of nethack
(06:15:47)<joe6pack>:o
(06:15:50)<joe6pack>hah
(06:16:15)<eyenot>oh and the windows users will be able to play if they compile it as a dos application and have ansi emulation working
(06:16:21)<eyenot>so hey, both worlds
(06:16:59)<joe6pack>nethack keyboard handling -> danger will robinson!
(06:17:55)<joe6pack>that is a lot of fairly hairy code 
(06:18:22)<joe6pack>btw did you say you've written 3800 loc of c code?
(06:18:47)<eyenot>let me check
(06:19:00)<eyenot>3881
(06:19:09)<eyenot>i think it will be around 4500 w/o io
(06:19:13)<joe6pack>that's quite a lot!
(06:19:20)<eyenot>it's taken me two weeks
(06:19:32)<eyenot>err. almost two weeks... 10 days?
(06:19:37)<joe6pack>iirc the 7drl version of cryptrover was about 500 loc of c 
(06:19:54)<eyenot>well, there are some really long and complicated routines. 
(06:20:05)<eyenot>like one to determine all the cases of behaviour for a certain bug
(06:20:18)<eyenot>depending on its location in a given quad of a dungeon floor
(06:20:25)<eyenot>*shrug* it all had to be in there
(06:20:42)<joe6pack>bug as in "a bug in your source" or "the bug bites you! you are poisoned"? 
(06:20:54)<eyenot>bug as in a bug in the dungeon
(06:20:59)<eyenot>a firebug
(06:21:13)<eyenot>firebugs_routine lines 1128-1275
(06:21:23)<eyenot>head hurts, bbl

(08:04:21)<jomiolto>two hours into developing my 7drl and I've already found several bugs in my roguelike library :)
(08:09:57)<joe6pack>:)
(08:10:05)<joe6pack>you will probably find many more 
(08:12:57)<jomiolto>yeah, quite likely as I hacked the library together quite fast, wanting to get to 7drl development
(08:13:20)<joe6pack>i usually go the other way around
(08:13:24)<joe6pack>start coding the game
(08:13:43)<joe6pack>and afterwards extracts a "framework" from it
(08:16:40)<joe6pack>aka the Craptaculus Framework
(08:18:00)<purestrain>its the better method usually
(08:18:05)<eyenot>i will probably optimize my game before release with some kind of reusable frame
(08:18:16)<eyenot>it might even make the game better to have some things reusable
(08:18:44)<joe6pack>eyenot: will probably make your code better, i don't see how it should affect the game itself 
(08:19:02)<purestrain>i'm switching from C++ to D now; have to start from scratch again
(08:19:08)<joe6pack>:O
(08:19:14)<joe6pack>stop it
(08:19:26)<purestrain>too late; i felt in love with D
(08:19:48)<purestrain>and i hate these slow recompilations of about 1 minute just for adding documentation in any header file
(08:19:57)<joe6pack>YOU THERE! HALT! 
(08:20:03)<eyenot>i'm fighting for an ansi-c alternative to ncurses
(08:20:27)<eyenot>i was having better luck googling for help the other day
(08:20:27)<joe6pack>YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR THE CRIME OF SOFTWARE MASTURBATION 
(08:20:34)<purestrain>=D
(08:21:11)<joe6pack>eyenot: pdcurses is probably more modern/portable than ncurses
(08:21:16)<joe6pack>is it not ansi c?
(08:21:32)<eyenot>i hadn't heard it mentioned once yet in all this tutorial crawling
(08:21:42)<joe6pack>well you do now ;)
(08:21:46)<joe6pack>the magic of irc 
(08:21:53)<eyenot>i was just sitting down and working with read function from stdin to make my own keypress acknowledgement
(08:22:03)<joe6pack>so you've said 
(08:22:09)<eyenot>good point
(08:22:51)<eyenot>i tried to use ansi codes to get a noecho to work, but my terminal ignored it or something
(08:23:19)<joe6pack>purestrain: i suggest you dave yourself another 3-4 language changes and just program it in lisp already 
(08:23:32)<joe6pack>eyenot: what a surprise 
(08:23:39)<purestrain>next year perhaps
(08:26:03)<purestrain>but i consider lisp to slow for my target machine
(08:26:16)<joe6pack>that depends on the lisp
(08:26:30)<joe6pack>some implementation are as fast as c++
(08:26:41)<purestrain>nice
(08:27:03)<joe6pack>but probably still guzzle up more memory 
(08:27:10)<joe6pack>but that might not be an issue 
(08:27:20)<purestrain>i've got 64mb of memory available
(08:27:29)<purestrain>well.. i think ~50mb
(08:28:00)<joe6pack>well if your program would take up 400Kb in ran instead of 200Kb, that wouldn't make a difference 
(08:28:09)<joe6pack>s/ran/RAM
(08:28:38)<joe6pack>are you aiming for some handheld platform? 
(08:29:00)<purestrain>yes, gp2x
(08:29:15)<joe6pack>that Korean one?
(08:29:19)<purestrain>yes
(08:29:26)<joe6pack>i have never seen one in the wild
(08:29:52)<joe6pack>do someone actually own one of these things? 
(08:30:00)<purestrain>two are in front of me :-)
(08:30:21)<joe6pack>how many people do you know that have one or more?
(08:30:59)<purestrain>personal only one, but the community is steady growing
(08:33:18)<purestrain>but to be honest: i don't think i will never get a proper D compiler for arm running
(08:35:42)<eyenot>purestrain is that that all-purpose handheld/cellphone
(08:35:59)<joe6pack>some gaming handheld 
(08:36:01)<eyenot>a friend of mine was bragging about a cellphone/computer toy he had ordered from japan or somewhere
(08:36:20)<eyenot>how it could be configured to work with any existing network
(08:36:27)<eyenot>oh
(08:37:26)<eyenot>he was working out a cellphone network pyramid, and needed one of these devices to be the maintainer. he said in japan it's more expected to have a device that works for various networks unlike in america
(08:38:45)<joe6pack>eyenot: where do you sleep, if i may ask?
(08:40:12)<eyenot>lately i have sort of a hole in the ground somewhere 
(08:40:33)<joe6pack>and that works out?
(08:40:36)<joe6pack>in winter?
(08:40:41)<eyenot>i've found that this read from stdin doesn't echo if the terminal is busy displaying something else
(08:40:48)<eyenot>i've been out there all winter so far
(08:40:55)<joe6pack>damn
(08:41:07)<eyenot>last year or the year before i couldn't have done it. i had to prepare
(08:41:15)<joe6pack>i can't even stay outside for an hour in this weather 
(08:41:48)<eyenot>you don't acclimate?
(08:42:34)<eyenot>... the problem is if i'm running the read-in as a loop i have to set a delay that waits for the stdin to have a character length
(08:42:49)<joe6pack>i will probably get Pneumonia pretty quickly   
(08:43:04)<eyenot>this is hideous. i really don't want to include anything besides stdio.h
(08:43:12)<eyenot>i hate ncurses, it's old, clunky, and stupid
(08:43:26)<eyenot>i'd like to just grab getch from ncurses and keep that
(08:43:39)<eyenot>getchar is making me tear my hair out, it always waits for an enter key
(08:43:40)<joe6pack>pdcurses is new, and marginally less  clunky, and stupid ;)
(08:43:57)<eyenot>i might try pdcurses, just that it presents itself *as* ncurses on their page
(08:44:06)<joe6pack>what?
(08:44:18)<joe6pack>http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/
(08:44:25)<eyenot>err... it presents itself as 'curses'
(08:44:27)<eyenot>http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/doc/PDCurses.txt
(08:44:28)<joe6pack>where does it say it's ncurses
(08:44:34)<eyenot>sorry, mismemory
(08:44:58)<eyenot>i just want one single thing, a keypress reader that reacts once a key is pressed
(08:45:16)<joe6pack>i understand 
(08:45:27)<joe6pack>but i don't know of an easier way to get that 
(08:45:39)<joe6pack>other than to use some form of curses
(08:46:18)<eyenot>i could look at their source
(08:46:55)<joe6pack>i don't think the standard defines a way to get a char like you want to
(08:47:20)<joe6pack>so you will have to handle platfomr dependent crap *somewhere*
(08:47:40)<joe6pack>whether manually or using a library 
(08:48:32)<eyenot>hmm
(08:48:53)<joe6pack>ANSI/ISO C says nothing about it, so how can stdio implement it 
(08:49:06)<eyenot>well i can just read from the stdio
(08:49:08)<eyenot>err the stdin
(08:49:24)<eyenot>and for the most part the keys create the same codes across platforms, terms, etc.
(08:49:45)<joe6pack>i hope you don't want to use the key pad
(08:49:58)<eyenot>i only expect a few things: dos/linux, ansi translation enabled, vt100 or ansi terminal, etc.
(08:50:08)<eyenot>these things are so standardized i don't think portability should matter 
(08:50:14)<eyenot>i don't want ot use the keypad
(08:51:23)<joe6pack>eyenot: yea, only such minor terminals as the gnome-terminal, the kde terminal, mac os x's Terminal.app and possibly windows' console don't strictly conform to the standard. but who uses those anyway?
(08:52:04)<eyenot>i see coming up with this function myself as a challenge
(08:52:06)<eyenot>http://cermics.enpc.fr/~ts/C/FUNCTIONS/getchar.html
(08:52:28)<eyenot>there are a lot of sob stories like this, somebody trying to implement a single-key reader but not being able to. i plan to deal with it in a file or stream approach
(08:52:28)<joe6pack>godspeed, grass hopper 
(08:52:52)<joe6pack>may the source be with you
(08:53:08)<eyenot>anybody who can use xterm can emulate an ansi terminal. anybody using windows can run a dos app. the exceptions are very few.
(08:53:19)<joe6pack>ok
(08:53:36)<eyenot>ah i forgot. i already had this whole conversation with rotate-me ... so this is all over again
(08:53:47)<eyenot>for a moment i was going to say 'hey, i already covered this when i first got in...'
(08:53:56)<joe6pack>i think you may have even had it with me as well 
(08:53:59)<eyenot>oh
(08:54:09)<eyenot>i just figure, i'm sticking with a few things that are implemented just about everywhere
(08:54:19)<eyenot>the last thing on my mind is worries over portability
(08:54:23)<joe6pack>no problem. good luck. 
(08:54:26)<eyenot>ty
(08:56:23)<joe6pack>http://c-faq.com/osdep/cbreak.html
(08:57:15)<eyenot>all i really have to do is find a simply written source to something like getchar and take out whatever is forcing it to wait for the newline
(08:57:42)<joe6pack>look at the link
(08:58:32)<joe6pack>about in the middle they start showing the source code
(09:00:47)<eyenot>damn. i'm preempted
(09:02:47)<eyenot>what sucks is if i try to do anything BUT this one little thing, i have no problems. as long as i'm willing to accept linebreak input.
(09:02:55)<eyenot>this is the only hurdle.
(09:03:39)<eyenot>so far the program will work wherever C compiles and there's a terminal or screen. as long as i don't expect single keypress input.
(09:03:45)<eyenot>gd it
(09:07:26)<eyenot>this is so stupid. *in the special case of stdin* ... all sorts of standard c functions have been told to wait for the enter key.
(09:07:39)<eyenot>so it can't be treated raw like a file or stream without that happening.
(09:31:36)<purestrain>D really kicks ass.... D2 will be superior
(09:37:25)<konijn_nyt>greetings and salutations
(09:38:20)<purestrain>Ave konijn_dinner. Morituri te salutant.
(09:38:31)<konijn_nyt>Topic is: The official rec.games.roguelike.development channel | link of the day: http://kuoi.com/~kamikaze/GameDesign/art07_rogue_dungeon.php | current bot developer: RotateMe
(09:38:43)<jomiolto>"Morituri" ?)
(09:39:07)<konijn_nyt>garbled 'to die' I assume
(09:39:15)<konijn_nyt>mourir
(09:40:07)<jomiolto>I think literal translation of "morituri" is something like "ones heading towards death". That's why the question
(09:40:29)<konijn_nyt>it's a reference to the gladiators and the Caesar I assume
(09:40:50)<jomiolto>uhm, yes, I know, but why use that greeting? :)
(09:40:51)<konijn_nyt>we who are about to die salute you
(09:40:55)<konijn_nyt>ah
(09:40:57)<purestrain>yes, i don't know the proper english term: perhaps something like "the dead consecrated greets you" ?
(09:41:00)<jomiolto>ah, that's a much better translation
(09:41:44)<purestrain>ah, now i know the proper translation in english :-)
(09:42:14)<konijn_nyt>we used to greet our teachers this way before tough exams ;)
(09:42:14)<jomiolto>"Those about to die salute you." is another translation (sounds better, imo)
(09:42:20)<jomiolto>:D
(09:42:44)<jomiolto>well, I'm currently on a 7drl quest, so I guess it applies to me too :)
(09:43:11)<jomiolto>the clock is ticking and I'm... on IRC
(09:43:16)<purestrain>hehe
(09:43:43)<purestrain>well; i think i cannot take part of the contest
(09:44:38)<purestrain>perhaps i should make my whole framework for everything as freely available ?
(09:45:06)<ido>sure
(09:45:08)<ido>why not
(09:45:56)<konijn_nyt>of course
(09:46:01)<konijn_nyt>the more frameworks the better
(09:46:13)<purestrain>well, its not a framework for roguelikes ;-)
(09:46:21)<ido>the more available code the better
(09:46:57)<ido>you never knows where someone might need exactly what you've got and will stumble upon your code through google
(09:54:04)<purestrain>http://retroforge.de/~md/ released
(09:54:13)<ido>\o/
(09:55:37)<ido>"Its not buildable because i have no makefiles ready." <-- than how did you build it?
(09:55:44)<purestrain>codeblocks
(09:56:07)<purestrain>i've deleted the codeblocks project files
(09:56:24)<ido>why?
(09:56:38)<ido>now we can't build it at all 
(09:57:23)<ido>eek
(09:57:29)<ido>that is a lot of code
(09:57:49)<konijn_nyt>hmmmm
(09:57:53)<konijn_nyt>too bad
(09:58:02)<konijn_nyt>you know that codeblocks can export a makefile right ?
(09:58:07)<purestrain>no
(09:58:12)<konijn_nyt>darned
(09:58:19)<konijn_nyt>well, you know for next time ;)
(09:58:38)<ido>you can still update the file on your blag 
(09:59:25)<ido>purestrain: how much of that 959kb of code is your code and how much are libs?
(09:59:30)<ido>like lua and stuff
(10:00:31)<purestrain>lua and xml in framework/src
(10:00:43)<ido>so other that it's all yours?
(10:00:52)<purestrain>i think so
(10:01:01)<purestrain>ah no
(10:01:12)<purestrain>include/core/sigslot.h
(10:03:16)<ido>so about 247.5kb is yours
(10:03:28)<purestrain>o_O i never wrote so much
(10:03:56)<ido>959-(65.5+ 436.1+109+101)
(10:04:09)<ido>actually 959.1-(65.5+ 436.1+109+101)
(10:04:14)<ido>=247.5kb
(10:04:20)<purestrain>oh
(10:05:03)<purestrain>yes, then it is so
(10:07:32)<konijn_nyt>oh man
(10:07:45)<konijn_nyt>seriously, people are just so lazy
(10:08:00)<konijn_nyt>  /* The current level number. */
(10:08:03)<konijn_nyt>  byte dl;
(10:09:21)<konijn_nyt>why not currentDungeonLevel ??
(10:09:34)<konijn_nyt>you would even save out a comment ;)
(10:09:42)<ido>that depends where that vart is
(10:10:01)<ido>i owuld call it "level"
(10:10:11)<purestrain>me to
(10:10:17)<konijn_nyt>level would hold the level no ?
(10:10:19)<purestrain>currentDungeonLevelWhereThePlayerIsIn
(10:10:22)<konijn_nyt>with all walls/doors/monsters
(10:10:35)<konijn_nyt>heh
(10:11:45)<konijn_nyt>yeah
(10:11:55)<konijn_nyt>Level is an ambigous word I guess
(10:12:08)<konijn_nyt>maybe currentDungeonDepth ;)
(10:12:56)<ido>why "current"
(10:13:12)<ido>"DungeonLevel", if you are so inclined 
(10:13:46)<konijn_nyt>ah
(10:13:55)<konijn_nyt>mayhaps I got blindsided by the comment
(10:14:06)<konijn_nyt>as we say at nyt, it is what it is ;)
(10:14:47)<ido>konijn_nyt: you may be a c programmer, but you have the heart of a cobol coder 
(10:18:12)<konijn_nyt>I am next gen COBOL coder
(10:18:15)<konijn_nyt>oh my god
(10:18:25)<konijn_nyt>are you saying it is bleeding into my other code ??
(10:18:29)<konijn_nyt>that is terrible
(10:18:50)<konijn_nyt>I do ABAP
(10:19:43)<ido>never had anything to do with ABAP
(10:19:47)<ido>had to google it
(10:19:52)<konijn_nyt>hehehe
(10:20:05)<konijn_nyt>the only thing good about it is that it guarantees good income for developers ;)
(10:20:29)<ido>like java then ;)
(10:20:52)<ido>at my last job i made maybe 50% more than the php programmers 
(10:21:02)<ido>only because i was doing java and they were doing php
(10:21:24)<ido>ok, maybe 30%
(10:21:39)<ido>but a lot mreo, at any rate
(10:22:08)<ido>(jesus christ that is some hardcore dyslexia)
(10:22:25)<ido>other than the 'm' not a single letter is where it should be
(10:23:07)<konijn_nyt>well, ABAP in general gets you 100% once you start to have like 5 years of exp
(10:23:14)<konijn_nyt>100% more that is
(10:23:21)<ido>:O
(10:23:23)<konijn_nyt>yeah
(10:23:25)<ido>than what?
(10:23:29)<konijn_nyt>than php
(10:23:44)<konijn_nyt>PHP employee would be about 70K
(10:23:45)<ido>yea php pays the worst 
(10:23:51)<konijn_nyt>ABAP would be about 140K
(10:24:18)<ido>well these are ny/cali rates 
(10:24:24)<konijn_nyt>indeed
(10:24:28)<konijn_nyt>I guess
(10:24:34)<konijn_nyt>although there is a limited amount of ABAPers
(10:25:05)<ido>in israel a nice java or c++ job would net you maybe 80k usd
(10:25:05)<konijn_nyt>I have friends in that state with horse carts and the black clothes
(10:25:17)<ido>if you have ~3 years expereince 
(10:25:23)<konijn_nyt>ah
(10:25:32)<konijn_nyt>hmmm
(10:25:35)<konijn_nyt>I would have given you more
(10:25:50)<ido>me personally?
(10:25:58)<konijn_nyt>ys
(10:26:18)<ido> 80k usd goes a long way in tel aviv 
(10:26:27)<ido>it is cheaper than nyc
(10:26:39)<konijn_nyt>yeah , prices are insane here
(10:26:53)<konijn_nyt>I pay like 4200 usd montly rent
(10:27:00)<ido>:O
(10:27:02)<konijn_nyt>of course, I have 3 children and a nanny
(10:27:06)<ido>how big is your place?
(10:27:15)<konijn_nyt>it's a 2 family home just for us
(10:27:28)<ido>inside the city?
(10:27:33)<konijn_nyt>no no
(10:27:37)<konijn_nyt>westchester
(10:27:48)<konijn_nyt>about manhattan is the bronx, above the bronx is westchester
(10:27:56)<konijn_nyt>*above manhattan
(10:28:06)<konijn_nyt>30 minutes train ride to times square
(10:28:13)<ido>not too bad
(10:28:27)<ido>i would call 30 mins "in nyc"
(10:28:39)<konijn_nyt>okay ;)
(10:28:42)<ido>or at least "in greater nyc"
(10:28:43)<konijn_nyt>nyc is realy small though
(10:29:17)<konijn_nyt>http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=40.961414,-73.729317&spn=0.001199,0.00294&t=h&z=19
(10:29:33)<konijn_nyt>the center wood street label, the house left of it, with the black roof
(10:29:34)<ido>ah
(10:29:42)<ido>that looks very suburban 
(10:29:45)<konijn_nyt>indeed
(10:29:50)<konijn_nyt>you cant really say that is nyc
(10:30:00)<ido>i thought it would be more urban 
(10:30:09)<konijn_nyt>noops
(10:30:31)<konijn_nyt>my previous house costed to much, but was way cooler
(10:31:16)<konijn_nyt>http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=80+Garden+Rd,+Scarsdale,+NY+10583&sll=40.961414,-73.729317&sspn=0.61393,1.505127&ie=UTF8&ll=41.006527,-73.773864&spn=0.000599,0.00147&t=h&z=20&iwloc=addr
(10:31:41)<konijn_nyt>this was also 30 minutes train ride to nyc
(10:32:35)<ido>looks like the setting of a zombie film 
(10:32:49)<ido>with all those dead trees around 
(10:36:09)<konijn_nyt>heheh
(10:36:38)<konijn_nyt>that's why autumn and snowless winter is so depressing here
(10:37:07)<ido>nyc's population density is only slightly more than tel aviv's 
(10:37:20)<RotateMe_witDog>konijn_nyt: where do you know ABAP from?
(10:37:21)<ido>10k/sq. km vs 7k
(10:37:39)<ido>but it is much bigger
(10:37:47)<konijn_nyt>Got course on my first job with Procter & Gamble in Brussels
(10:37:56)<ido>i figured the difference would be bigger
(10:38:00)<konijn_nyt>got 70% pay increase after I changed
(10:38:19)<RotateMe>k, i'm currently doing a work while study thing for the company which developed ABAP
(10:38:30)<ido>sap?
(10:38:30)<konijn_nyt>SAP ?
(10:39:05)<ido>(beat you by milliseconds) 
(10:39:16)<konijn_nyt>no on my screen ;)
(10:39:22)<ido>:O
(10:39:28)<ido>huh
(10:39:33)<RotateMe>ys
(10:39:36)<konijn_nyt>hmmm
(10:39:41)<konijn_nyt>which SAP office ?
(10:39:49)<RotateMe>Walldorf in germany
(10:39:50)<ido>i guess irc doesn't allow that kind of granuality 
(10:39:51)<RotateMe>the hq
(10:40:06)<konijn_nyt>wow
(10:40:08)<konijn_nyt>that is cool
(10:40:19)<konijn_nyt>so what's the study about ?
(10:40:24)<RotateMe>yeah it's nice to have income during your study but i will be switching though
(10:40:26)<konijn_nyt>how to kill ABAP with java ;)
(10:40:49)<RotateMe>no i think i chose the wrong words
(10:41:08)<RotateMe>not a study but i'm studying 3 month and working 3 months for 3 years
(10:41:22)<RotateMe>and after that the company may employ you in most cases
(10:42:01)<RotateMe>problem is 8 of 11 subjects in the university are economic subjects
(10:42:13)<RotateMe>only 2 are vaguely about IT
(10:42:25)<konijn_nyt>np for SAP I think
(10:42:30)<RotateMe>not my cup of tea so i'm thinking about doing something else
(10:42:31)<ido>what is your course of study 
(10:42:54)<RotateMe>business economics with information technology
(10:43:08)<ido>sounds boring 
(10:43:13)<RotateMe>yup
(10:43:34)<RotateMe>i guess i'll go for math with information technology :D
(10:44:53)<ido>actually it sounds more bourgeois than boring 
(10:46:37)<RotateMe>business economics?
(10:47:25)<ido>yes
(10:47:30)<ido>heh: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/TelAviv-paam4.jpg

(07:18:48)<ido>ask RotateMe

(07:20:02)<RotateMe>i knew i made too few comments ;)
(07:22:07)<ido>Santiago de Chile looks nice
(07:22:30)<ido>the quesetion is, can you find a job as a programmer there
(07:22:53)<konijn_nyt>sure I can
(07:23:09)<konijn_nyt>I would make less money of course
(07:23:12)<konijn_nyt>but hey
(07:23:21)<konijn_nyt>the weather would be better than here !
(07:25:19)<ido>huh
(07:25:19)<ido>not bad
(07:25:20)<konijn_nyt>indeed
(07:25:21)<konijn_nyt>architect-developer , but still
(07:25:37)<konijn_nyt>I would work for multi-national like I have done before
(07:25:43)<konijn_nyt>same sh*t, different country ;)
(07:26:03)<ido>have you worked there already?
(07:27:29)<konijn_nyt>noops
(07:27:38)<konijn_nyt>I worked in Belgium, Canada and US
(07:28:04)<konijn_nyt>but as I understand from my traveling collegues, it really is no different in South American capitals
(07:28:42)<ido>i've known some south americans here in europe
(07:28:53)<ido>mostly women in their 20's-30's
(07:28:59)<konijn_nyt>;)
(07:29:11)<ido>from what i;ve heard a lot fo the big cities over there are quite dangerous 
(07:29:19)<konijn_nyt>you have to be carefull
(07:29:37)<konijn_nyt>it's not as if nyc is heaven either
(07:29:47)<konijn_nyt>or tel aviv I imagine
(07:29:59)<ido>yes, well that depends 
(07:30:44)<ido>the problems in israel in that respect are from terrorism, not crime 
(07:31:17)<ido>and that tends to focus in the colonies and to a lesser jerusalem 
(07:31:50)<konijn_nyt>which reminds me
(07:32:01)<ido>in the past decade there have been very few terrorist activities in TA
(07:32:40)<konijn_nyt>Another potential location would also be Jordany
(07:32:49)<ido>jordan?
(07:32:52)<konijn_nyt>yes
(07:32:56)<konijn_nyt>my wife works with the UN
(07:33:00)<konijn_nyt>so I follow her
(07:33:06)<konijn_nyt>there is a big UNRA basis in Jordany
(07:33:19)<konijn_nyt>with schools/hospitals/etc for Palestinian refugees
(07:33:24)<ido>i don't think there is much of a  software industry over there 
(07:33:28)<konijn_nyt>indeed
(07:33:37)<konijn_nyt>oh well
(07:33:46)<konijn_nyt>maybe I would have to get into offshore model
(07:33:50)<konijn_nyt>compete with the Indians ;)
(07:33:58)<ido>you could commute to israel ;)
(07:34:06)<konijn_nyt>heheh
(07:34:18)<ido>the border is open since '94
(07:34:23)<ido>so it is allowed 
(07:34:27)<konijn_nyt>as I understand Jordan does not accept passports with Israel stamps
(07:34:34)<konijn_nyt>I could go , but not come back
(07:34:36)<ido>that not true
(07:34:41)<konijn_nyt>you sure ??
(07:34:45)<ido>you are thinking of Syria maybe
(07:34:51)<konijn_nyt>maybe
(07:34:53)<konijn_nyt>gtg
(07:35:44)<RotateMe>i'll be going too, bye!
(07:35:57)<ido>i should go to bed as well
(08:45:52)<konijn_wife>anybody still reading here ?
(08:45:55)<konijn_wife>I guess not
(08:45:59)<konijn_wife>I will play a bit with the bot

(09:18:45)<konijn_nyt>my apologies if you hate clutter
(09:51:53)<jomiolto>hmm, my 7drl is starting to look like a roguelike: http://www.hytti.uku.fi/~jmtoivan/apj.png :)
(09:54:11)<konijn_nyt>indeed it is
(09:54:51)<jomiolto>now it just has to feel like one too :)
(09:55:30)<konijn_nyt>As long as you have life, it will feel like it 
(09:55:34)<konijn_nyt>and not too silly controls
(09:56:29)<jomiolto>well, the idea is quite different from most other roguelikes
(09:56:51)<konijn_nyt>hmmm
(09:56:52)<jomiolto>at least according to my current plans there will be no actual fighting with monsters at all
(09:56:57)<konijn_nyt>ah
(09:57:00)<konijn_nyt>combat less 
(09:57:08)<konijn_nyt>i see you skipped on los ;)
(09:57:29)<jomiolto>not really, the los just isn't highlighted and I have explored almost the whole level in the screenie
(09:57:55)<jomiolto>the game does have a regular ray-casting with bresenhams' algorithms LOS
(09:58:51)<konijn_nyt>ah
(09:58:59)<konijn_nyt>okay
(09:59:09)<jomiolto>hmm, and I don't quite like the dungeon generation, but hopefully I'll have time to tweak it later
(09:59:13)<konijn_nyt>so you remember monster positions ?
(09:59:20)<konijn_nyt>or T and t are not monsters ?
(09:59:30)<jomiolto>nope, there aren't any monsters in the screenie :) they're all "items"
(09:59:41)<konijn_nyt>good enough

(10:02:39)<jomiolto>heh, I first thought of reusing an old dungeon generator I had written for another roguelike project, but the code was so awful and messy that it was easier to rewrite the whole thing according to the same general idea
(10:03:24)<konijn_nyt>its funny how we keep getting better at refactoring
(10:03:34)<konijn_nyt>I wonder how my code will look when I'm 60

(11:03:59)<Aerton>perhaps, SDL includes some system .h where it's defined
(11:04:23)<jomiolto>oh, right, "man connect" displays documentation of the function
(11:04:58)<Aerton>just rename yours
(11:05:09)<TMC>or make it static
(11:05:20)<Aerton>that would work too
(11:05:20)<jomiolto>hmm
(11:05:24)<TMC>(dungeon connection I assume?)
(11:05:33)<Aerton>if you only need it on one file
(11:05:44)<Aerton>but then it should be static anyway
(11:05:52)<jomiolto>renaming it words, but I still don't quite get why SDL ended up calling my "connect" function?
(11:06:21)<TMC>incidently, can the compiler do any extra optimisations on static fucntions?
(11:06:28)<jomiolto>and if function connect is already defined, then why didn't gcc warn me about it
(11:06:48)<TMC>hmm, maybe not, you could still possibly need a function pointer to a static function
(11:06:59)<Aerton>because compiler can't know about it
(11:07:11)<Aerton>the mess only occurs when you run the program
(11:07:36)<Aerton>compiler *may* optimise static functions
(11:07:46)<jomiolto>actually, now that I think of it, my gcc has been behaving oddly for sometime already
(11:08:01)<jomiolto>for some reason it often fails to warn me about functions having a wrong number of parameters
(11:08:02)<Aerton>no, that's normal behaviour
(11:08:11)<Aerton>do you use -Wall ?
(11:08:14)<jomiolto>yeah
(11:08:23)<Aerton>try -Wextra
(11:08:34)<Aerton>in addition
(11:09:01)<Aerton>-Wshadow is also nice
(11:09:07)<TMC>-Wshadow?
(11:09:30)<Aerton>warns if you overshadow a global variable name with a local one
(11:09:41)<TMC>ah
(11:11:29)<jomiolto>blah, it still lets me call a function with any number of parameters, no matter what the prototype of the function looks like
(11:11:32)<jomiolto>weird
(11:11:44)<Aerton>that's C, not C++ ?
(11:11:50)<jomiolto>yeah, plain C
(11:12:16)<Aerton>in C function names don't include info about parameters
(11:13:17)<jomiolto>yeah, but prototypes do
(11:13:31)<jomiolto>or whatever they're called
(11:13:45)<jomiolto>the "int function(blah blah);" things you put in .h files
(11:14:07)<Aerton>so what? that's runtime, not a compilation issue
(11:14:38)<jomiolto>gcc warns me about missing prototypes, but does nothing when the prototype exists, but the function is called with wrong number/type of parameters
(11:15:05)<Aerton>do you listen to me?
(11:15:08)<jomiolto>yes
(11:15:33)<Aerton>gcc can not complain about that issue
(11:15:46)<Aerton>SDL uses system header with system connect
(11:15:55)<Aerton>your code uses your header with our's
(11:16:07)<TMC>"ours"?
(11:16:10)<TMC>are you a SDL dev?
(11:16:21)<jomiolto>oh, I wasn't talking about that issue anymore
(11:16:21)<Aerton>duh, missed y :)
(11:16:30)<jomiolto>this happens with my own functions too
(11:16:47)<Aerton>since, they are compiled separately, the issue never occurs to gcc
(11:17:23)<Aerton>but in runtime, when you binary runs, it loads SDL
(11:17:34)<Aerton>SDL needs a functon named connect
(11:17:43)<Aerton>and your binary have it exported
(11:17:56)<Aerton>the glibc has connect too
(11:18:04)<Aerton>but your connect takes a priority
(11:18:26)<jomiolto>well, I renamed the function already and this weirdness still happens, even when I compile without SDL
(11:18:47)<Aerton>hm?
(11:19:03)<Aerton>what's a problem than?
(11:19:14)<jomiolto>if I have a function "int foo();", gcc lets me call it with *any* number of parameters
(11:19:34)<Aerton>that's correct
(11:19:41)<jomiolto>no matter what the prototype says, I can feed anything to the functions
(11:19:53)<Aerton>in C, int foo() is the same as int foo(...)
(11:20:02)<jomiolto>hmm?
(11:20:03)<Aerton>use int foo (void)
(11:20:13)<TMC>oo
(11:20:17)<TMC>I didn't know that
(11:20:29)<jomiolto>not in recent C, at least to my knowledge
(11:20:33)<Aerton>it's different from C++, where int foo() is the same as int foo(void)
(11:21:08)<TMC>reinforcing that C !subsetof C++
(11:21:53)<jomiolto>well, it happens with functions that have parameters too
(11:22:49)<jomiolto>for example, I have a "long dice(const char *str);" function and gcc lets me call it with any parameters I want
(11:23:19)<jomiolto>I can do "dice(10, "hello world!", 1.30F);" and gcc compiles it happily, but then it crashes when I run it
(11:23:21)<TMC>why don't you use dice(int,int) :(
(11:24:19)<jomiolto>I have a separate version with long parameters, called ldice :)
(11:24:48)<Aerton>try -Wmissing-prototypes
(11:24:56)<TMC>you've lost me
(11:24:59)<Aerton>sounds you don't have prototype visible where it's used
(11:25:16)<TMC>aren't long's 32bit on 32 bit machines?
(11:25:26)<TMC>(or am I confused with FB?)
(11:25:34)<Aerton>it is
(11:26:27)<jomiolto>long is anything with 32bits or more
(11:26:36)<TMC>well are you planning to compile your code on 16bit machines?
(11:26:48)<jomiolto>well, who knows :)
(11:27:26)<jomiolto>hmm, now I'm getting warnings again, weird :(
(11:27:57)<jomiolto>um, make that errors, of course
(11:28:27)<jomiolto>sometimes I get warnings of bad number of arguments, sometimes not
(11:29:49)<jomiolto>ah, it was a problem with makefiles
(11:30:17)<jomiolto>I had "-Wall" missing from some places
(11:31:02)<jomiolto>hmm, no that's not it either :(
(11:31:12)<jomiolto>I think I'm going insane, that must be it...
(11:35:34)<jomiolto>well, now everything seems to be okay, but I don't understand how I managed to compile bad code earlier

(02:01:21)<Aerton>standard is 80x24
(02:02:31)<Numeron>heh, yeah that one... is there a standard size larger though?

(06:11:54)<Aerton>no wonder spear is useless against colt or uzi

(06:12:48)<joe6pack>they actually did that in fallout 2,
(06:12:55)<joe6pack>but only at the veru beginning 
(06:13:45)<joe6pack>another problem is that in both games after a  certain point money ceases to make any difference 
(06:13:57)<joe6pack>you just start having way more than you can ever spend 
(06:14:47)<joe6pack>(these are all minor issues, btw - both games are superb) 
(06:16:48)<purestrain>i own both but never had time to play them though
(06:17:06)<joe6pack>:O
(06:17:24)<joe6pack>german version or original? 
(06:17:31)<purestrain>german i think
(06:17:47)<joe6pack>the german translation is especially horrendes 
(06:17:55)<joe6pack>you should download the english version
(06:18:13)<joe6pack>it makes a big difference 
(06:18:26)<joe6pack>the translators must have been on crack
(06:19:04)<joe6pack>these are some of the gratest games i have ever played 
(06:20:21)<Aerton>try wasteland, some ppl say it's better balanced
(06:20:34)<joe6pack>huh
(06:20:44)<Aerton>graphics are terrible, but should not be much of problem for an rl addict
(06:20:46)<joe6pack>should give it a try some time 
(06:21:00)<joe6pack>yea i think i've played it for a few minutes once
(06:25:39)<RotateMe>searching for wasteland made me stumble upon this
(06:25:39)<RotateMe>http://www.bastionsofwar.com/maps.html
(06:25:49)<RotateMe>which made me want to play neverwinter nights again
(06:31:23)<deveah>gmornin
(06:31:29)<joe6pack>hi
(06:31:45)<joe6pack>DarkGod: what are you up to these days?
(06:33:13)<deveah>":p" - ascii logo and text editor
(06:33:26)<deveah>mainly for roguelike start screen
(06:33:39)<DarkGod>preparing my wedding :)
(06:33:44)<joe6pack>:O
(06:33:49)<joe6pack>congrats 
(06:33:59)<deveah>wedding =o
(06:34:04)<DarkGod>thanks :)
(06:34:29)<deveah>no roguelike design after i see
(06:42:10)<RotateMe>congrats!
(06:43:40)<joe6pack>do you incorporate changes from V into tome?
(06:44:18)<joe6pack>seeing as development on v had been picking up pace once more
(06:45:21)<DarkGod>T3 is not really a variant of vanilla anymore I cant port changes just like that
(06:45:24)<DarkGod>anyawy what changes?
(06:45:54)<joe6pack>i don't know, i have been playing neither angband nor tome for years 
(06:46:06)<joe6pack>was just wondering if there is some cooperation going on
(06:47:19)<joe6pack>they are both just too slow paced for me (no offense) 
(06:48:30)<DarkGod>?
(06:49:04)<joe6pack>i am not sure what you're asking :)
(06:49:07)<TMC>the gameplay, or development?
(06:49:15)<joe6pack>TMC: gameplay 
(06:51:13)<DarkGod>why does it feels slow?
(06:51:16)<DarkGod>compared to what?
(06:51:39)<joe6pack>compared to crawl
(06:52:12)<joe6pack>and to a lot of minor games
(06:52:30)<RotateMe>can anybody tell me how to move diagonally in cracks and crevices win?
(06:52:40)<joe6pack>(like doomrl, which i know is not a fair comparison)
(06:53:01)<joe6pack>RotateMe: you have to change the default key binding 
(06:53:13)<joe6pack>read the readme file
(06:53:19)<joe6pack>it's easy
(06:53:36)<joe6pack>you just need to copy some file that's there or cahnge its name or something of that sort
(06:53:37)<Glowie>I don't know about Angband's speed, but it's the grinding that doesn't suit me personally
(06:53:48)<Glowie>I don't like being able to camp the floors as many times as I want
(06:53:52)<joe6pack>i don't know why stu did it this way
(06:54:41)<TMC>yeah, silly :P
(06:55:03)<joe6pack>Glowie: yes, i find that tome, albit better in that respect than angband, suffers from this same problem
(07:02:12)<Glowie>Uhm, does anyone know where to find Mac's platform dependent functions documented?
(07:02:40)<joe6pack>though i've only ever played the 2.x branch. i don't know if you've changed that in 3
(07:10:29)<deveah>i want a roguelike. 7drl is preferred
(07:10:43)<deveah>ascii please
(07:11:27)<joe6pack>did you try that last one?
(07:11:31)<joe6pack>with the mage?
(07:11:36)<joe6pack>that was fun
(07:11:37)<deveah>no, what one?
(07:11:45)<joe6pack>don't remember the name
(07:12:04)<joe6pack>with the small screen size
(07:12:08)<joe6pack>and the shops
(07:12:10)<Numeron>crown of the forest
(07:12:14)<joe6pack>yes
(07:12:15)<Numeron>mine :)
(07:12:16)<deveah>oh, crown'o'dah'forest
(07:12:26)<deveah>nah, else?
(07:12:57)<joe6pack>don't know. that was the only recent 7drl i've enjoyed playing 
(07:12:59)<deveah>*random page on rlbasin*
(07:13:10)<joe6pack>(otehr than mine, that is ;p )
(07:14:19)<Numeron>im started a larger scale project a couple of days ago using the same idea as in crown... calling in wizard arena
(07:14:49)<joe6pack>nice
(07:15:09)<joe6pack>i am edging to do a larger scale game myself
(07:15:22)<joe6pack>but i have to focus on my studies atm
(07:15:34)<joe6pack>can't afford such a distraction right now
(07:18:18)<deveah>i'm gonna make a rogue-style room generator
(07:19:08)<TMC>using the link of the day? :P
(07:19:12)<deveah>nah, too lazy
(07:19:24)<deveah>i was thinking of reading it
(07:19:52)<TMC>"calling in wizard arena"?
(07:19:55)<joe6pack>too lazy to read half a page of text, but not too lazy to implement what it describes?
(07:19:58)<TMC>is that the name of the game?
(07:20:09)<TMC>BTW, I beat crown yesterday
(07:20:13)<TMC>very nice :)
(07:20:37)<Numeron>yeah spelling mistake.. in = it
(07:20:40)<Numeron>thanks
(07:20:51)<TMC>oh
(07:21:02)<TMC>you have to steal something?
(07:21:10)<TMC>I really like the idea
(07:21:25)<TMC>or having possession for the longest?
(07:22:14)<joe6pack>ah. i should "borrow" the stealing idea for my next game ;)
(07:22:59)<Numeron>i plan to have a few different arenas in my game... one which is a free for all posession, a team play one too... 
(07:23:20)<Numeron>other arenas which are jsut survival etc
(07:29:35)<TMC>all without perma death?
(07:30:19)<TMC>I like the idea of stealing an important artifact without killing in regular rl's too
(07:31:08)<TMC>they need ways to shove someone down stairs and make them drop their weapon, or everything to fall out of their backpack, for example
(07:31:11)<joe6pack>heh. Massachusetts seems to have the biggest cryptrover players community in the world ;)
(07:31:19)<Numeron>no permadeath in the arenas, but permadeath in the world (which you ahve to explore for reasons I havent thought up yet)
(07:31:31)<joe6pack>google analytics is so cool 
(07:32:07)<joe6pack>and non of them from boston!
(07:32:14)<joe6pack>all from small towns 
(07:32:52)<TMC>hmm
(07:32:57)<TMC>how many of them?
(07:34:06)<joe6pack>146 world wide; 42 from the us; 5 from Massachusetts 
(07:34:21)<joe6pack>pretty spread out all over the world, actually 
(07:34:47)<joe6pack>no single concentration in any city or province 
(07:36:02)<joe6pack>wrt single cities
(07:36:21)<joe6pack>the top are Bucharest and Warsaw
(07:36:29)<TMC>I didn't know it could get you locations that specific
(07:36:31)<joe6pack>both with 3 visitors 
(07:36:45)<TMC>g'night
(07:36:50)<joe6pack>good night
(07:37:18)<RotateMe>Numeron, i'm planning to do an arena rl too, but only 7drl
(07:37:20)<RotateMe>http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/RogueArena%20Design.txt
(07:37:34)<RotateMe>wrote this at work instead of working ;)
(07:39:07)<RotateMe>hmm the formatting seems to be messed up, i copy pasted it via a wts connection
(07:41:06)<Numeron>looks very cool. I think its a fair bit different from what i have planned :)
(07:42:18)<Numeron>i like this idea: "sudden death:
(07:42:18)<Numeron>the arena get's flooded: water flows from one point into the arena. characters in the water loose some hp per
(07:43:01)<purestrain>well; but realtime and very fast?
(07:43:45)<purestrain>don't have roguelikes to be played without sweating? ;-)
(07:44:48)<xGrue>well what if you just finished jogging?
(07:45:06)<purestrain>usually i take a shower
(07:45:09)<RotateMe>that was my thoughts to xGrue ;D
(07:45:40)<purestrain>make time variable at least
(07:45:50)<RotateMe>yeah but "very fast" goes a bit too far i guess
(07:46:26)<RotateMe>i think i'm going to release a very small demo of dungeonhunter
(07:46:30)<Numeron>you could make it so you only have x seconds to make your turn or its considered a wait.. that makes it easy to add difficulty levels
(07:46:33)<RotateMe>my bug list is too empty
(07:46:52)<RotateMe>Numeron, the system works in a different way
(07:47:19)<RotateMe>each action takes some time and after you did the action you have to wait that number of frames
(07:47:42)<RotateMe>after that you are considered "ready" and keypresses/ai input will be accepted
(07:48:09)<RotateMe>this way the game speed doesn't vary
(07:48:46)<xGrue>this gonna be a 7drl or a real project?
(07:49:06)<RotateMe>dungeonhunter = real, roguearena 7drl
(07:49:28)<RotateMe>it's a bit stuffed, i know
(07:49:51)<xGrue>meh i have plans for a 7drl thats gonna be fairly tough to pull off in 7 days
(07:50:18)<RotateMe>i will try to learn to use jice's doryen library effectively, add some stuff here and there
(07:50:34)<RotateMe>but i want to do the rl related stuff in the 7 days
(07:50:50)<RotateMe>so no fov, dungeon generation or anything before that
(07:51:17)<xGrue>have any ideas of what youre gonna use?
(07:51:26)<xGrue>or will it be brainstormed up during the 7 days?
(07:52:53)<deveah>i want YOU"RE A PIRATE NOW!!!
(07:53:26)<xGrue>whats that?
(07:53:54)<RotateMe>like i said, i'm using jice's doryen library with c++
(07:54:04)<xGrue>never heard of it :P
(07:54:34)<purestrain>wah; c++ ugly :P
(07:55:02)<RotateMe>http://jice.nospam.googlepages.com/thedoryenlibrary
(07:55:13)<RotateMe>yeah or c, i don't know
(07:55:21)<RotateMe>there's a version for both
(07:56:07)<RotateMe>oh i just see that this already has fov support
(08:09:32)<RotateMe>joe6pack, have you been at the viennale?

(08:29:24)<joe6pack>i try to go every year 
(08:31:42)<joe6pack>i don't think i would like a real time rl
(08:31:59)<joe6pack>i like leaving the game open in the middle and going to do other things
(08:32:06)<joe6pack>like chat :)
(08:32:40)<joe6pack>and then coming back, play for a few turns, read something on the web, etc..
(08:32:55)<joe6pack>it is rarely the *only* thing i do at any given time

(08:41:53)<konijn_bed>'bestial side' -> There should be fear of fire
(08:42:20)<RotateMe>joe6pack, what and whom did you see?
(08:42:39)<RotateMe>my sister studies in vienna and she just told me she watched no country for old men there
(08:42:47)<joe6pack>ah
(08:42:50)<konijn_nyt>roll 5d6
(08:42:50)<null>12
(08:42:57)<joe6pack>i've wanted to watch that one
(08:42:59)<RotateMe>roll 1d0
(08:42:59)<null>1
(08:43:01)<joe6pack>but iwas too late
(08:43:02)<RotateMe>buuuug
(08:43:07)<konijn_nyt>yeah
(08:43:08)<joe6pack>was already sold out
(08:43:10)<konijn_nyt>bug is fixed
(08:43:12)<RotateMe>ah too bad
(08:43:14)<konijn_nyt>need to restart
(08:43:20)<RotateMe>k
(08:43:26)<RotateMe>and why doesn't that work:
(08:43:31)<RotateMe>roll 473d34
(08:43:37)<RotateMe>roll 473d3
(08:43:41)<RotateMe>roll 47d34

(08:44:13)<konijn_nyt>it does up to 2 numbers on dicecount, up to 3 for dicesides
(08:44:30)<RotateMe>okay
(08:44:41)<RotateMe>is this actual code?
(08:44:43)<konijn_nyt>should be useful in most rl situations
(08:44:46)<konijn_nyt>yes
(08:44:56)<RotateMe>yeah it's enough just wondered why
(08:45:07)<konijn_nyt>lets see if I get kicked ;)
(08:45:09)<RotateMe>i would have done it totally different
(08:45:14)<konijn_nyt>		} else if (message.startsWith("roll") ) {

(08:46:15)<joe6pack>konijn_nyt: why only 2 chars for the number? why not use '+'?
(08:46:20)<RotateMe>the "bug" is a philosphical problem
(08:46:42)<joe6pack>RotateMe: no it isn't. a D0 dice only has the value 0 
(08:46:52)<joe6pack>D1, on the other hand...
(08:47:32)<RotateMe>well there are no events with 0 possible outcomes
(08:47:56)<joe6pack>yes there are
(08:48:32)<joe6pack>(e.g. casting a D0 dice)
(08:48:40)<Numeron>a die with no sides can have no values.. 0 is a value
(08:49:07)<RotateMe>well that again is just a definition
(08:49:15)<joe6pack>so the answer should be NAN?
(08:49:20)<RotateMe>for the only possible outcome
(08:49:37)<RotateMe>you can see the problem that he had to treat this case differently
(08:51:18)<RotateMe>joe6pack, no i think Numeron is right, most people would define the result of a d0 as 0 and furthermore it's possible to have weapons in rl's that treat d0 damage
(08:51:38)<joe6pack>ok
(08:51:54)<Numeron>why would you want a weapon that deals d0 damage?
(08:52:07)<RotateMe>dammit i have unconnected sections in the dungeons i generate :(
(08:52:11)<xGrue>java!!
(08:52:16)<RotateMe>d0 + x
(08:52:17)<joe6pack>now *that* is a philosophical question 
(08:52:35)<Numeron>ah
(08:52:39)<joe6pack>RotateMe: in other words 'x'
(08:53:03)<xGrue>what about 100d0 + x
(08:53:06)<RotateMe>ys
(08:53:10)<joe6pack>x
(08:53:16)<xGrue>10000000d0 + x?
(08:53:18)<joe6pack>still x
(08:53:21)<RotateMe>lol :D
(08:53:26)<joe6pack>0*... = 0
(08:53:43)<xGrue>0*1/0   != 0
(08:53:51)<joe6pack>1/0 is not defined 
(08:54:04)<xGrue>which isnt zero
(08:54:23)<joe6pack>"not equal" != "not defined" 
(08:54:25)<Numeron>its remainder 1 ;)
(08:54:37)<RotateMe>btw, is the random seed somehow initialized
(08:54:44)<RotateMe>with the current time or s.th.?
(08:54:50)<xGrue>whats "not defined" in code?
(08:54:52)<xGrue>error?
(08:54:59)<joe6pack>i guess
(08:55:00)<Numeron>null?
(08:55:07)<RotateMe>""
(08:55:13)<joe6pack>it is like writing "x=yo!;" in c
(08:55:26)<xGrue>lol
(08:55:29)<joe6pack>it is somply not allowed 
(08:55:41)<RotateMe>yo!
(08:55:56)<joe6pack>int x=yo!;
(08:58:21)<RotateMe>any ideas on how to connect unconnected dungeon sections when the only information are the value 1=wall 0=nothing for each tile?
(08:58:36)<RotateMe>(so no extra stuff like an array with the rooms etc.)
(08:58:58)<joe6pack>draw a line of 0's between them?
(08:59:23)<RotateMe>well how do i know what are the sections?
(08:59:36)<joe6pack>do it during the dungeon digging, not afterwards
(08:59:47)<RotateMe>take pairs of points and try pathfinding?
(08:59:48)<joe6pack>every time you dig a room you have it's center 
(09:00:01)<joe6pack>that seems like a slow way of doing it
(09:00:59)<joe6pack>just make sure you rooms are connected to one another while you create them, don't go digging rooms willy nilly and then try to find unconnected ones 
(09:02:06)<Numeron>im not a big fan on dungeon levels where every room except 2 have 2 exits only
(09:02:37)<joe6pack>who says they only have to have 2 exits?
(09:03:22)<Numeron>if you arent storing the rooms as you create them, then arent you drilling a corridor, make a room, drill corridor make room etc? you cant go back to rooms and make more corridors
(09:03:28)<joe6pack>look at the way i did it here: http://code.google.com/p/cryptrover/source/browse/trunk/map.c
(09:03:40)<joe6pack>in dig_level()
(09:04:00)<joe6pack>i dig more than 1 corrdor every time 
(09:04:19)<joe6pack>i dig a random amount of corridors for from each room
(09:04:51)<Numeron>ah i see
(09:05:09)<joe6pack>                        int paths=1+rand()%PATHS;
(09:07:52)<konijn_nyt>google code rocks
(09:08:00)<konijn_nyt>I _love_ the new svn browse thing
(09:08:15)<xGrue>yeah i need to start using that
(09:08:15)<joe6pack>yea it's rockin'
(09:08:54)<joe6pack>i suggest you setup a page for the bot there
(09:10:11)<joe6pack>http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/2/14/203728/938
(09:10:15)<konijn_nyt>I will !
(09:10:31)<konijn_nyt>brunch any minute now
(09:10:39)<konijn_nyt>that'll take a while ;)
(09:10:46)<konijn_nyt>then I set up a google code project
(09:10:49)<joe6pack>time
(09:10:49)<null>joe6pack: The time is now Sun Feb 17 09:10:49 EST 2008
(09:10:58)<joe6pack>brunch do early?
(09:11:10)<joe6pack>that's not even time for breakfast yet
(09:11:16)<konijn_nyt>we still need to get to the brunch place by car
(09:11:23)<joe6pack>oh
(09:11:29)<joe6pack>i thought you're having it at home 
(09:11:32)<konijn_nyt>and when you have kids, these schedules tend to change ;)
(09:13:50)<joe6pack>"A young woman named Esther Howland immigrated to the United States, dismayed at not having received a single Valentine during her 20 years in England. She established a small card company in Massachusetts, with cards tailored to both men and women. American consumers were thrilled at the possibility of marginalizing relationships to hollow slogans and meaningless gifts in exchange for greater copulation."
(09:17:10)<Numeron>i didnt give my gf a card on valentines.. i bought her a bunch of roses though :) then we sneaked a bottle of vodka into the movies
(09:17:18)<Numeron>good times
(09:17:57)<xGrue>vodka!
(09:18:32)<Numeron>what better way to celebrate a relationship than get totally trashed in the middle of the day in public
(09:18:51)<joe6pack>none whatsoever 
(09:18:58)<deveah>i hate valentines day
(09:19:06)<deveah>i hate it's celebrated in Romania
(09:19:38)<joe6pack>if i didn't have an internet connection i wouldn't have even known it's now
(09:19:50)<Numeron>how come u hate it?
(09:19:55)<joe6pack>it isn't really that visible over here 
(09:20:13)<konijn_nyt>I went to  a Belgian place and have a beer wit Ms konijn
(09:21:17)<deveah>NUmeron: i hate it because it's not Romanian - and those who brought non-romanian holidays here want Romania to split
(09:21:42)<deveah>like the filthy hungarians : they want Covasna and Harghita, together with all our resources
(09:21:46)<joe6pack>burn the evil foreigners! 
(09:22:23)<joe6pack>deveah: it is actually your precious bodily fluids they are after 
(09:22:31)<deveah>and in the 1700-1800's the hungarians took romanian people, mainly kids and pregnant women into barns which they burnt
(09:22:54)<konijn_nyt>ew
(09:23:05)<joe6pack>9/11/1701 NEVER FORGET 
(09:23:25)<Numeron>valenties day isnt hungarian either though...
(09:23:41)<deveah>yes, it's true - and because they have power - they made romanian people learn hungarian-ass language where they are a minority
(09:23:45)<joe6pack>Numeron: HUNGARIAN SYMPATHIZER!!!
(09:23:46)<konijn_nyt>valentine's day is Catholic from the start
(09:23:52)<deveah>and they treat us like shit in our own country
(09:24:01)<xGrue>DJGPP good for windows?
(09:24:07)<konijn_nyt>hmmm
(09:24:09)<konijn_nyt>old
(09:24:39)<deveah>and i'm all anti-hungarian anti-gipsy anti-valentinesday anti-hungarian AND anti-hungarian
(09:24:39)<xGrue>any other suggestions?
(09:24:50)<joe6pack>Numeron is a magyar enabler 
(09:24:58)<deveah>yarr arr
(09:25:11)<Numeron>the catholic holidays we have today are such bastardized versions of what they are supposed to be anyway... just look at santa clause and xmas trees and stuff.. where the f does that come from? to me valentines day is totally not religious, but is a day to recognise love and relationships
(09:25:37)<deveah>now, the ass-licking hunarians posted anti-romanian clips on the web because they want all our resources and to destroy us
(09:25:44)<deveah>clips=vids
(09:25:52)<joe6pack>a day to recognize the exchange of flowers&cards for sex
(09:26:07)<Numeron>who doesnt like sex?
(09:26:10)<Numeron>:P
(09:26:24)<deveah>hunagrians - they like calling us names

(10:02:37)<konijn_mac>yes
(10:02:42)<konijn_mac>you are added to the project ;)
(10:02:47)<Glowie>Were you ignoring queries a moment ago?
(10:02:57)<konijn_mac>My laptop died
(10:03:01)<Glowie>Oh.
(10:03:08)<konijn_mac>one of my kids had disconnected the power cable
(10:03:13)<Glowie>I tried to query you, but I can ask here too
(10:03:13)<Glowie>Haha
(10:03:26)<Glowie>Do you know where I could find Mac's platform dependent functions with documentation?
(10:03:33)<konijn_mac>oooh
(10:03:35)<konijn_mac>sure
(10:03:38)<konijn_mac>hold on
(10:03:40)<Glowie>Excellent :)
(10:03:42)<konijn_mac>it's heavy though
(10:03:47)<Glowie>No worries
(10:04:10)<Glowie>I'm trying to make things as easy as possible for the one who compiles my game for Mac
(10:04:13)<konijn_mac>C language right ?
(10:04:15)<Glowie>Yes
(10:04:21)<konijn_mac>uhm, curses ?
(10:04:33)<konijn_mac>or graphical ?
(10:04:48)<konijn_mac>if it is curses, it should compile just fine
(10:04:53)<konijn_mac>Mac -> BSD
(10:04:54)<Glowie>Curses
(10:05:02)<Glowie>But I use some platform dependent functions
(10:05:05)<konijn_mac>so you dont need any stinkin' documentation

(05:02:33)<jomiolto>hmm, jice doesn't irc here by any chance?
(05:06:59)<oeb>joe, that bot could get quickly hated, response to help should probably be over /msg
(05:10:19)<joe6pack>you tell konijn_mac that
(05:10:36)<joe6pack>he's developing it 
(05:13:17)<joe6pack>but i think that's a good idea
(05:13:53)<joe6pack>you should write it down here: http://code.google.com/p/rgrdbot/issues/entryhttp://code.google.com/p/rgrdbot/issues/entry
(05:14:48)<joe6pack>oeb: do you have a google account? like gmail for example?
(05:18:42)<oeb>yup
(05:19:01)<joe6pack>what's your gmail address? 
(05:19:21)<oeb>what.will.i.do.with.a.gig@gmail.com
(05:19:41)<joe6pack>good
(05:19:51)<joe6pack>now you can enter your bug report 
(05:20:29)<joe6pack>http://code.google.com/p/rgrdbot/issues/entry
(05:20:44)<joe6pack>i pasted it twice by mistake the 1st time 
(05:21:09)<jomiolto>nice, I didn't know google groups automagically cut long lines, so I did my own formatting and now the post came out all wonky :/
(05:22:09)<joe6pack>yea, just write it without thinking about new lines, it'll be ok
(05:22:37)<jomiolto>hmm, and I think it used my nick name too, instead of my real name
(05:22:43)<jomiolto>I wonder where I can change that?
(05:22:50)<jomiolto>nothing in the profile thingy...
(05:23:13)<joe6pack>https://www.google.com/accounts/EditUserInfo?hl=en

(05:23:39)<jomiolto>ah, thanks joe6pack 
(05:23:47)<joe6pack>:)
(05:23:49)<joe6pack>np
(05:25:04)<joe6pack>oeb: 1 step closer to haveing you take over bot development... 
(05:25:07)<jomiolto>hah, it didn't allow me to leave the nickname blank, so I entered my real name to it: bad google page design 0 - me 1 :)
(05:35:29)<oeb>Step 1: Raise Issue
(05:35:38)<oeb>Step 2: Re-Learn Java
(05:35:43)<oeb>Step 3: ???
(05:35:50)<oeb>Step 4: Profit!
(05:36:07)<joe6pack>you don't need to learn a lot of java. just look at the code already written 
(05:36:48)<oeb>Ok Step 3: is overcome my all consuming lazyness.
(05:36:52)<joe6pack>it shouldn't be difficult to modify the help command to append a "/msg nick" to the answer 
(05:38:15)<oeb>Got an interesting book yesterday, amongst other things it talks about writing a 3d maze application in javascript. Thinking about taking it and sticking a random maze generator in there.
(07:19:32)<RotateMe>:D great story (link of the day)
(07:22:30)<joe6pack>should change it to this one, for eyenot: http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/cursesix.html
(07:22:57)<joe6pack>he was complaining about the lack of a standard way to do all kinds of terminal handling 
(07:23:10)<joe6pack>but curses *is* a standard 
(07:23:28)<joe6pack>it is an offcial part of The Single UNIX Specification
(07:24:03)<joe6pack>so every conforming platform *must* provide a curses implementation 
(07:28:48)<joe6pack>quote curses, http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/cursesix.html

(07:43:35)<RotateMe>has the pircbot methods for sending files? it would be cool if he could send you the log.txt on request
(07:49:06)<joe6pack>not that i know of
(07:49:19)<joe6pack>but go ahead, add it to the list...

(07:51:50)<RotateMe>google code is just as slow as scourceforge, no?
(07:57:38)<RotateMe>well all the stuff from the todo and ideas section should go there
(07:57:51)<RotateMe>i think there are some points left but the botowner has to look at this

(08:48:07)<cakeboy>SNOW DAY
(08:48:10)<cakeboy>snow day today
(08:49:11)<joe6pack>haven't seen snow in a *long* while
(08:49:21)<joe6pack>it's 13C outside 
(08:56:19)<cakeboy>first snow day in my 4 semesters of college
(08:56:24)<cakeboy>(that i didn't declare myself)
(08:56:55)<RotateMe>i forgot how good crawl was... killed my third char today
(08:57:14)<RotateMe>two times by friggin sigmund
(08:57:31)<joe6pack>that sigmund is something, isn't he?
(08:57:47)<joe6pack>i also often get killed by ghosts of past players 
(09:00:27)<cakeboy>happens to me a lot too
(09:00:46)<cakeboy>i'm no good at crawl still  :(
(09:01:22)<joe6pack>jesus christ! 15c in February! 
(09:01:23)<RotateMe>are those tutorials new? they're awesome
(09:01:35)<RotateMe>in vienna?
(09:01:37)<joe6pack>which tutorials?
(09:01:46)<RotateMe>in crawl ss
(09:01:47)<joe6pack>yes
(09:01:58)<RotateMe>that's sure hot for vienna
(09:01:59)<joe6pack>(to the weather, not the tuts)
(09:02:09)<joe6pack>yes
(09:02:21)<joe6pack>last winter was warm as well, though 
(09:02:22)<RotateMe>tutorials: press T in the char slection screen
(09:02:35)<joe6pack>never seen them
(09:02:43)<joe6pack>will take a look next time
(09:02:59)<joe6pack>have to get back to learning... :|
(09:03:10)<RotateMe>kk
(09:03:32)<joe6pack>damn, and in such a nice day as well
(09:06:12)<cakeboy>man
(09:06:15)<cakeboy>github is the greatest
(09:06:24)<cakeboy>i wish i had some beta invites to hand out
(09:16:13)<RotateMe>ooops, a cursed rings ring of teleportation :D
(09:16:17)<RotateMe>that's gonna be fun
(09:16:32)<RotateMe>cakeboy, what's github?
(09:17:45)<RotateMe>killed sigmund :D, with elvish arrows of ice
(09:19:31)<cakeboy>git is a version control system, it's my favorite so far
(09:19:43)<cakeboy>and github is a beta service that lets you host as many projects as you want
(09:19:49)<cakeboy>except it is beta and invite only :(
(09:20:14)<RotateMe>ah, too bad
(09:20:29)<RotateMe>well i've never done version control anyways...
(09:20:49)<cakeboy>it's cool when you have a couple different computers and you want to sync your projects
(09:20:53)<cakeboy>that what i use it for, anyway
(09:20:58)<cakeboy>plus it lets everyone else have access to it
(09:21:04)<RotateMe>for some reason i never had problems but i can sure think of times when it would become handy
(09:21:16)<RotateMe>ah okay
(09:25:56)<cakeboy>i like how some games, just because i'm on linux, assume that i like the vi keys
(09:26:01)<cakeboy>i hate the vi keys
(09:37:55)<RotateMe>i don't like how i just got pwnd :(
(09:51:28)<deveah>hello all

(09:53:40)<deveah>oh, i've seen this on my mobile
(09:54:40)<joe6pack>deveah: why don't you take up the bot's development? i think konijn might have had enough of it 
(09:55:09)<deveah>in what language?
(09:55:13)<joe6pack>jasva
(09:55:14)<joe6pack>java]
(09:55:17)<joe6pack>java
(09:55:33)<joe6pack>but you don't need to know it before hand
(09:55:49)<joe6pack>just look at the code we have already written
(09:56:06)<deveah>hmmm.....
(09:56:11)<deveah>ok then
(09:56:16)<joe6pack>\o/
(09:57:27)<deveah>where's the download?
(09:57:45)<joe6pack>http://code.google.com/p/rgrdbot/source/checkout
(09:57:47)<joe6pack>but first
(09:58:11)<deveah>brb lunch
(09:58:28)<joe6pack>write konijn_mac and email and ask him to commit the changes (includeing the log) and turn it off on his computer
(09:58:49)<joe6pack>so that we get a consistent log

(11:02:53)<Aerton>hadn't you hear a story of a teacher who first turned the power off and then asked students to save their work?
(11:03:42)<Aerton>he was kind enough to turn it again on when they started to cry 
(11:03:52)<joe6pack_away>vim would let you do that anyway. you have to add a ! inorder to quit a file you've made changes to 
(11:04:07)<joe6pack_away>s/would/wouldn't 
(11:04:53)<Aerton>hush!
(11:04:54)<Aerton>I've told a whole story to hide my stupid typo!
(11:06:09)<Aerton>btw, after looking at your screenshot, I run vim alongside the irc on the same screen ^^
(11:06:32)<joe6pack_away>heh
(11:06:54)<joe6pack_away>i now run irssi on a second monitor 
(11:07:12)<deveah>what screenie?
(11:07:24)<joe6pack_away>should have thought about hooking it up to my laptop a long time ago

(11:08:23)<oeb>One of these days I will have the courage to install linux on my main desktop.
(11:08:45)<oeb>I can do all my work stuff on my laptop, and that runs ubuntu.
(11:08:53)<deveah>i think i'm gonna start a new rl - a med-sized one.
(12:27:23)<joe6pack>deveah: did you sent konijn an email?
(01:19:33)<deveah>reg
(01:19:51)<deveah>joe6pack no, busy with homework
(01:19:56)<joe6pack>ok
(01:20:07)<deveah>and i want to test something new now

(07:50:36)<RotateMe>whOOt! just started a char in crawl and equipped a cursed weapon... i wanted to throw him right away and start anew but i had still one scroll in my inventory
(07:51:04)<RotateMe>i read it for fun and "it [felt] like something [was] helping [me]"
(07:51:20)<RotateMe>the weapon was uncursed and the char can continue :D
(08:03:58)<RotateMe>hmm i think i will start to make an ascii mode for dungeonhunter
(08:55:57)<deveah_>i want a cave generator
(08:56:03)<deveah_>or a crypt generator
(08:56:06)<deveah_>or a map generator
(08:56:15)<deveah_>i don't care, i want it! :((
(09:01:08)<joe6pack>there are a ton of those in the internet 
(09:03:47)<Glowie>Write one yourself, it's a lot more fun
(09:04:37)<joe6pack>well yea, but he can get *inspired* by existing ones...
(09:05:09)<Glowie>Sure can
(09:05:34)<joe6pack>there is so much info about it that there's really no excuse not to do it
(09:09:52)<deveah_>i don't know where to start :/
(09:14:36)<joe6pack>you can start with this:
(09:14:46)<joe6pack>#include <curses.h>
(09:14:52)<joe6pack>int main(){
(09:14:54)<deveah>haha
(09:14:55)<deveah>lol
(09:15:07)<joe6pack>and at the end
(09:15:08)<joe6pack>}
(09:15:13)<joe6pack>now just fillup the gaps 
(09:15:25)<deveah>does curses.h have a generator?
(09:15:32)<joe6pack>for what?
(09:15:35)<joe6pack>for a map?
(09:15:38)<deveah>yes
(09:15:40)<joe6pack>no
(09:15:41)<deveah>if not then no
(09:15:52)<Glowie>I'd suggest reading the old roguelikedevelopment.org articles from RogueBasin
(09:15:56)<Glowie>Those gave me a good start
(09:16:01)<deveah>i'm going rogue.
(09:16:17)<deveah>rogue-style rooms
(09:16:22)<joe6pack>http://jice.nospam.googlepages.com/basicdungeongeneration
(09:16:45)<deveah>kind of like that
(09:17:02)<joe6pack>it explains exactly how to do it 
(09:28:12)<deveah>brb
(09:30:46)<Aerton>duh, just buy a pike from the general store and start to dig
(09:31:07)<Aerton>wands of stone to mud might be helpful, but the price bites
(09:38:09)<RotateMe>grumble... i have to prerender the ascii bitmaps to display them in different colors... what a crappy language :(
(09:42:18)<purestrain>encountered next bug in D :P
(10:25:57)<konijn_mac>I still prefer this one : http://kuoi.com/~kamikaze/GameDesign/art07_rogue_dungeon.php
(10:42:42)<joe6pack>i think the pics really help
(10:43:11)<joe6pack>makes it much easier to understand 
(10:46:58)<purestrain>and of course you can have a difficult passage, since the level is basically divided into two parts with one corridor
(10:47:09)<purestrain>puts lots of orcs there :-)
(10:47:30)<purestrain>and one goal on each side
(10:49:19)<konijn_mac>yeah, I dont know
(10:49:36)<konijn_mac>I guess I get my specs in textual format, so I can deal better with that ;)
(10:51:14)<purestrain>for the lazy ones http://dungeonmaker.sourceforge.net/
(10:53:00)<joe6pack>is that yours?
(10:53:15)<purestrain>no ;-)
(10:53:46)<joe6pack>the name sounds familiar 
(10:53:54)<joe6pack>but i don't remeber from where 
(10:54:45)<joe6pack>also
(10:54:50)<joe6pack>no screen shots 
(10:56:13)<purestrain>http://dungeonmaker.sourceforge.net/DM2_Manual/ <- here are some
(10:56:41)<joe6pack>oh yea
(01:53:58)<Nasareti1ainen>what the?
(01:54:09)<jomiolto>there
(01:54:31)<Glowie>Ate a few mushrooms, changed the name and forgot you did it?
(01:54:38)<jomiolto>I think I need to tweak my irssi settings :(
(01:54:57)<jomiolto>nah, it's just that I irc in two different networks, and irssi seems to default to the same nick in both of them
(01:56:12)<jomiolto>and, besides, you're making me sad, because it's winter and all the tasty 'shrooms are covered under a foot of snow :(
(01:56:33)<Glowie>I thought you had an in-door mushroom farm :b
(01:57:23)<jomiolto>nah, the one's grown by mother nature taste better (and given nicer hallucinations :)
(01:58:28)<jomiolto>sigh... 9pm already, and I was supposed to get some code done today :(
(01:58:50)<Glowie>I debugged one bastard of a bug for 2 hours ^_^
(01:59:03)<jomiolto>that's nice :)
(01:59:32)<Glowie>It wasn't that nice after 1,5 hours of debugging
(02:00:25)<jomiolto>well, at least for me it depends on what the bug if like; if it's something blindingly obvious that you should have noticed immediately, then it's not fun, but if it's something really obscure and difficult, then it's a great feeling to actually find the bug
(02:01:22)<Glowie>It was a great feeling, and it certainly wasn't obvious. Rather hard to reproduce too... The player had to be unarmed, paralyzed and use double strike special skill to make it appear :(
(02:01:40)<Glowie>(It was caused by overflowing message buffer when the player is paralyzed)
(02:01:48)<jomiolto>oh
(02:02:50)<jomiolto>it has sometimes taken me a week to find some similar bugs (although I didn't spend week doing just debugging, but also did some other stuff)
(02:03:12)<jomiolto>and, actually, I've once run into a bug in GCC, some years ago
(02:03:45)<jomiolto>that definitely wasn't fun when you spent a day debugging your code and found out that nothing was acutlly wrong...
(02:03:46)<Glowie>"And then I thought, ha! The bug must be in the compiler!" Something similar was someone's signature in RGRD :P
(02:04:13)<Glowie>Did you report that GCC's bug
(02:04:52)<jomiolto>nah, I didn't have a stable internet connection back then and I was actually using an old version
(02:05:16)<Glowie>Oh
(02:05:17)<jomiolto>I'm not sure I would have ever discovered the problem, had I not known assembler
(02:05:56)<Glowie>Nice, someone has benefited from knowing assembly :P
(02:06:01)<jomiolto>:D
(02:06:29)<Glowie>So, what's your next project now after Alan's success?
(02:06:31)<jomiolto>I actually like coding in assembler, but sadly it is about as far from portable as possible
(02:06:37)<Glowie>Hehe
(02:07:45)<jomiolto>Glowie: well, I'll continue working on my roguelike library, libexador, until it's ready for my next game, Dungeon of the Undead
(02:08:12)<jomiolto>DotU will also be quite small for a roguelike, something about the size of the original rogue, I reckon
(02:08:30)<Glowie>Will there be rotting flesh and yellowish bones?
(02:08:45)<jomiolto>perhaps in the tile graphics version :)
(02:09:19)<Glowie>Yay
(02:09:47)<jomiolto>DotU was actually my original distraction from the bigger roguelike I'm working on, Shadows of Exador
(02:10:24)<Glowie>The Exador screen I found seemed influenced by ADOM :P
(02:10:26)<jomiolto>... which in turn is something I want to get done before starting to really work on my dream roguelike :)
(02:10:33)<Glowie>Haha
(02:10:36)<Glowie>Vaporware after vaporware
(02:10:41)<jomiolto>Glowie: it is and very heavily so
(02:10:46)<jomiolto>at least in some respects
(02:12:23)<joe6pack>i haven't had a "dream roguelike"  in years
(02:13:11)<Glowie>You realized it's impossible to make it true?
(02:13:20)<joe6pack>yes
(02:13:23)<jomiolto>:(
(02:13:35)<joe6pack>at least it was at the time...
(02:13:38)<jomiolto>nanananana, I do not hear you, nanananana!
(02:13:43)<jomiolto>:)
(02:13:45)<joe6pack>i am a much better programmer now
(02:14:17)<joe6pack>but i think i prefer a series of 7drl's...
(02:14:40)<joe6pack>real life interfering with my game programming again
(02:15:00)<joe6pack>but i'm glad i did the 7drl this year. i think i will do another one next year
(02:17:59)<jomiolto>hmm, that cryptrover yours?
(02:18:09)<joe6pack>yes
(02:18:10)<jomiolto>seems interesting, I think I'll try it out
(02:18:19)<joe6pack>try the current versiopn
(02:18:47)<joe6pack>it has some fixes and extrsa features that the 7drl version didn't have 
(02:19:10)<jomiolto>well, I might try both of them actually
(02:19:36)<joe6pack>do you have svn installed?
(02:19:40)<jomiolto>but the 7day version is the one that interests me more (unless it has some crashing bugs?)
(02:19:46)<joe6pack>no,
(02:19:49)<jomiolto>yeah, I do
(02:19:53)<joe6pack>just minot bugs
(02:19:57)<joe6pack>"minor"
(02:20:04)<joe6pack>and 1 feature less
(02:20:13)<joe6pack>and is too easy :p
(02:20:39)<joe6pack>why is the 7drl version more interesting? 
(02:20:56)<joe6pack>current: svn checkout http://cryptrover.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cryptrover
(02:21:00)<jomiolto>because it's made in 7 days :P
(02:21:15)<joe6pack>7drl: http://code.google.com/p/cryptrover/downloads/list
(02:21:48)<jomiolto>yeah, I already have the code and I compiled the game, I just a bit distracted by the source
(02:22:08)<joe6pack>how come?
(02:22:20)<jomiolto>well, I don't know, I just had to see it :)
(02:22:42)<joe6pack>i think the 7drl source is probably easier to understand though 
(02:23:18)<joe6pack>"proper" keyboard handleing isn't that easy 
(02:25:51)<jomiolto>oops, I was surrounded by monsters when I started, didn't survive very long :(
(02:26:10)<joe6pack>that's another thing that's been corrected in the current version
(02:26:20)<joe6pack>i think i will release it as the 1.0 version
(02:26:46)<joe6pack>but i'll sit on it till may 1st, make it a round 3 months between the 7drl version and 1.0
(02:27:23)<joe6pack>even though i haven't developed it at all after about ~1.5 weeks after the 7drl version
(02:27:49)<joe6pack>just in case something pops up...
(02:28:00)<joe6pack>and then i will leave it be forever 
(02:28:00)<jomiolto>hmm, I like the idea and the game seems really nice
(02:28:09)<joe6pack>thank you 
(02:28:52)<jomiolto>I don't know about too easy, though, I guess I'm really lousy player, since I died again :P
(02:28:59)<jomiolto>ran out of air
(02:29:02)<joe6pack>in the 7drl version?
(02:29:05)<jomiolto>yeah
(02:29:30)<joe6pack>well some guys on rgrm said it was too easy, take what you will out of that ;0
(02:29:43)<joe6pack>that was meant to be a ;)
(02:30:13)<joe6pack>i don't think the people who frequent rgrm are "normal" palyers
(02:31:25)<joe6pack>hey
(02:31:34)<joe6pack>now that i look at the downloads section
(02:31:48)<jomiolto>agh, I don't seem to get past level 5
(02:32:19)<joe6pack>glowie's hall of fame screenshot is from only 8 days after the 7drl release, and that one had pretty much everything in it 
(02:32:39)<joe6pack>i thought it took longer than taht 
(02:33:44)<jomiolto>are the later release(s) more difficult than the 7drl version?
(02:33:57)<joe6pack>i think they might be a bit more difficult 
(02:34:04)<jomiolto>oh, no :P
(02:34:11)<joe6pack>but you can just give yourself a bit more hp and air
(02:34:19)<jomiolto>heh
(02:34:24)<joe6pack>there is a #define AIR ...
(02:34:26)<joe6pack>somewhere
(02:35:31)<joe6pack>look at items.h
(02:35:41)<joe6pack>and change these lines at the top:
(02:35:46)<joe6pack>#define MED_CHARGE 3
(02:35:46)<joe6pack>#define AIR_CHARGE 21
(02:35:46)<joe6pack>#define BATTERY_CHARGE 34

(02:35:46)<joe6pack>#define AIR_NUM 4
(02:35:49)<joe6pack>#define BATTERY_NUM 3
(02:36:15)<jomiolto>nah, I'll just try to beat it fairly :)
(02:36:22)<joe6pack>the first 3 control how much each pack gives you and the last 3 how many of them there are at each level

(04:24:04)<RotateMe>hi, joe6bot
(04:24:13)<RotateMe>randomquote
(04:24:13)<null>crack: <DaEezT> Cracks and Crevices sounds liek a porn movie
(04:24:26)<oeb>RotateMe, no, I drink =P
(04:25:04)<RotateMe>well than that's no difference to uni life (aside from the fact that there are very few real "pubs" in germany)
(04:25:15)<oeb>I skipped the whole uni thing and worked out fine. That being said I would be unlikely to hire someone without a degree, unless their portfolio really impressed me of course
(04:25:29)<oeb>RotateMe, Well I also get paid.
(04:25:37)<oeb>(Not for drinking)
(04:25:52)<RotateMe>striptease? =)
(04:26:01)<oeb>Something like that =P
(04:26:15)<joe6pack>RotateMe: what? there are a ton of pubs in germany 
(04:26:20)<oeb>I head up a PHP dev team in Ireland. I drink in my spare time.
(04:26:33)<RotateMe>it's called bars here
(04:26:39)<oeb>I know a few lads who went to germany for 6 months to study, and they did not leave the pub.
(04:26:42)<joe6pack>same thing
(04:26:43)<oeb>pub === bar
(04:27:00)<oeb>In ireland anyway the words are interchangable.
(04:27:26)<RotateMe>well we have pubs who especially address irish (and for some reason american and english) people
(04:27:52)<joe6pack>in canada a pub is where you'd go with other guys to watch a hockey match and a bar is where you'd go to find women
(04:27:53)<RotateMe>if it's the same thing, i agree, we have tons here
(04:28:15)<RotateMe>i live in heidelberg, it's got the most bars in one street in the whole friggin world
(04:28:21)<RotateMe>(unproven fact)
(04:28:44)<joe6pack>heh
(04:29:02)<joe6pack>i have heard this "fact" said about many, many cities
(04:29:06)<oeb>In Ireland a pub club bar or boozer is a place that serves alcohol, may serve food.
(04:29:14)<RotateMe>well it's also the longest pedestrian zone in europe so that's not such a great fact
(04:29:39)<oeb>You can pick up women anywhere, easier at night though rather than sunday afternoon when they are sitting down for lunch with their parents.
(04:29:41)<joe6pack>i would also take that one with a grain of salt 
(04:30:01)<RotateMe>what i hate is clubs
(04:30:20)<RotateMe>at least, again, the german definition of it
(04:30:36)<oeb>Most clubs here tend to have a bar at the front and a disco / nightclub at the back.
(04:30:44)<oeb>That's different in the cities though.
(04:30:54)<RotateMe>a place where you have to pay to get in, to get even more expensive drinks, get looked at because you're wearing a pullover instead of something stylish
(04:31:23)<RotateMe>and probably get thrown out when you drink too much
(04:31:24)<joe6pack>i have stopped going to clubs a long time ago
(04:32:02)<RotateMe>if i have to pay to get in and there's no good live musiv it's a no go area for me too
(04:32:12)<RotateMe>*music
(04:33:22)<RotateMe>and bars/pubs are not as good as they've been when you were allowed to smoke inside :(
(04:34:03)<joe6pack>hah
(04:34:12)<joe6pack>in vienna nobody gives a shit about that law
(04:34:41)<joe6pack>that's part of the reason i hate going out here. i always come back stinking of cigarette smoke
(04:34:52)<oeb>I don't pay to go into any clubs around here =P
(04:35:16)<oeb>(I worked as a doorman for a few years)
(04:37:10)<RotateMe>the prices for drinks suck in most clubs though
(04:37:15)<RotateMe>and the drinks themselves

(09:15:07)<ido>anyone know of a sort of tutorial on how to program telnet applications like crawl/nethack's public server?
(09:32:59)<oeb>Earthquakes in England last night. 4.5 on the scale!
(09:33:51)<joe6pack>4.5 is nothing 
(09:33:56)<DaEezT>i read something about 5.3
(09:34:11)<joe6pack>that's also not really noteworthy 
(09:35:09)<joe6pack>Earthquakes get interesting when buildings collapse and/or people are dieing 
(09:39:02)<oeb>It's something for England

(04:26:53)<joe6pack>what's up?
(04:28:32)<Aerton>ido> anyone know of a sort of tutorial on how to program telnet applications like crawl/nethack's public server?
(04:28:46)<Aerton>funny coicendence :)
(04:28:46)<joe6pack>Aerton: indeed
(04:28:50)<joe6pack>why?
(04:29:14)<joe6pack>i was thinking of posting the quesetion to the newsgroup 
(04:29:16)<Aerton>there is one in development for 2 days :)
(04:29:22)<joe6pack>by you?
(04:29:26)<Aerton>yes
(04:29:31)<joe6pack>:)
(04:29:50)<joe6pack>then maybe you can write a tutorial of sorts...
(04:30:03)<joe6pack>how's it going? easy? difficult?
(04:30:42)<Aerton>easier, if you are familiar with unix system programming
(04:30:49)<joe6pack>ok
(04:31:02)<joe6pack>which language are you developing it in?
(04:31:07)<Aerton>C
(04:31:11)<joe6pack>great
(04:31:29)<joe6pack>then maybe i can take a look at your system
(04:31:46)<joe6pack>(after i finish studying to all my exams) 
(04:31:59)<Aerton>:)
(04:32:09)<Aerton>is there a lot of them left?
(04:32:16)<joe6pack>yes :(
(04:32:25)<joe6pack>it will be a while
(04:32:51)<joe6pack>and i will also have quite a few courses in the coming semester
(04:33:01)<joe6pack>so until the summer i will not have a lot of free time
(04:33:26)<Aerton>I *hope* to get at least something of prototype-quality before 7DRL 2008
(04:33:37)<joe6pack>ok
(04:33:43)<joe6pack>good
(04:33:54)<joe6pack>i will now go back to learning 
(06:36:48)<deveah>hello
(06:43:42)<ido_>Aerton: ftp://ftp.alt.org/pub/dgamelaunch/
(06:44:11)<ido_>it can actually be used to start any game
(06:44:36)<ido_>there is nothing nethack specific there
(06:44:46)<ido_>or the README says
(06:48:04)<ido_studying>quote telnet, ftp://ftp.alt.org/pub/dgamelaunch/
(06:48:16)<ido_studying>getquote telnet
(06:48:16)<null>telnet(0):  ftp://ftp.alt.org/pub/dgamelaunch/
(07:03:06)<Glowie>Yeah it can, but it's not guaranteed to work with all games
(07:03:49)<Glowie>I spent one day fiddling with it with Napkin (he runs a Crawl server and wants to add more games), but we couldn't get watching to work with Frozen Depths. Most likely a ttyrec problem after a lot of experimenting
(07:03:57)<Glowie>Aerton is able to fix that :P
(07:06:51)<ido_studying>ttyrec?
(07:07:11)<Glowie>A program that records console
(07:07:17)<Glowie>For example roguelikes
(07:07:24)<joe6pack>oh ok
(07:07:35)<Glowie>DGameLaunch uses it to provide the watching feed for people
(07:08:17)<joe6pack>why would it work differently with fd? if it's just a normal curses program
(07:08:38)<Glowie>I have no idea
(07:09:06)<Glowie>It misdrew parts of the screen
(07:09:08)<Glowie>Very weird stuff
(07:09:22)<joe6pack>strange 
(07:12:21)<joe6pack>well dgl uses curses itself. maybe it setups some options in a way that fd didn't expect? 
(07:12:29)<Glowie>Perhaps Aerton's thingie will support all roguelikes
(07:12:42)<Glowie>But it's not DGL, it's ttyrec
(07:12:50)<Glowie>Playing the game worked fine
(07:12:52)<Epyon_>S*** telnet server lol
(07:12:52)<Glowie>But not watching
(07:13:19)<Glowie>We even tried with just ttyrec and it screwed the video too
(07:13:27)<joe6pack>hrm
(07:13:37)<joe6pack>so the problem isn't dgl
(07:13:50)<Glowie>Indirectly I'd say :P
(07:13:53)<Glowie>DGL uses ttyrec
(07:13:56)<Glowie>So it's both of their problem
(07:15:31)<joe6pack>he will have to write or find an alternative for ttyrec then
(07:16:00)<joe6pack>and if he does maybe the dgl can be used with that... oh well
(07:16:08)<joe6pack>we'll see what he comes up with
(07:16:43)<Glowie>He has written a watching telnet program once already
(07:16:55)<joe6pack>link?
(07:16:58)<Glowie>So he'll write an alternative, but most likely an integrated one so it can't be used with it
(07:17:14)<Glowie>Unfortunately it was only for our private use and isn't online
(07:17:21)<Glowie>The sources might be on Aerton's old computer still

(10:11:49)<joe6pack>just finished 3 games of warcraft 3. it's been quite some time since i've played that game regularly 
(10:11:58)<joe6pack>i won every match :)
(10:12:19)<kinnala>I used to play c&c:generals a lot
(10:12:24)<joe6pack>but i was palying against total novices 
(10:12:25)<kinnala>it was a fun game to play with friends
(10:12:38)<kinnala>got wc3 also
(10:13:01)<joe6pack>are you good at it?
(10:13:09)<kinnala>no :-D
(10:13:21)<joe6pack>did you play on battle.net?
(10:13:29)<kinnala>few times
(10:13:42)<joe6pack>it's not an easy game to master

(10:14:20)<kinnala>you lose much in the beginning

(10:14:43)<kinnala>just like every 1on1 game
(10:14:49)<joe6pack>i'm not that good at it either, but i am at least at a level where i don't lose all the time
(10:15:08)<joe6pack>you can play teams though, easier to learn i guess
(10:16:14)<joe6pack>and every race is also totally different; i can play alright with the humans, elves and orcs but i almost haven't played the undead at all

(05:30:36)<ido>i just sent an email to this girl, asking if she wants to watch the new coen brothers film
(05:30:43)<ido>i hope she does
(05:31:44)<ido>nothing motivates one to find a new girlfriend like finding out one's ex has a new boyfriend 
(05:38:50)<oeb>New Coen bros film kicks ass
(05:39:01)<ido>so i have heard
(05:39:08)<oeb>Although I took two girls to see it and neither one 'got' it. So beware.
(05:39:30)<jraregris>high five!
(05:39:46)<oeb>I ment the movie. They did get the other thing.
(05:39:52)<ido>well i think this one is different 
(05:40:05)<ido>she liked fight club 
(05:40:08)<oeb>It's quite abstract.
(05:40:18)<ido>i don't know any other girl who liked fight club
(05:41:40)<oeb>I know a couple.
(05:42:34)<ido>well we'll see 
(05:42:40)<oeb>Sitting in the cinema after the movie finished was funny though. Nearly every couple in there had one person going 'That was the best movie ever' and another going 'What the fuck was that about? That makes no bloody sense!'
(05:42:54)<ido>haha
(05:43:05)<ido>so it will also double as an iq test 
(05:43:07)<oeb>Read the book too. Cormac McCarthy is a good writer.
(05:43:22)<ido>to see if i should try to go any further with her
(05:43:22)<oeb>It's not IQ, it just requires kinda abstract thinking.
(05:43:46)<ido>the trailer didn't seem so abstract 
(05:43:57)<ido>just some guy going on a killing rampage 
(05:44:03)<oeb>It does not start off abstract.
(05:44:19)<oeb>It's the ending is a bit of a mind fuck. It's what the charachters represent.
(05:44:25)<ido>ok
(05:44:36)<oeb>It's the conclusion of the story that really sours it for people that did not get it.
(05:44:46)<ido>let's not talk about it anymore
(05:44:54)<oeb>Ohh no spoilers from me.
(05:45:04)<ido>:)
(05:45:18)<ido>i still rather be as surprised as possible 
(05:45:22)<oeb>Also, if you like reading, also try 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy. Very good book.

(06:01:51)<jraregris>are any of you aware of any form of documentation on jcurses (apart from the javadoc)?
(06:04:46)<RotateMe>sry can't help you there :(
(06:09:50)<jraregris>i think I'll move away from the `urge' to make my game dgamelaunch-compatible, at least for now, and rather do a pseudo-ascii thing like DF or something
(06:10:48)<Aerton>I think curses for java were discussed more the once on rgrd
(06:13:35)<ido>they were
(06:13:54)<ido>there isn't a really good platform independent way to do it
(06:15:45)<Aerton>:(
(06:16:28)<ido>i would write my own wrapper around curses and provide a windows and linux binary with the java classes
(06:27:13)<jraregris>that's pretty much what jcurses does, i guess. and i might come around to it some time, but just now I'd rather make a roguelike than a library wrapper iykwim
(06:27:33)<ido>yes
(06:27:52)<ido>i want to give swig a try some day
(06:28:00)<ido>but i never seem to get to ti

(06:37:43)<jraregris>yeah, swing has all the documentation jcurses doesn't have times a million
(06:39:32)<ido>yes, it seems to be very well documented and comes highly recommended 
(06:39:43)<ido>oh

(11:09:57)<ido>morning Numeron 
(11:15:07)<Numeron>heya
(11:18:03)<Numeron>im having trouble getting a return string from an array of mobiles(superclass for all npcs), looks like: town.mobile[x][y].name  returns nothing or crashes, whereas getting health or anything other than a string seems to work fine :S
(11:18:31)<joe6pack>are all the rest primitives?
(11:18:42)<joe6pack>like int or bool?
(11:19:09)<Numeron>yep.. there is one other string which is says, and returns a line of convo
(11:19:20)<Numeron>it doesnt work either
(11:19:23)<joe6pack>try allocation on the heap 
(11:19:29)<joe6pack>with malloc 
(11:20:36)<Numeron>never heard of this function..
(11:20:45)<joe6pack>are you programming in c?
(11:20:50)<Numeron>c++
(11:21:00)<joe6pack>it is called "new" in c++
(11:21:44)<Numeron>ive found it at www.cplusplus.com, give me 5m to play with it
(11:22:44)<joe6pack>i think malloc is supposidly not "good c++" or something.
(11:22:50)<joe6pack>but i don't know
(11:23:01)<joe6pack>i can tell you how i would have done it in c :)
(11:25:10)<Numeron>"good" or "bad" c++ doesnt worry me much... i cant seem to understand how it works anyway though :\ its used in my mobile class...?
(11:25:28)<joe6pack>how the "new" keyword works?
(11:25:39)<Numeron>oh i know how that works
(11:25:47)<Numeron>ahh i get you
(11:26:04)<Numeron>i thought you meant it was new to c++
(11:26:20)<joe6pack>:)
(11:26:50)<joe6pack>http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/dynamic.html
(11:34:26)<joe6pack>did you figure it out or is it still not working?
(11:35:14)<Numeron>havent been able to get it :(
(11:38:33)<joe6pack>paste the line where you define your string
(11:38:43)<joe6pack>and the line where you put something in it
(11:40:46)<Numeron>string name;//public global     name = "No name";//inside constructor
(11:41:13)<joe6pack>i guess "string" is from the STL or something?
(11:41:29)<Numeron>using namespace std yeah
(11:41:31)<joe6pack>because i haven't used that in a _long_ while...
(11:42:55)<joe6pack>i can tell you how i would do it with char*, which is the c wawy of doing it 
(11:43:09)<Numeron>do, ill try it
(11:43:21)<joe6pack>but maybe someone who knows c++ can help?
(11:45:36)<Numeron>...i might set up some accessor methods and see if i can pinpoint where the f up happens
(11:47:02)<joe6pack>it happens when you leave the function scope and the stack is trashed
(11:47:10)<joe6pack>give me a min i'll write an example
(11:50:39)<joe6pack>char ** some_function(){
(11:50:43)<joe6pack>	char** str= malloc(sizeof(char)*50 );
(11:50:43)<joe6pack>	*str="1234\n";
(11:50:43)<joe6pack>	return str;
(11:50:43)<joe6pack>}
(11:50:51)<joe6pack>main(){ printf(*some_function());
(11:50:52)<joe6pack>}
(11:51:33)<joe6pack>that way the content of the string is not trashed after you leave the function some_function()
(11:52:29)<Numeron>i cant define anything in the global scope without it being static though can i?
(11:52:43)<joe6pack>?
(11:53:10)<joe6pack>of course you can define pointers in the global scope
(11:53:48)<joe6pack>you just don't allocate the memory in the global scope
(11:54:55)<Numeron>hmm. ill see what i can do
(11:55:26)<joe6pack>char **str;
(11:55:26)<joe6pack>void some_function(){ str= malloc(sizeof(char)*50 ); *str="1234\n";
(11:55:32)<joe6pack>}
(11:55:57)<joe6pack>dammit why does it paste it in such a crappy way
(11:56:08)<joe6pack>char **str;
(11:56:10)<joe6pack>void some_function(){
(11:56:13)<joe6pack>    str= malloc(sizeof(char)*50 );
(11:56:17)<joe6pack>    *str="1234\n";
(11:56:20)<joe6pack>}
(11:56:26)<joe6pack>main(){
(11:56:28)<joe6pack>    some_function();
(11:56:30)<joe6pack>    printf(*str);
(11:56:34)<joe6pack>}
(11:56:48)<joe6pack>in that case str is in the global scope
(11:58:06)<Numeron>i see
(11:58:59)<Numeron>i have:
(11:59:08)<Numeron>uh hang on
(11:59:19)<joe6pack>maybe give a link instead
(12:00:20)<Numeron>name = malloc(sizeof(char)*50 );
(12:00:26)<Numeron>*name = "Default";
(12:00:42)<joe6pack>yes
(12:00:45)<Numeron>gives compiler error: 
(12:00:46)<Numeron>ambiguous overload for 'operator=' in '((Mobile*)this)->Mobile::name = malloc(50u)' 
(12:01:10)<joe6pack>what is the type of name?
(12:01:24)<joe6pack>should be "char **name;"
(12:01:46)<Numeron>ah
(12:02:15)<joe6pack>again, this is the c way of doing things. if you want to use the stl this is not the way to go
(12:02:36)<Numeron>name = malloc(sizeof(char)*50 ); is invalid conversion from void* to char** :(
(12:03:45)<joe6pack>oh yea
(12:04:04)<Numeron>i think i might jsut continue to shotgun program it for a while... ahh something so seemingly trivial after the awesomeness of getting walls in lit rooms to light up when viewed from the lit side but stay dark otherwise :(
(12:04:20)<joe6pack>there was a bug in my code
(12:05:59)<joe6pack>try with 1 star
(12:06:05)<joe6pack>char *str;
(12:06:08)<joe6pack>void some_function(){
(12:06:12)<joe6pack>    str= malloc(sizeof(char)*50 );
(12:06:17)<joe6pack>    *str="1234\n";
(12:06:21)<joe6pack>}
(12:06:52)<joe6pack>anyway
(12:07:24)<joe6pack> you should find out how to do this with new and and string, since this is the way it probably should be done in c++
(12:08:16)<Numeron>invalid from void* to char*, i will try to get it with new
(12:08:29)<joe6pack>oh wait what am i writing...
(12:13:12)<joe6pack>char *str;
(12:13:15)<joe6pack>void some_function(){
(12:13:19)<joe6pack>    str= malloc(sizeof(char)*50 );
(12:13:22)<joe6pack>    strcpy(str,"1234\n");
(12:13:25)<joe6pack>}
(12:14:19)<joe6pack>damn have to start studying :(
(12:14:25)<joe6pack>have a nice day
(12:14:28)<joe6pack>and good luck
(12:16:51)<Numeron>i think i jsut got it... by pure fluke while looking into something else i discovered that in my game.h i have Map town; and also have in the constructor Game(){ town = Map();  ...
(12:17:43)<Numeron>so it initialised town twice, making it funky for whatever reason
(12:18:11)<joe6pack>i hope you are freeing all that dynamic memory at some point ;)
(12:18:53)<joe6pack>i try to use the stack as much as possible, since it's sometimes such a pain in the ass, what with memory leaks and all
(12:19:57)<joe6pack>i am sure that if you don't know why it works now and why it didn't work before that you are doing something wrong and it will come up again in the future 
(12:20:12)<joe6pack>ideally you should understand what your program is doing 
(12:20:14)<joe6pack>which is
(12:20:20)<joe6pack>incedentally 
(12:20:27)<joe6pack>the reason why i don't program in c++ :)
(12:20:36)<Numeron>you are absoluetly correct. thanks for your help though, 'tis appreciated
(12:20:44)<joe6pack>no problem
(12:20:56)<Numeron>i got a job yesterday with fujitsu working with java, so i wont have that problem anyway
(12:21:10)<Numeron>im excited. first job of my career
(12:21:14)<joe6pack>with all that buggy code i pasted here, wasn't that helpfull...
(12:21:34)<joe6pack>is it a c++ job?
(12:21:55)<Numeron>java and the oh so not sexy plsql
(12:22:18)<joe6pack>well you will at least not have these problems in java :0
(12:22:37)<Numeron>yeah i know, go team garbage collector :P
(12:22:38)<joe6pack>everything is on the heap anyway 
(12:22:51)<joe6pack>oh yea, and you don't have to free it yourself...
(12:24:01)<joe6pack>i blame my problems with memory allocation to the fact that almost all of my experience comes from using java and python 
(12:24:08)<joe6pack>that's why i started getting into c,
(12:24:35)<joe6pack>you have to learn these things sometime. and you won't learn it from java, python or scheme
(12:24:36)<Numeron>c is pretty hard edge with memory hey?
(12:24:55)<joe6pack>same as c++, as far as i can tell
(12:25:12)<joe6pack>in c++ you just use new and delete instead of malloc and free
(12:26:17)<Numeron>at uni i was taught java, and half way through my course everything switched over to c++ and i had to learn it on the fly while being taught advanced programming techniques... so most things to do with memory are pretty much beyond me
(12:26:19)<joe6pack>i think cryptrover was the 2nd "real" c program that i've written 
(12:26:55)<joe6pack>yea it was the same way for me. but since cs is not my major i only did c and c++ in 1 course
(12:27:23)<joe6pack>so i try to learn it myself by programming rougelikes in c :)
(12:27:56)<Numeron>its a good way, especially with small disposable rls like the 7day ones
(12:28:02)<joe6pack>yes
(12:28:20)<Numeron>are you still working on cryptrover btw?
(12:28:36)<joe6pack>as basic as my c skills are now, they are leaps and bounds better developed than they were before i did cryptrover 
(12:28:39)<joe6pack>no
(12:28:46)<joe6pack>haven't touched it in a while
(12:29:08)<Numeron>fair enough.
(12:29:39)<joe6pack>i think i'll leave it as it is. simple and small
(12:31:30)<Numeron>aye. ive not touched crown, but then again im working on a large scale version atm anyway lol
(12:32:28)<joe6pack_studyi>hoping the nick will make me actually start studying for my exam :O
(12:32:41)<hopbot>PEOPLE
(12:33:01)<hopbot>oh man
(12:33:08)<hopbot>semester starts in 2 days
(12:33:52)<hopbot>I have to find my bag and pencil case, get supplies, find out about the buses, buy text and course books, pay the fees, start waking up 5 hours earlier, etc, etc :(
(12:34:37)<Numeron>you'll be right, first week is all plaigarism statements and "this is what you're going to learn" and rubbish like that
(12:34:55)<hopbot>not in my experience
(12:35:10)<hopbot>normally they do that for between 5 minutes and one lecture
(12:36:27)<Numeron>i guess. im usually pretty lax during my first week :P
(12:36:40)<hopbot>well me too
(12:37:04)<hopbot>but I haven't prepared in the slightest, and I'm busy with things this weekend

(05:01:22)<jomiolto>so, I guess I'll just drink as usual (not that I'm already drunk...)
(05:02:02)<oeb>It's ok, I only sobered up about 4 hours ago. And I have been at work for 7.
(05:02:24)<jomiolto>I've been drinkin almost the whole day, and I'm only getting drunk just now ;)
(05:02:38)<jomiolto>j√§germeister is a good medicin for sore throat
(05:02:40)<oeb>What time zone are you in?
(05:02:41)<jomiolto>:)
(05:02:56)<jomiolto>oeb: Finland
(05:03:04)<oeb>What's that? GMT+2?
(05:03:07)<jomiolto>UTC+2 or +3, don't remember :/
(05:03:15)<DaEezT>too drunk already :D
(05:03:17)<oeb>It's 16.11 here now.
(05:03:24)<DaEezT>17:09 here
(05:03:30)<jomiolto>18:11 here now
(05:03:38)<oeb>Ohh ok, 2 ahead.
(05:03:55)<oeb>I wanna go on the beer again tonight! I'll have to wait till tomorrow though.
(05:04:09)<oeb>Guess I'll have to go back to fucking around with SVG tonight.
(05:04:09)<jomiolto>why?
(05:04:22)<oeb>I have my son on Friday nights.
(05:04:35)<jomiolto>SVG=vector gra√•hics, or something else?
(05:04:44)<oeb>Vector Graphics.
(05:04:47)<jomiolto>ok
(05:05:04)<oeb>Writing a graphing / Charting thing with PHP / Javascript.
(05:05:30)<jomiolto>:/
(05:05:38)<jomiolto>work or something else?
(05:06:10)<jomiolto>I'm personlly setting up Gentoo system for my home server ;)
(05:06:24)<oeb>Doing it for the hell of it.
(05:06:33)<oeb>Never used SVG with Javascript before.
(05:06:33)<jomiolto>hah :)
(05:06:47)<oeb>I'll probably find something to do with it for work though.
(05:08:09)<DaEezT>gentoo for home servers 4t2 \o/
(05:08:12)<DaEezT>4tw
(05:08:13)<DaEezT>D:
(05:08:14)<jomiolto>hmm, I should work on my roguelike library, but I think I'm too drunk :(
(05:09:35)<jomiolto>btw, anyone using source management system with their roguelikes/other projects?
(05:09:55)<DaEezT>we use svn at work
(05:09:56)<jomiolto>t I'm asking because I just set up git on my home server :)
(05:10:09)<jomiolto>never use any system before...
(05:10:13)<DaEezT>used to use cvs at uni
(05:10:21)<cakeboy>i use git a lot
(05:10:22)<jomiolto>always done backups, etc. by myself...
(05:10:27)<cakeboy>git is super
(05:10:36)<oeb>I dont use any source control or backups. I walk on the wild side.
(05:10:37)<jomiolto>git seems nice from the little I've used it
(05:10:39)<cakeboy>and actually really easy to use
(05:10:51)<oeb>Vodka and Pocket Protectors Baby!
(05:11:08)<jomiolto>It was even quite easy to set up, once I got past the initial difficulties
(05:11:24)<jomiolto>now I'll just see if it actually works fpr me
(05:12:05)<oeb>Does Git have decent windows clients? I have been meaning to set up source control on the ubuntu server at my feet for ages
(05:12:26)<jomiolto>the problem with doing the backups by myself is the fact that I might require different versions for different applications (for example Alan's Journey will require one that has exactly the same interface as the current version)
(05:12:49)<jomiolto>oeb: I don't know about windows clients rally, since I use Linux only :/
(05:13:00)<jomiolto>but I think there is supposed to be a windows port
(05:13:15)<oeb>Main work machines are windows =(
(05:13:50)<jomiolto>:(
(05:14:08)<cakeboy>oeb: yes
(05:14:24)<cakeboy>to actually push and pull with it might be hard, because you need an rsa keygen
(05:14:34)<cakeboy>and for some reason my windows one wouldn't generate proper keys
(05:14:51)<cakeboy>but it's real easy to check out and all that
(05:15:23)<jomiolto>well, I have a ssh thing setup already, so the rsa stuff is already setup ;)
(05:15:40)<jomiolto>All I need for a push is passwd/username
(05:41:59)<DaEezT>oeb really knows how to kill a conversation
(05:42:06)<DaEezT>arg
(05:42:07)<DaEezT>lol

(12:07:02)<jraregris>Yeah, that's close enough
(12:07:06)<jraregris>o/
(12:13:58)<Glowie>What's up? :P
(12:20:50)<jraregris>never mind me. I'm just over tired as we say in norwegian
(12:21:13)<Glowie>Okay
(12:21:46)<jraregris>I've had all week to lay out a magazine in InDesign, and i never really get started until its almost too late
(12:22:20)<jraregris>I've got procrastination problems
(12:23:08)<jraregris>so now I've been marking up word-documents and laying up for 14 hours straight
(12:24:16)<Glowie>:P
(12:27:14)<jraregris>it's usually when I've got something important work hovering over me that i get productive on all the 'everyday projects' I always intend on doing, but never seem to get around to
(12:28:17)<jraregris>like last night me and a friend made a php-script that helps you out on an ethical level
(12:29:24)<Glowie>Substitute work to replace the real work you'd have to do?
(12:29:29)<jraregris>if you're at a party and appear to be getting lucky with a girl, but she seems a bit young, and you're not all certain on if it's morally 'right' to have sexing with her
(12:29:35)<jraregris>yeah
(12:30:00)<jraregris>anyways, you enter your age and her age, and the script tells you to go ahead or let her be
(12:30:18)<jraregris>it works for girls too
(12:31:07)<Glowie>Haha
(12:31:12)<Glowie>And if the girl lies her age?
(12:31:57)<jraregris>our php has no way of telling lies from truth at this moment
(12:32:21)<Glowie>:P
(12:32:32)<jraregris>maybe we could add a credit card check up or something
(12:33:24)<jraregris>maybe we ought to implement a quiz to determine the age (like in leisure suit larry)
(12:33:54)<Glowie>Haha
(12:34:05)<Glowie>I remember guessing the questions when I was a kid
(12:39:59)<jraregris>me too
(12:40:44)<jraregris>and whene me and a mate played cannon fodder, we knew one of the possible key words (from the manual) and started the game about 50 times to get through

(11:30:48)<joe6pack>me neither 
(11:30:54)<joe6pack>but i liked it
(11:32:04)<joe6pack>anyone played Mines of Elderlore ?
(11:32:08)<deveah>nah
(11:33:55)<joe6pack>not providing an executable or requiring anything but standard gnu built tools to build seems like the best way to have no one play your game
(11:35:13)<joe6pack>oh i see he has an executable there now
(11:36:04)<joe6pack>heh readme.txt is the only file flaged as a binary... 
(11:37:18)<joe6pack>bugs
(11:37:31)<joe6pack>i get &/ as the player
(11:37:51)<joe6pack>and all the other tiles/chars are also 2 chars wide
(11:37:53)<TeeEmCee>what's wrong with only requiring standard gnu tools?
(11:38:02)<joe6pack>nothing
(11:38:03)<TeeEmCee>oh, I think I misread
(11:38:39)<TeeEmCee>what else did the author require?
(11:38:50)<joe6pack>actually requiring python is also ok. but numeric is normally not installed by default
(11:39:10)<joe6pack>i mean it's not that bad, it's the only thing i had to install
(11:40:41)<joe6pack>but he also didn't flag the right files as executables. had he not needed numeric, added a correct shebang and flaged moe.py as executable i wouldn't have even needed to know it's a python program
(11:40:46)<TeeEmCee>numeric is required by pygame, isn't it
(11:40:53)<joe6pack>would have just run it as a normal program
(11:40:57)<joe6pack>yes
(11:41:02)<joe6pack>but he didn't use pygame 
(11:41:16)<joe6pack>that's not required, just numeric 
(11:41:26)<joe6pack>which again, is not that terrible 
(11:41:57)<joe6pack>but i'm just saying, have as few barriers to compilation as possible 
(11:42:37)<joe6pack>a lot of times i wouldn't even bother twice with a game requiring anything more than "make" or "./configure && make"
(11:42:48)<joe6pack>unless i know in advance it's worth it
(11:43:40)<TeeEmCee>yikse!
(11:43:52)<TeeEmCee>I screwed up my timetabler
(11:44:01)<TeeEmCee>*timetablle
(11:44:04)<TeeEmCee>damn cat
(11:44:08)<joe6pack>:)
(11:44:40)<joe6pack>i really liked tinypy 
(11:44:53)<joe6pack>the vm is so small you can bundle it with your game
(11:45:19)<joe6pack>and really only be dependent on a c compiler and standard libs 
(11:48:16)<TeeEmCee>tinypy?
(11:48:37)<TeeEmCee>stripped down version of python, or a reimplementation?
(11:48:44)<TeeEmCee>I need sleep and stuff
(11:48:55)<joe6pack>reimplementation
(11:48:59)<TeeEmCee>I'll sort out my timetable mishap some other day
(11:49:02)<TeeEmCee>oh really?
(11:49:11)<joe6pack>yea
(11:49:14)<joe6pack>very small
(11:49:17)<TeeEmCee>interesting, I didn't know there was more than one python implementation
(11:49:26)<joe6pack>there are a lot of themn
(11:49:42)<joe6pack>jython, pypy, cpython...
(11:49:49)<TeeEmCee>besides wacky python-to-java-bytecode ones?
(11:49:59)<joe6pack>that would be jython 
(11:50:17)<TeeEmCee>(cheating)
(11:50:22)<joe6pack>i only used the standard c implementation till now 
(11:50:31)<joe6pack>why is that cheating? 
(11:50:38)<TeeEmCee>hehe
(11:50:40)<TeeEmCee>night
(11:59:35)<joe6pack>i'm off to
(11:59:40)<joe6pack>have t ostudy

(02:58:31)<Snarius>there could still be some artifact, but there could be a lot more to explore
(03:01:18)<_df_>well people complain with really big maps.. i dont know if players would like infinite sized maps.
(03:02:12)<_df_>people like constrained maps, fixed size type things that they can explore. they dont like.. infinite :)
(03:02:51)<Snarius>I just had an idea a while ago for a 'staff of passage'
(03:03:12)<Snarius>it would make a tunnel or portal to a different dungeon branch
(03:03:26)<Snarius>is it just me, or does that sound really neat?
(03:27:56)<_df_>code it and see if its good to play
(07:19:05)<TeeEmCee>hello
(07:19:12)<TeeEmCee>RL DEVELOPER POLL
(07:19:24)<TeeEmCee>does a game need permadeath to be a RL?
(07:19:50)<TeeEmCee>I think it's not totally necessary
(07:20:38)<TeeEmCee>there are often rl's on At Play with some sort of 'continue from last town with lost equipment' feature
(07:52:13)<Numeron>i dont think so. for me a roguelike is simply rogue-like. if its like rogue in some way then it passes the bar, but it doesnt have to be in every way
(07:52:52)<Numeron>permadeath is a good idea though
(07:53:04)<TeeEmCee>normally
(07:53:20)<TeeEmCee>well, for a traditional roguelike anyway
(07:53:21)<TeeEmCee>f
(07:53:37)<TeeEmCee>don't know if you count crown of the forest as a rl
(07:54:06)<Numeron>i count it as one. it has rpg features in a turn based ascii environment
(07:54:27)<TeeEmCee>but such a game shows permadeath can be replaced with other gameplay
(07:56:18)<Numeron>it does, but does that then exclude it from being a rl? my definition of a rl is very very loose
(07:56:53)<Numeron>is a rl without potions a rl?
(07:57:12)<TeeEmCee>definitely
(07:57:29)<TeeEmCee>that's easy
(07:57:45)<Numeron>then why is a rl without permadeath not a rl? permadeath is a feature jsut like potions are a feature, removing one doesnt make it any less rl
(07:57:56)<TeeEmCee>but it's possible to stray waaaay away from rogue, and still present the game the same
(07:58:16)<TeeEmCee>it seems like people care more about presentation than gameplay in their definitions
(07:58:56)<TeeEmCee>like you mentioned ascii
(08:00:28)<Numeron>well in crown, you run around, turnbased inside cells (ascii isnt important, since there are rls with tiles) casting spells, buying potions pwning other creatures, thats pretty much what a rl is: it jsut doesnt have down stairs and a different win condition
(08:01:39)<Numeron>and thats all gameplay
(08:01:58)<TeeEmCee>yeah, crown is still fairly close to rogue despite being a totally different idea
(08:02:10)<Numeron>therefore it is rogue-like
(08:02:17)<Numeron>:)
(08:02:23)<TeeEmCee>yep
(11:18:48)<ido>oeb: where you the one who told me about "no country for old men"?
(11:20:12)<oeb>Yup
(11:20:14)<oeb>Like it?
(11:20:20)<ido>it was pretty good 
(11:20:34)<ido>didn't see what was so "abstract" about it, though
(11:20:55)<oeb>Well the whole thing about yer man representing death rather than an actual villian
(11:21:12)<oeb>Especially important to see it that way to find meaning from the final scene.
(11:21:37)<oeb>Without that insight it seems like people saw no need for the crash at the end, and thought it left the movie without meaning or a clear end.
(11:22:26)<ido>do you Chigurh or Llewelyn?
(11:22:29)<oeb>People also seemed to think the movie was about the cowboy or the villian, when infact it was almost soley about the sherrif.
(11:22:43)<ido>huh
(11:22:50)<oeb>Chigurh is the villian llewelyn is the cowboy
(11:22:56)<ido>i didn't read so much meaning into it 
(11:23:01)<ido>yes i know,
(11:23:08)<ido>i asked which of them represented death
(11:23:13)<oeb>I just could not remember names.
(11:23:16)<ido>i guessed Chigurh
(11:23:19)<oeb>Yes.
(11:23:33)<oeb>The final scene shows how unstopable it is.
(11:24:07)<oeb>As in the cops could not take him, assasins could not take him, men could not take him. The car crash represents God or faith trying to stop him.
(11:24:10)<ido>i don't know. i think you are over analyzing it
(11:24:40)<oeb>I don't believe so. I think the movie has deeper meaning that it seems to have on the surface.
(11:24:56)<ido>maybe.
(11:25:00)<oeb>Speaking of movies, the new rambo movie is pretty nuts in a mindless action movie kinda way.
(11:25:37)<ido>i liked "there will be blood" much better than "no country for old men"
(11:25:48)<oeb>Don't expect an amazing story, but it's full of cool explosions, big gun fights and people getting their arms chopped off. Wrapped in enough of a story to make it watchable
(11:26:06)<ido>i don't think i'll go watch it
(11:26:34)<ido>i have been going to the cinema quite often in the past few weeks 
(11:26:40)<oeb>I have not seen there will be blood.
(11:26:42)<ido>think i've had enough for a while
(11:26:48)<ido>it's good
(11:27:03)<oeb>I go through phases of seeing movies. Had not been in about 6 months but saw 5 or six since xmas.
(11:27:17)<ido>yea i know what you mean
(11:27:40)<oeb>I Am Legend was quite good, it strayed a bit too much from the book though. By too much I mean it missed the point completley.
(11:27:43)<ido>although i don't think i often go 6 months between films
(11:27:52)<ido>it was ok
(11:28:02)<ido>didn't read the book though
(11:28:20)<oeb>Want me to spoil it? Or do you think you will read it?
(11:28:23)<ido>what was the point in the book?
(11:28:27)<ido>no i fon't 
(11:28:51)<oeb>Ok, first off in the book they were vampires rather than zombies.
(11:28:58)<ido>i have too many books in my queue to make room for a zombie apocalypse 
(11:29:23)<ido>does that make much of a difference? 
(11:29:28)<oeb>They came in two types, living vampires (Those who were alive when they got the illness) and dead ones (The already dead who rose)
(11:29:43)<oeb>Living vampires could speak and would taunt him.
(11:32:10)<oeb>In the book he was not a scientist, but an army vet who was bitten by a vampire bat many years before, hence his immunity
(11:32:35)<oeb>He went out every day and killed as many as he could, and holed up at night.
(11:33:12)<oeb>One day he finds this dog, there is a couple of chapters about his interaction with it. Very moving stuff. The dog dies.
(11:33:23)<oeb>Later he finds this woman, takes her home.
(11:33:49)<oeb>She claims to be a survivor, turns out apon a blood test that she is infected.
(11:34:45)<oeb>She reveals to him that she is part of a community of the 'living dead' people who are infected but have developed drugs to hold off the illness. They have no need to drink blood, they may go outside during the day for short periods etc.
(11:35:12)<oeb>He is a monster to them, he is the fearsome beast who kills them while they sleep.
(11:35:21)<ido>so in the book the living vampires are just normall people who need to drink blood?
(11:36:27)<oeb>There are two types, those who have succumed (They are insane etc, but can speak and show intelligence at a lower level) and the ones who are medicated who function as normall humans except for the need to sleep for at least part of the day.
(11:37:03)<oeb>When he discovers what he is and is captured by the new society, they imprision him and set him up for execution.
(11:37:07)<ido>and how do so many of them survive without the pray of normal people?
(11:37:35)<ido>do they eat one another?
(11:37:38)<oeb>The woman gives him the oppertunity to commit suicide with poision he takes them up on it.
(11:37:45)<oeb>Yes, they eat one another.
(11:38:09)<oeb>It's not explained in too much detail, but from time to time he sees them preying on one another.
(11:38:15)<oeb>Typically if one is injured.
(11:38:16)<ido>so actually their society is doomed regardless of what he does
(11:38:37)<oeb>Not really, the new society is very effeciant at killing vampires.
(11:38:57)<oeb>They do it at night when the vampires are out. He does it at day when they are asleep.
(11:38:58)<ido>newe society == the medicated vampires? 
(11:39:01)<oeb>yes
(11:39:32)<ido>but the vampires don't breed and have a limited supply of food
(11:39:39)<ido>eventually they will run out
(11:39:45)<oeb>For example when he is captured a group of 8 armed with pikes and guns easilly wipe out all the vampires outside the house.
(11:40:09)<oeb>That's not explained in too much detail, the book is set many many years after the outbreak though.
(11:40:50)<oeb>It's a short enough book, maybe 150 pages. You could read it in an afternoon easy. Well worth a read too.
(11:41:00)<ido>and can he tell the difference beteween the medicated vampires and the succmbed ones when they sleep?
(11:41:04)<oeb>No
(11:41:16)<oeb>The first he finds out about it is from the woman.
(11:42:38)<oeb>The only way he can tell if someone is infected or not is if they are out during the day. And the woman is the first one he sees outside (He does not know about the medication untill the very end).
(11:43:11)<oeb>So movie == he is a legend for curing it, book == he is a legend because he is the monster, when he thought he was the savior
(11:43:22)<ido>ok
(11:43:29)<oeb>So like I say, totally different point =P
(11:43:41)<ido>yea not really the same
(11:44:03)<oeb>It is a good book though, and like I say, nice and short, I would advise picking it up.
(11:44:35)<oeb>It's one of those 'One more chapter before I go to sleep book, Ohh shit, it's 2am already'
(11:44:43)<ido>why do people bother basing films on books when they don't keep the same story?
(11:45:22)<oeb>Well I think the Omega man, which was inspired by the book was closer to what was presented in the latest movie. Maybe it was based more on that.
(11:46:19)<oeb>There has been like 4 movie adaptations of this book. 'The last man on earth' was more faithful to the book apparently (Or so wikipedia tells me, not seen it myself)
(11:48:06)<ido>i have to go back to studying now :(
(06:18:57)<RotateMe>hey, could anybody point me to a decent c++ development enviroment for windows?
(06:27:46)<helge_>tried code blocks?
(06:29:35)<RotateMe>nope, will have a look, thx
(06:30:16)<RotateMe>looks cool
(06:30:34)<RotateMe>any experience/comparison to dev-c++ (that's the only one i know so far)
(06:36:41)<FledRebel>I use Microsoft Visual Studio for c++ dev on Windows
(06:39:26)<Glowie>Anything that compiles > Dev-Cpp
(06:39:39)<Glowie>As far as I know Dev-Cpp is outdated and.. Bad :P
(06:40:24)<Glowie>I use Visual Studio as well and haven't tried Code Blocks, but I'd try it first if I didn't have Visual Studio
(07:39:06)<RotateMe_away>k thx, Code::Blocks seems fine
(07:39:52)<RotateMe_away>can't get the doryen lib compiled there too but that might very well be because of my non existant c/++ skills
(07:55:59)<RotateMe>fuck that i managed to compile it!
(07:57:52)<Glowie>Yay for you :P

(05:03:27)<joe6pack>my parents are 63 and 67
(05:03:56)<RotateMe>that's still a few years difference that's right
(05:04:37)<RotateMe>tried to make some money by giving courses to elderly people showing them how to use pcs
(05:05:21)<joe6pack>did it work?
(05:05:29)<RotateMe>i made quite some money but most of them couldn't use it afterwards which was kind of depressing so i didn't do it once more
(05:05:42)<RotateMe>i felt a little bad even though i did everything i could
(05:05:58)<joe6pack>you should have advised them to take notes
(05:06:20)<joe6pack>or photocopy a page or 2 with the instructions you were teaching them
(05:06:41)<joe6pack>so that they will have a reference 
(05:07:20)<RotateMe>i did that but if there's the slightest difference on the paper compared to what they see on screen, they had problems
(05:07:39)<joe6pack>hmm
(05:07:43)<joe6pack>yea that sucks
(05:07:48)<joe6pack>i know what you mean
(05:08:02)<RotateMe>you can't really cover everything
(05:08:08)<joe6pack>i probably wouldn't want to do that either
(05:08:23)<joe6pack>maybe children, but not the elderly  
(05:08:35)<RotateMe>but i think there are techniques to teach them stuff like that but you need some real good tricks
(05:08:37)<joe6pack>children learn really fast 
(05:08:40)<RotateMe>yeah
(05:08:53)<joe6pack>you also need to invest a lot of time 
(05:09:06)<RotateMe>i also did the programming group at our school
(05:09:11)<RotateMe>that was fun
(05:09:31)<RotateMe>it was 20 people at the beginning and 18 were there every single time
(05:09:40)<RotateMe>even though it was voluntarily
(05:09:52)<joe6pack>nice
(05:09:58)<joe6pack>what did you teach them?
(05:10:14)<RotateMe>basic, they were all 5th graders
(05:10:30)<RotateMe>qbasic back then :D
(05:11:00)<RotateMe>quite a few started to do their own stuff, and i think most of them continued to get more knowledge
(05:11:05)<joe6pack>i was thought that in junior high
(05:11:15)<joe6pack>"taught" 
(05:11:24)<RotateMe>hmm junior high is from when to when again?
(05:11:35)<joe6pack>but i think i already knew everything the teacher was trying to teacj
(05:11:51)<joe6pack>7th-9th
(05:12:02)<RotateMe>:D that's often the case
(05:12:21)<joe6pack>i was taught logo in 4th grade though 
(05:13:04)<joe6pack>i think the primary school i went to was really quite good
(05:13:34)<RotateMe>my earliest "in-school" programming experience was in 9th grade, that's why i decided to teach (or rather help) some 5th graders
(05:13:38)<joe6pack>we were using email in '93 or '92
(05:14:00)<joe6pack>which was really not common at the time
(05:14:15)<RotateMe>wow, i don't think i even knew what internet was at that time :D
(05:14:19)<joe6pack>at least not in primary schools  
(05:14:43)<joe6pack>i don't think i knew either... i just know how to write and read emails
(05:14:57)<joe6pack>and play games when the teacher wasn't looking :p
(05:15:28)<joe6pack>i remember there were 2 computer classes
(05:15:44)<joe6pack>the good one with brand spanking new 386s
(05:15:51)<RotateMe>it's funny how i grew up when the internet grew up, but the first time i realized it, it was in a "finnished" state
(05:15:55)<joe6pack>and the old one with apple ]['s
(05:16:15)<joe6pack>i think you mean the web
(05:16:25)<joe6pack>the internet is quite a bit older than that
(05:16:33)<RotateMe>yeah
(05:16:38)<joe6pack>the web started in 91 or 92 iirc
(05:17:24)<joe6pack>were they apple]['s or c64's?
(05:17:26)<joe6pack>hrm
(05:17:30)<joe6pack>i'm not sure
(05:18:00)<RotateMe>i just remember my 386 i got in 1999 ^^
(05:18:16)<joe6pack>that's a bit late for a 386...
(05:18:30)<RotateMe>quite late, but without it i wouldn't have used qbasic probably
(05:18:43)<RotateMe>i couldn't play the games i wanted so i tried to make them myself
(05:18:55)<joe6pack>was the same for me
(05:19:05)<joe6pack>i had to use an old pc xt till 95 or so
(05:19:13)<RotateMe>didn't work and i kept being jealous of my friends with ther friggin pentiums playing diablo 
(05:19:38)<joe6pack>yea... only for it was the 386's and 486's playing dune 2
(05:19:46)<oeb>How I got into basic was those magazines that you used to be able to buy. 6 pages of the magazine was basicly a code listing for something like snake =P
(05:20:08)<RotateMe>cool, never saw those in shops...
(05:20:21)<joe6pack>a freind of mine from school hooked me on it
(05:20:38)<oeb>This was back in the 80s mind.
(05:20:48)<joe6pack>RotateMe: those were mostly to be found during the 8 bit era 
(05:20:54)<oeb>I must have been about 8 or 9 I think.
(05:20:58)<RotateMe>k that's a bit too early for me
(05:21:16)<RotateMe>a little bit ^^
(05:21:21)<joe6pack>for me too, i only started programming in the early 90's
(05:21:41)<RotateMe>i think basic is quite good to start with
(05:21:41)<joe6pack>and mostly in the mid 90's
(05:21:49)<joe6pack>yea i guess so
(05:21:54)<joe6pack>logo as well
(05:22:04)<joe6pack>they are both good for teaching you the basics
(05:22:12)<oeb>The first thing I properly wrote from scratch was a poor IF game in Pascal
(05:22:25)<joe6pack>and they suck enough so that you'd eventually have to learn another language 
(05:22:40)<oeb>It sucked though, I had a few pre-programmed accecptable responses, no real parser or anything.
(05:22:55)<joe6pack>heh
(05:23:08)<joe6pack>i was an IF fiend, only book form IF :)
(05:23:22)<RotateMe>i started with graphics right away... a tank wars (or better: gorrillas) rip-of
(05:23:35)<joe6pack>you know the books where it say "turn to page 69 if you want to fight the dragon"
(05:23:44)<RotateMe>ah i had some of those
(05:23:50)<oeb>Ohh yes, Choose your own adventure
(05:23:53)<joe6pack>i was addicted to them
(05:24:00)<joe6pack>yea that's what it's called 
(05:24:00)<RotateMe>they were pretty hard at times
(05:24:04)<oeb>By Jackson and that other guy, I must have had about 30 of them
(05:24:26)<RotateMe>there was a pretty cool series "Lone Wolf"
(05:24:42)<RotateMe>it must have had 30 books with a continuing story and a continuing hero
(05:24:47)<joe6pack>i think i read that one...
(05:24:59)<joe6pack>the name sounds really familiar 
(05:25:15)<oeb>I remember a great one that had spells and everything. You would be told a spell, for example FLURT might be fireball. Later on when the opertunity arose to use to use it you would get 4 or 5 words and would need to remember what each spell did.
(05:25:27)<oeb>I think there was a manticore on the cover.
(05:25:41)<joe6pack>it didn't take me long to go from that to d&d
(05:25:52)<RotateMe>some book had a troll skiing on the cover :D
(05:26:21)<joe6pack>i was also really obsessed with [a]d&d all through junior high and high school 
(05:26:51)<joe6pack>it's amazing how much time me and my friends spent on that crap
(05:27:31)<RotateMe>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_from_the_Dark
(05:27:47)<RotateMe>awesome, there's a wiki page for every single book he made :D
(05:28:09)<joe6pack>heh
(05:28:09)<RotateMe>i hope they aren't worth much, i sold all of them long ago for nothing
(05:29:45)<RotateMe>makes me want to play them again :D

(05:30:28)<RotateMe>the german covers are different it seams
(05:30:30)<RotateMe>:D
(05:30:35)<joe6pack>i never owned any. got them all from the local library 
(05:31:45)<joe6pack>which i've heard is being closed down 
(05:32:12)<joe6pack>it was a really small neighbourhood library 
(05:32:47)<joe6pack>the city is is supposidely trying to merge them all into 1 big library in the center of town
(07:03:03)<RotateMe>anyone knows a good and fast c++ tutorial?
(07:03:33)<RotateMe>given i know some c, c# and very little java
(07:09:01)<purestrain>uh, if you know c and c# there should be no problem
(07:10:00)<purestrain>encapsulate everything as objects and you're fine
(07:15:26)<Glowie>Just basically teach yourself how classes, strings and STL work
(07:17:21)<joe6pack>i was an IF fiend, only book form IF :)aren't strings already part of the stl?
(07:17:28)<joe6pack>damn
(07:17:37)<joe6pack>ignore the 1st part of the sentence 
(07:17:55)<joe6pack>i pressed the up arrow a couple of times apparently 
(07:18:43)<purestrain>they are
(07:20:44)<RotateMe>well there was emphasis on "some" ^^
(07:21:19)<RotateMe>basically i need to refresh everything since the last thing i made dates back 3 years and after looking through the doryen lib codes i realized that there's not too much left
(07:22:00)<RotateMe>but the tutorials i found are far too long, i need something compressed
(07:22:43)<Glowie>I just wanted to add more emphasis on strings by separating them from STL :P
(07:23:30)<joe6pack>RotateMe_wDog: just program in c + the bits of c++ you already know 
(08:14:22)<purestrain>hmmm
(08:15:13)<purestrain>should attaching weapons in hand be 'real' action s?
(08:19:06)<purestrain>hmm... i think they should
(10:16:39)<purestrain>i wonder if inventories in other roguelikes are more or less a 'sideeffect' or are really coded as an inventory
(10:18:22)<purestrain>perhaps i should study the source of some games
(10:21:04)<ido>what do you mean?
(10:27:10)<purestrain>i mean, do most roguelikes keep a list of inventory items for a character? for each item? or do they use a tree?
(10:27:48)<ido>what matter does it make if the underlying data structure is a tree or a linked list?
(10:28:47)<purestrain>i think a tree is easier to handle ;-)
(10:29:12)<purestrain>and its sideeffect is a inventory system
(10:29:28)<ido>i don't see how, but more importantly i  don't see why that matters
(10:29:53)<ido>and i think we are not talking about the same thing
(10:30:01)<purestrain>i was just asking what the traditionally way is
(10:31:04)<ido>tree as in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure
(10:31:06)<ido>?
(10:31:13)<purestrain>yes
(10:31:27)<ido>what are the nodes in such a tree? for example 
(10:31:41)<purestrain>player, weapon, portion and so on
(10:32:20)<ido>i think you have formulated your question very poorly  
(10:32:55)<purestrain>perhaps i could formulate it better, if i were more used in english language ;-)
(10:33:09)<ido>by "tree" did you mean to ask if the inventory is part of the player description?
(10:33:15)<ido>it has nothing to do with english
(10:33:36)<ido>you assume we all know the structure of your design 
(10:33:40)<ido>we do not :)
(10:34:27)<purestrain>well, with tree i mean that each entity is basically a node; if they are carried or not is describes by the parent
(10:34:35)<purestrain>the root in my example would be the world
(10:34:46)<ido>ok
(10:34:53)<ido>now i understand
(10:35:31)<ido>i don't know about a "traditional" way of doing it, but:
(10:35:35)<ido>1. my games
(10:35:39)<ido>2. angband
(10:35:46)<ido>3. advanced rogue
(10:35:53)<ido>do not do it that wawy
(10:36:09)<ido>(i think, i haven't looked at all the sources of 2&3)
(10:36:34)<ido>i.e. an inventory is implemented as an inventory 
(10:36:46)<purestrain>so how do they handle relations between objects? just a linked list as inventory ?
(10:37:00)<ido>i don't know
(10:37:55)<ido>(doesn't have to be a linked list btw, that is an implementation detail) 
(10:38:16)<purestrain>of course, i mean a seperate collection/array/whatever
(10:39:53)<ido>i don't know, but i can guess that a "combined" object (like dagger + poison) is transformed to a new object (poisoned dagger) in the inventory
(10:40:21)<purestrain>ah, ok
(10:40:22)<ido>and "ingredients" (dagger, poison) are then deleted 
(10:43:25)<ido>http://www.theonion.com/content/video/in_the_know_how_can_we_make_the
(11:35:21)<ido>can any of you access ted.com?
(11:38:40)<ido>gary gygax is dead
(11:41:02)<jraregris>wow
(11:41:08)<jraregris>just now?

(04:56:44)<oeb>My dad is going through his mid life crisis atm, he bought a mazda 6 a few months back. Lovely car to drive
(04:57:35)<ido>supposidly subarus are as well
(04:57:53)<oeb>Yes, I prefer the mazdas though.
(04:58:17)<oeb>One of his friends (Also going through a mid life crisis) bought a subaru.
(04:58:22)<ido>i don't even have a driver's licence 
(04:58:28)<oeb>Although worst of all his friends is Bernard.
(04:58:34)<ido>porsche?
(04:58:43)<oeb>Bernard bought a porsche in November.
(04:58:48)<ido>hah
(04:58:57)<oeb>I have no idea what model it was, all I know is VRT was 150,000
(04:59:07)<ido>the worst ones always go for the porsche
(04:59:26)<oeb>In Ireland VRT has to be paid on all cars imported into the country. It's 25% of the cars current market value.
(04:59:41)<oeb>That means he paid AT LEAST 750,000 euro on the car.
(04:59:48)<ido>vrt? is that like value added tax?
(04:59:59)<oeb>No, Vehicle Registration Tax
(05:00:06)<oeb>It's paid when you import a car.
(05:00:24)<oeb>Can you imagine having so much money you can spend three quaters of a million on a car?
(05:00:25)<ido>so how much are all the taxes on a car combined? 
(05:00:43)<oeb>I dont think you pay VAT on an imported car.
(05:00:55)<oeb>VRT is just Irelands excuse to make some money out of it.
(05:01:01)<ido>you mean self imported? 
(05:01:04)<oeb>You pay VAT on a new car (21%)
(05:01:07)<oeb>Yes.
(05:01:12)<ido>so that's not too bad
(05:01:21)<ido>only 4% more than normal
(05:01:32)<oeb>Not really, because it's charged on the current market value too.
(05:01:42)<ido>unless you have to pay the vat in the country you bought it in as well...
(05:01:47)<ido>so that's 21% more 
(05:02:23)<oeb>For example if you bring a car that would have oridginally been worth 10,000 , but has had 20,000 worth of work done to it, you only pay the VRT off the base price. So that would be 2,500 euro
(05:02:32)<oeb>Even though you could sell it for 30,000
(05:03:11)<oeb>Alot of people import cars to Ireland. It is cheaper than buying them here mostly. The UK is much cheaper for second hand cars than Ireland.
(05:04:12)<ido>but that tax rate isn't too bad. a lot of countries (especially in continental europe) have much higher taxes on cars
(05:05:01)<ido>750,000 euros for a car is still insane 
(05:05:15)<ido>i didn't even know you could pay so much for a car
(05:05:46)<ido>unless it's some antique Rolls Royce or something 
(05:06:16)<oeb>Heh, there are more expensive cars =P
(05:06:18)<ido>i thought a new porsche is maybe 200,000 euro
(05:06:36)<oeb>Ohh some are, but this would be nearly top of the line porsche
(05:06:48)<ido>crazy
(05:07:14)<oeb>There might be three or four models of porsche available at each time, one will normally be 'cheap' at about the 100,000 mark.
(05:08:27)<ido>that makes your father's mazda seem down right frugal
(05:09:34)<oeb>Yup
(05:09:47)<oeb>I think a new mazda 6 is about 20,000
(05:10:02)<oeb>A new RX-8 is 35-40 I think
(05:10:17)<oeb>Actually a new mazda-6 would be closer to 30
(05:10:22)<oeb>(I think)

(07:00:35)<RotateMe>the woodmachine is awesome ^^
(07:00:57)<RotateMe>just sent a mail to one of my teachers, forcing him to build this for our next class

(01:26:39)<Polaris>hello
(01:28:51)<Polaris>do someone have sometimes for noobish question about rogue like world?
(01:34:22)<makke>depends on the question :)
(01:37:19)<makke>I am not really a roguelike veteran myself
(01:41:50)<RotateMe_away>just ask ^^
(01:56:44)<Polaris>is the news group about roguelike dev and other is not online anymore?
(01:57:48)<Polaris>mean when i retrieve the mail from the news group with my thunderbird the message date stop in 2006...
(01:58:07)<Polaris>and sorry for my bad english i am french...
(02:02:22)<RotateMe>no the rgrd newsgroup is still on and very active
(02:02:39)<RotateMe>i think the provider you get your news from doesn't have the group somehow anymore
(02:03:03)<RotateMe>you can use google groups if you are fine with it
(02:03:15)<RotateMe>http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.development/topics
(02:03:22)<RotateMe>hope this helped i got to go
(02:03:33)<RotateMe>hope you will check by more often!
(02:11:16)<Polaris>ok rotate to late for thanks but thanks anyway
(02:45:27)<Polaris>good night people!

(09:16:54)<deveah>Moldova = 80% romanian ; 20% russian
(09:20:23)<TMC>cool
(10:32:30)<TMC>can anyone name any games with random floor plans?
(10:32:40)<TMC>I mean, random maps without space between rooms
(10:33:01)<TMC>seems harder to create

(01:17:32)<RotateMe>hi joe/ido
(01:17:36)<joe6pack>hi RotateMe 
(01:17:39)<RotateMe>who's running the bot atm?
(01:17:42)<joe6pack>i am
(01:17:54)<RotateMe>could you send me the current logfile?
(01:17:55)<joe6pack>but i am not developing it 
(01:18:02)<joe6pack>i will commit it to svn
(01:18:16)<RotateMe>k
(01:18:19)<joe6pack>should i stop it?
(01:18:25)<joe6pack>do you want to run it?
(01:18:54)<RotateMe>no not really, just want the logs
(01:19:02)<joe6pack>k
(01:19:33)<joe6pack>you can take it from http://yehieli.info/rgrd/log.txt
(01:19:54)<joe6pack>it is updated automatically 
(01:20:09)<joe6pack>i run the bot on the same computer as the web serve 
(01:20:10)<joe6pack>r
(01:20:51)<RotateMe>that's pretty cool actually
(01:21:26)<joe6pack>i try to keep that computer on as often as possible 
(01:22:51)<joe6pack>but sometimes the noise from the fan drives me insane when it's otherwise really quiet
(01:23:25)<RotateMe>yeah i know that problem
(01:23:29)<joe6pack>so it is not online 100% of the time 
(01:23:43)<RotateMe>my laptop is VERY quiet but my external hd is loud as shit compared to that
(01:25:16)<joe6pack>deveah's mp3 sounds more alien than horror-esque 
(01:25:26)<RotateMe>i like it somehow
(01:25:31)<joe6pack>yes it's nice
(01:25:53)<RotateMe>the beginning sounds very snes final fantasy like
(01:26:00)<joe6pack>i should try to make a living out of indie game development 
(01:26:09)<joe6pack>i woukld need graphics for that though
(01:26:31)<joe6pack>maybe sell it through something like steam 
(01:26:33)<RotateMe>after that it reminds me of the tune of seizure dome: http://cactusquid.proboards99.com/index.cgi?board=games&action=display&thread=20
(01:27:02)<RotateMe>well the good olde graphics problem...
(01:27:10)<joe6pack>and sound as well
(01:27:30)<joe6pack>i will have to pay someone to create gfx and another one to create sfx/music
(01:27:44)<RotateMe>sound is not as much of a problem
(01:27:44)<joe6pack>but i think it is doable 
(01:27:53)<joe6pack>only not very profitable...
(01:27:55)<RotateMe>sfx can be created by cool freeware progs
(01:28:08)<RotateMe>for music you just have to know some people
(01:28:14)<joe6pack>gfx as well, but if you want good quality it's something else
(01:28:27)<joe6pack>you can say the same about gfx
(01:28:53)<RotateMe>yeah but gfx people that make graphics that can be taken for games are rare
(01:29:23)<joe6pack>and you think people that'll create good music for free aren't?
(01:29:31)<joe6pack>seems the same to me 
(01:29:48)<joe6pack>especially if you want to sell the game
(01:29:58)<RotateMe>hmm i have three real friends who make electronical music that could be included in games
(01:30:08)<joe6pack>hrm
(01:30:29)<RotateMe>look through myspace or some mod archives
(01:30:55)<RotateMe>ask the people if it's okay if their music will be included in your game if you pay them like a few percent
(01:31:19)<RotateMe>the problem with graphics is, that they are created FOR a game, and after used once they loose their integrity
(01:32:15)<RotateMe>btw if you have a game that is in need of music i can provide you some tracks
(01:32:16)<joe6pack>yea
(01:32:30)<RotateMe>depending on the style of your game of course
(01:32:47)<joe6pack>anyway
(01:32:58)<joe6pack>i won't do anything commercial anytime soon
(01:33:02)<joe6pack>if at all
(01:33:24)<joe6pack>i think the chances of actually maki ng enough money to live off of it are slim
(01:33:33)<RotateMe>yeah very slim
(01:33:45)<RotateMe>but depends on in which country you are living
(01:34:00)<joe6pack>maybe i can save up some money and try it sometime for a year or so
(01:34:02)<joe6pack>austria
(01:34:25)<joe6pack>and sometimes in israel, which is not much cheaper than austria 
(01:34:59)<joe6pack>i would say the cost of living in israel is maybe somewhere between western germany and eastern germany 
(01:35:06)<joe6pack>maybe a bit closer to eastern germany
(01:35:27)<joe6pack>but it is getting more expensive all the time
(01:35:45)<joe6pack>i think soon it will be as expensive as everywhere in western europe 
(01:35:56)<RotateMe>yeah i'm moving to eastern germany because of that :D
(01:36:08)<RotateMe>well the main reason is that there's a good university for math
(01:36:26)<joe6pack>i've heard berlin is an awsome city to be a student in
(01:36:40)<joe6pack>cheap & a lot of culture and stuff to do
(01:36:46)<RotateMe>that's where i'm going :D
(01:36:48)<RotateMe>eastern part
(01:36:58)<RotateMe>or better northern part which is in east germany
(01:37:12)<joe6pack>yea that should be considerably cheaper than where you are now 
(01:37:17)<RotateMe>there's not this division anymore of course but there still are price differences
(01:37:23)<RotateMe>yes
(01:37:33)<joe6pack>there is a very big price difference, i would say
(01:37:57)<joe6pack>Munich and Frankfurt are more expensive than Vienna 
(01:38:17)<RotateMe>and munich sucks on top of that ;)
(01:38:19)<RotateMe>http://home.arcor.de/dungeonhunter/tracks/
(01:38:33)<joe6pack>really? i was there once as a turist and it seemed ok
(01:38:33)<RotateMe>uploaded three tracks a friend made for an arena shooter i wanted to do
(01:38:43)<joe6pack>just a normal city 
(01:39:05)<RotateMe>yeah just some not-so-nice things happened there, i think it's okay in the end
(01:39:08)<joe6pack>i've found Munich to very similar to Vienna 
(01:39:15)<RotateMe>i was there at the october fest
(01:40:19)<joe6pack>if you mean the nazis, that's everywhere in germany and austria. i don't think that today you would find more neo nazis in munich than the rest of germany 
(01:41:15)<joe6pack>everywhere else in Bavaria, maybe... but Munich is fairly liberal from what i've seen 
(01:41:22)<RotateMe>yeah but it's a whole other mentality towards them in different parts of the country
(01:41:57)<joe6pack>Munich and Vienna are islands of liberalism in the vast sea of conservatism that is Bavaria and Austria 
(01:42:39)<RotateMe>yeah that was my impression too... i have been in whole other parts of bavaria
(01:42:59)<RotateMe>but that was more funny than dangerous or sad :D
(01:43:18)<joe6pack>yes but these 2 cities in particular are good. they are totally different than their surroundings 
(01:43:20)<RotateMe>some stereotypes are just closer to reality then one might think ;)
(01:43:40)<joe6pack>:)
(01:43:53)<joe6pack>stereotypes are there for a reason ;0
(01:44:02)<joe6pack>often they are at least partially true 
(01:48:05)<RotateMe>i have been messing around with the doryen engine recently and i have to say it's pretty awesome
(01:48:27)<RotateMe>i will use this for my 7drl
(01:48:30)<RotateMe>oh btw
(01:48:32)<RotateMe>wtf
(01:48:36)<RotateMe>it started :D
(01:48:51)<joe6pack>:0
(01:48:54)<joe6pack>good luck
(01:48:54)<RotateMe>well i will not start before 20th of march but gotta look at rgrd
(01:49:07)<joe6pack>i gotta study for my exam
(01:49:15)<joe6pack>differential equations...
(01:49:37)<joe6pack>at least it's easier than universal algebra or measure theory :p
(01:49:50)<joe6pack>i think i will actually do ok in this one
(01:49:54)<joe6pack>bye
(01:51:02)<RotateMe>whoot that's more 7drls than i tought...
(02:00:10)<TMC>variable width AND height bitmapped font?
(02:00:12)<TMC>wtf?
(02:00:42)<RotateMe>wat
(02:00:59)<RotateMe>libtcod?
(02:01:04)<TMC>no
(02:01:33)<RotateMe>hmm... what else then?
(02:01:45)<TMC>reading the patch instructions (mentions the obstacles they encountered) for Shiren the Wanderer
(02:02:04)<TMC>psst
(02:02:08)<TMC>[22:39] <TMC> can anyone name any games with random floor plans?
(02:02:08)<TMC>[22:39] <TMC> I mean, random maps without space between rooms
(02:02:08)<TMC>[22:39] <TMC> seems harder to create
(02:03:00)<TMC>I'm thinking of starting by generating the building shape, then dividing that into different areas
(02:03:56)<TMC>eg, if it's a castle maybe sleeping quarters, kitchen, halls, living areas, battlements
(02:04:14)<RotateMe>hmmm you could do it like this: http://jice.nospam.googlepages.com/basicdungeongeneration
(02:04:22)<TMC>and then somehow dividing those areas into rooms
(02:04:39)<TMC>.nospam. ?
(02:04:47)<RotateMe>just like that...
(02:04:52)<RotateMe>dunno :D
(02:05:09)<TMC>ah thanks
(02:05:14)<TMC>that is appropriate
(02:05:14)<RotateMe>Shiren is a great game btw
(02:05:21)<TMC>which one?
(02:05:28)<TMC>I understand it's a series
(02:05:41)<RotateMe>yeah, just the last few steps are different if you want to have no space between the rooms
(02:05:55)<RotateMe>the second i guess? don't really know... "the wanderer"
(02:05:56)<RotateMe>for snes
(02:06:16)<RotateMe>when you die you keep stuff in a warehouse and triggered events keep being triggered
(02:06:19)<RotateMe>very cool idea
(02:06:32)<TMC>triggered events?
(02:06:47)<TMC>you mean, one time events reoccur after you've died?
(02:07:27)<RotateMe>things happen in the town and if you come there another time (after dieing once) those things continue instead of repead
(02:08:16)<TMC>ah
(04:54:49)<joe6pack>hi
(04:55:25)<joe6pack>anyone remember that small proof of concept rl with the maps that have no floors?
(04:55:47)<joe6pack>you would go from higher levels to lower ones in a continuous way 
(04:55:56)<joe6pack>i don't know how i can describe it any better
(04:57:48)<Glowie>I do
(04:57:59)<joe6pack>it was really neat
(04:58:04)<Glowie>Yup
(04:59:57)<joe6pack>do you havwe a link?
(05:02:11)<joe6pack>found it 
(05:02:20)<joe6pack>http://sourceforge.net/projects/yakamura-legacy
(05:02:25)<joe6pack>think it was this one
(05:02:26)<Glowie>Yep
(05:02:28)<joe6pack>it's a good idea
(05:02:34)<joe6pack>maybe i should use it next time
(05:03:45)<joe6pack>i've gathered a couple of these cute ideas that i might one day implement in a small game
(05:04:51)<joe6pack>another one is the facing-los/stealth idea i implemented in caverover a year and a half ago
(05:05:33)<joe6pack>when i think about it, caverover was actually more feature complete than cryprover, but it was further from being a full game
(05:05:51)<joe6pack>the core concept was not as small as cryptrover's
(05:06:48)<joe6pack>what else? hmm
(05:07:11)<joe6pack>there was another idea i remember wanting to steal from a 7drl i played recently 
(05:18:39)<RotateMe>:( linux only
(07:10:17)<purestrain>i'm not very motivated in actually programming today :-(
(07:30:38)<RotateMe>when i am like this but something needs to be done, i just start and after some time i get so into some pieces of code that motivation comes from itself
(07:36:22)<Glowie>Woah I'm not the only one who does that o_o
(07:36:31)<Glowie>Though most of the time when I don't feel like coding I just play something
(07:47:00)<ido>Glowie: not wanting to code is the best motivation to learn for an exam :p
(07:47:13)<Glowie>Haha
(07:47:49)<ido>that's why doing a lot programming for a few weeks before the exams start is a good thing
(07:48:50)<Glowie>I can find motivation for studying at any time though
(07:48:58)<ido>really?
(07:49:09)<ido>that's good
(07:50:23)<purestrain>30 minutes to go... i think i'll read some roguebasin articles :-)
(07:50:26)<ido>i think it helps if you're studying for something easy. buty studying for a sunbject you know nothing about and having to go through a really painful learning experience at the beginning is really difficult 
(07:50:37)<Glowie>Yup, I guess it's a bit strange as 99% of people I know can't do this :P
(07:50:57)<ido>of course, 
(07:51:11)<ido>it also helps if you are interested in the subject at hand
(07:51:12)<ido>;)
(07:51:40)<ido>after many years of studying i am only continuing because i want to finish it, not because of interest 
(07:51:48)<Glowie>Hehe
(07:51:51)<Glowie>Works too
(07:51:55)<Glowie>What are you studying?
(07:52:08)<ido>M.Sc. in mathematics 
(07:52:37)<Glowie>Maths for the win \o/
(07:53:00)<ido>i kind of got sucked into the master's program before finishing the bachelor's 
(07:53:14)<Glowie>How?
(07:53:35)<ido>until recently in austria there was just a 5 year program, at the end of which you get an M.Sc.
(07:54:06)<ido>the seperation of a 3 years B.Sc. program + 2 years M.Sc. is realatively new here
(07:54:19)<ido>and i am still in the old program
(07:54:40)<ido>and if i switch now i will lose all the progress i've made after the bachelor's part
(07:54:49)<ido>so i just keep on going.
(07:55:07)<ido>hopefully soon enough i will be done with all the courses
(07:55:09)<Glowie>Ah, that sucks for people who would be satisfied with bachelor's :(
(07:55:26)<ido>then i will only have to write my thesis 
(07:55:27)<ido>yes
(07:55:39)<Glowie>Write about calculus, calculus rocks \o/
(07:55:46)<Glowie>Integrals and derivatives for the win
(07:56:11)<ido>on the other hand, it motivates you to continue studying. otherwise you would get nothing, no bachelor's and no master's 
(07:56:24)<ido>not really my area of interest 
(07:56:37)<ido>i like game theory. number theory is also neat
(07:56:47)<Glowie>Game theory in maths?
(07:56:50)<ido>yes
(07:56:55)<Glowie>Didn't know that was a part of maths
(07:56:55)<ido>that's where it came from
(07:57:00)<Glowie>Neat
(07:57:15)<ido>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory
(07:57:28)<Glowie>(I love calculus and analytic geometry)
(07:57:30)<ido>"Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics which is used in the social sciences..."
(07:57:47)<ido>it's in the very 1st sentence :p
(07:58:18)<ido>i've had enough of it all. i want to get it over with
(07:58:33)<ido>and then do nothing. although i will probably need to fins a job again
(07:58:34)<Glowie>Hehe
(07:58:35)<ido>:(
(07:58:42)<Glowie>That's life
(07:59:35)<ido>at least i will have a nice diploma for my mother to be proud of 
(07:59:53)<Glowie>Hehe
(08:00:39)<ido>my parents are going to china!
(08:00:48)<ido>decided just like that
(08:00:53)<ido>told me about it yesterday
(08:01:17)<Glowie>On a vacation? Or to live there?
(08:01:21)<ido>vacation 
(08:01:32)<ido>they are not that adventures 
(08:01:34)<Glowie>I'd rather go to Japan :P
(08:01:44)<Glowie>Or perhaps South Korea
(08:01:49)<ido>they have been to japan several times already 
(08:01:59)<Glowie>Oh
(08:02:01)<Glowie>Veterans :P
(08:02:04)<ido>as well as hong kong and tailand 
(08:02:14)<ido>but never to mainland china
(08:02:41)<ido>my father has also been to Taiwan 
(08:03:15)<ido>what would you do in south korea?
(08:03:18)<ido>play starcraft?
(08:03:35)<Glowie>Yup ^_^
(08:03:41)<Glowie>And watch it there
(08:03:48)<ido>all of the korean girls i've met have been really cute
(08:03:54)<Glowie>Haha

(02:43:13)<RotateMe>gngiht!
(09:28:31)<deveah>what happened to ido?
(11:06:54)<purestrain>i'm proud of my zombies... they are so dumb that they block each other
(11:08:27)<deveah>my zombies get over each other making a big spit on the screen
(11:08:42)<deveah>if zombiex<playerx then zombiex+=1 ...
(11:11:56)<deveah>how do you move in japaneselegacy?
(03:10:31)<deveah>how dumb can you be to byt a psp when there aren't any games for it????
(03:26:20)<RotateMe>what are you talking about
(03:26:52)<RotateMe>aside from millions of snes, psone, nes, whatnot perfectly emulated games there are lots of good games especially for psp
(03:27:05)<RotateMe>and then there's nethack, angband and POWDER
(03:28:19)<deveah>yes, but not in Romania
(03:36:02)<RotateMe>well you can get them everywhere via bit torrent :D
(03:36:19)<RotateMe>but therefore you'd need a 1.5 firmware or some custom firmware
(03:40:42)<Aerton>add zx-spectrum emulator and dosbox
(04:07:31)<deveah>the kid i'm talking about is a darn retard
(04:20:34)<jraregris>because he bought a psp?
(04:20:39)<deveah>RotateMe, you can get them, but how do you put them on the real machine?
(04:21:09)<deveah>no, because he buys all the shit and then realises he shouldn't have bought it
(04:32:10)<RotateMe>deveah, usb connection?
(04:32:35)<RotateMe>my memory card is capable of about 8 games at a time and lots of other stuff
(04:34:27)<deveah>oh
(04:34:29)<deveah>greaty then
(04:34:41)<deveah>how much does the battery last? do you have Flash on it?
(04:35:00)<deveah>adobe flash ofcourse
(04:35:14)<RotateMe>don't know, but i don't think so
(04:35:25)<RotateMe>battery lasts about 4 hours or so
(04:35:40)<deveah>0.o too little - i want an n-gage now
(04:35:40)<RotateMe>i rarely play without being able to reload

(04:38:59)<RotateMe>i didn't try it ... but it's nice to have it :D
(04:39:08)<RotateMe>gotta get back to financial accounting
(04:39:17)<RotateMe>will be a hell of an exam tomorrow :(
(04:39:18)<deveah>but how about the nds? does it have usb cables?
(04:40:07)<RotateMe>i believe not but it sure has some hot games
(04:40:16)<RotateMe>izuna sounds like a good rl
(04:40:23)<RotateMe>bit like shiren

(05:38:54)<RotateMe>90% of my log consists of you joining, quitting and renaming ^^
(05:46:04)<ido>a lot of activity in the newsgruop in the past couple of days
(05:46:13)<ido>more 7drl's than i expected
(05:46:35)<deveah>idoooo!
(05:46:42)<ido>i think there are 17?
(05:46:45)<ido>hi deveah 
(05:47:09)<ido>nice song, btw
(05:47:23)<deveah>i wish they would all make it
(05:47:24)<ido>although i thought it sounded more alien than horror 
(05:47:39)<ido>if half of them will it will be good
(05:47:47)<deveah>thanks - 8bit lo-fi tracked
(05:48:09)<ido>i have to go back to learning for my exam in 2 days
(05:48:17)<ido>have a nice weekend 
(05:48:19)<deveah>exam for...
(05:48:30)<ido>differential equations 
(05:48:40)<deveah>maths then
(05:48:44)<ido>yes
(05:48:46)<deveah>i never learned anything for maths
(05:48:55)<ido>all of my exams are in mathematics 
(05:49:03)<RotateMe>17!? that's awesome
(05:49:09)<RotateMe>is anyone in here doing one?
(05:49:17)<ido>from what i've counted anyway
(05:49:28)<deveah>i never learn for romanian language and yet, i get 9 and 10 marks!
(05:49:43)<ido>these were the number of posts with 7drl in the subject line fromn the past couple of days
(05:50:03)<ido>well wait until university, is all i've got to say ;)
(05:50:22)<ido>i never learned for exams when i was your age either
(05:51:09)<deveah>cya, got homework
(06:16:34)<purestrain>yehaw, random map generation works !
(09:13:46)<joe6pack>makke, what's up?
(09:13:59)<joe6pack>why do you keep leaving and rejoining? 
(09:14:08)<makke>coz my sound system is fubared
(10:16:09)<RotateMe>EezT/DaEezT is doing that the whole day so it's okay makke ^^
(10:28:27)<purestrain>ah, today was a great day
(10:28:40)<joe6pack>in what respect? 
(10:28:47)<purestrain>coding
(10:28:57)<joe6pack>:)
(10:29:04)<purestrain>the drawback is, everything gets more and more spaghetti like
(10:29:11)<joe6pack>huh
(10:29:16)<joe6pack>how much code do you have?
(10:29:21)<joe6pack>in terms of loc
(10:29:43)<purestrain>don't know, i have no tool to count lines
(10:29:55)<joe6pack>sclc 
(10:30:03)<joe6pack>and a ton of other free ones
(10:30:34)<joe6pack>you have to actively try to write less code. 
(10:30:46)<joe6pack>a small code base doesn't happen by itself
(10:31:31)<joe6pack>there's a lot of code i could have written in half the time or less if i didn't care about writing as little as possible 
(10:32:17)<joe6pack>but it helps you later on in maintenance or if you want to reuse some of your code
(10:32:20)<purestrain>yeah; but i want to get finished, so i'm ending in many hacks :-(
(10:32:29)<joe6pack>fair enough
(10:34:09)<joe6pack>Je n'ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n'ai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus courte.
(10:34:15)<purestrain>and for the first day i got really far i think. Actions/Movement, Map generation  (almost, some minor glitches) and a simple combat system works
(10:34:18)<joe6pack>--Blaise Pascal
(10:34:33)<joe6pack>good :)
(10:34:37)<joe6pack>keep going 
(10:35:32)<joe6pack>"I have made this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to make it shorter."
(10:36:06)<joe6pack>one of my favorite quotes; i can really identify with it 
(10:36:45)<purestrain>should slow moving monsters react to nearby enemies? i've currently the problem that a very slow moving monster does not react if i'm dancing around it
(10:37:25)<joe6pack>what doese speed have to do with it
(10:37:27)<joe6pack>?
(10:38:01)<purestrain>because if a movement from one tile to another takes 200 turns, and my movement takes 20 turns, i can walk around it
(10:38:16)<purestrain>and its only thinking after the movement
(10:38:36)<joe6pack>so it doesn't get the chance to move?
(10:38:48)<joe6pack>because you are already away by the time it does?
(10:39:13)<purestrain>yes.. my monster is walking up to me for 200 turns and react only if the movement is finished
(10:39:50)<joe6pack>i thogut moving to you is its reaction 
(10:40:31)<purestrain>yes, but for the next 200 time units. So i can turn around it if i'm much faster without any damage
(10:40:52)<purestrain>nice english i am talking, yoda like
(10:41:08)<joe6pack>but isn't that what's it's supposed to be like?
(10:41:50)<purestrain>perhaps.... but why should i fear a really powerfull slow moving monster, if i can chase, make a hit, and leave without any reactions ?
(10:41:55)<joe6pack>i think yoda-like would be "so around it to turn, i can"
(10:42:24)<joe6pack>then make the monster faster ;)
(10:43:07)<joe6pack>any change you make would effectively make the mosnter faster, if i understood you correctly 
(10:43:51)<purestrain>but if i make it faster, its no more the 'slow moving deady creature from hell'
(10:44:27)<joe6pack>moving 50% slower than you are is already very slow
(10:44:47)<purestrain>uh; i made it almost 10% :-)
(10:45:03)<joe6pack>that's what i am saying. it sounds way too exaggerated 
(10:45:17)<purestrain>yeah; i'm thinking about it
(10:46:07)<joe6pack>look at existing games. in crawl i think the slowest monster is that worm one, which is i think still a bit more than 50% the player's speed
(10:46:55)<joe6pack>i know from my expereince, that making the arachnids in cryptrover 66% the speed of the player made them very noticebly slower 
(10:49:12)<joe6pack>i would say, don't worry about it now; finish a preliminary version of the game, and if it's too slow or too fast the players will tell you about it very quickly 
(10:49:34)<joe6pack>balance can come after all the basics are done
(10:49:52)<purestrain>you're right.. it would be to time consuming if i check every bit for balance
(10:50:11)<purestrain>perhaps it doesn't even make fun and time was wasted for balance ;-)
(10:50:20)<joe6pack>right
(10:50:50)<joe6pack>or maybe the game would still be too difficult and you end up undoing these balance changes 
(10:51:17)<joe6pack>you can't tell if it's too difficult or too easy before it's playable 
(11:24:24)<purestrain>almost midnight

(08:05:40)<purestrain>hua; nice bug... i can take doors
(08:06:05)<purestrain>thats makes the game a little bit strategic.. picking up doors and placing them anywhere
(08:07:00)<joe6pack>hey,
(08:07:04)<purestrain>huh.... that also means i can pick monsters
(08:07:10)<joe6pack>that's actually not a bad idea

(08:07:38)<Gamer2k4>7DRL discussion?
(08:07:41)<purestrain>yeah, thats what i intended... but not monsters and doors :-)
(08:08:01)<joe6pack>you can do something like that boulder pushing game
(08:08:04)<joe6pack>what's it called
(08:08:07)<purestrain>pushing obstacles, carrying chairs in front of a door
(08:08:19)<Gamer2k4>sokoban?
(08:08:23)<joe6pack>yes
(08:09:12)<joe6pack>or boulder dash
(08:11:55)<RotateMe>can you only pickup doors while they are opened?
(08:12:15)<RotateMe>and how do you pickup monsters, or can you somehow move on the same field they are?
(08:12:21)<purestrain>i can take them all the time.. but that was not intended
(08:12:37)<RotateMe>but damn... picking up monsters that's a great idea!!!
(08:12:38)<purestrain>pressing P ? after that i show a popup with all entities in range
(08:12:50)<RotateMe>oh damn it's already done ... pokemon :(
(08:12:55)<RotateMe>ah okay
(08:13:12)<RotateMe>thought it was the classical g pickup
(08:13:27)<purestrain>uh... g; p... whatever ;-)
(08:13:38)<Glowie>, is the pick up key
(08:13:39)<Glowie>Always :<
(08:15:01)<Gamer2k4>I thought it would be nifty to treat unconscious monsters as items in my main project

(08:16:17)<Gamer2k4>treated as in your pack, with get and drop and all
(08:16:24)<joe6pack>i was wondering what happens when your hobbit rogue tries to out that unconscious mutalisk in his back pack 
(08:16:38)<Gamer2k4>heh
(08:17:11)<joe6pack>speaking of mutalisks 
(08:17:20)<Gamer2k4>it would be a sort of quest thing..."take the -foo- prisoner" or something

(08:19:21)<joe6pack>your code is starting to spaghettyfy? 
(08:19:27)<purestrain>instead of asking "what can i do with you, entity" i'm hardcoding (if class=door then action=open )

(08:20:13)<Gamer2k4>what project are you working on?
(08:20:24)<joe6pack>his 7drl iirc

(08:47:31)<RotateMe>and now it is already there
(08:47:37)<RotateMe>pretty cool story
(09:02:19)<joe6pack>RotateMe: actually it's already off...
(09:02:32)<joe6pack>there is a new lotd

(09:46:08)<joe6pack>nice!
(09:46:58)<Epyon|BURNOUT>This looks like AliensRL graphical version O.o
(09:47:45)<purestrain>mainly because the corridor cross? ;-0
(09:47:59)<Epyon|BURNOUT>hmm, I guess
(09:48:29)<purestrain>yeah; but that cross is rather random... i divided the map into 6x6 parts, and made corridors randomly around the parts
(09:48:48)<purestrain>itself the rooms use subdividing, just like aliens rl
(09:51:36)<purestrain>http://retroforge.de/%7Emd/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/map.png <- here is an example map

(05:09:27)<RotateMe>why are there so many articles on erlang in the last few dasy?
(05:09:30)<RotateMe>*days
(05:09:43)<joe6pack>days?
(05:09:50)<joe6pack>i would say months
(05:10:32)<joe6pack>erlang&haskell are the cool languages atm
(05:12:08)<RotateMe>hm and erlang is really the thing the wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29) is about?
(05:12:14)<RotateMe>doesn't sound cool at all :D
(05:12:20)<joe6pack>they have been replacing ruby and python as the fashionable languages for maybe a year already
(05:12:55)<joe6pack>i don't know, i have programmed in neither erlang nor haskell
(05:13:01)<RotateMe>k
(05:13:12)<RotateMe>abap is teh coolest anyway :P
(05:22:03)<RotateMe>this looks pretty nice http://www.jjj.de/fxt/#fxtbook
(05:22:13)<RotateMe>(the book at near bottom)
(05:24:57)<joe6pack>oh man
(05:25:04)<joe6pack>the new firefox is nice 
(05:25:19)<joe6pack>first time i try ff3
(05:29:34)<RotateMe>dling right now
(05:36:01)<deveah>hello
(05:36:32)<deveah>what's the rl-in-the-challenge status?
(05:36:50)<joe6pack>you mean how many?
(05:49:46)<joe6pack>should i show the last known position of unseen enemies?
(05:50:26)<joe6pack>figured i'll take another look at the cryptrover source after now that  my exams are over
(05:54:59)<deveah>oh, did you get the results yet?
(05:55:11)<joe6pack>i just took it now
(05:55:25)<deveah>was it *hard* ?
(05:55:34)<joe6pack>it will take several weeks, knowing how this professor is
(05:55:52)<joe6pack>yes, somewhat hard
(05:56:16)<deveah>i'll remake the RoRLE for fast console-output
(05:56:42)<deveah>it'll refresh everything on the fov only
(05:56:51)<deveah>oh bad idea
(05:57:49)<deveah>http://www.isitchristmas.com/
(06:06:26)<joe6pack>what's up purestrain?
(06:08:56)<purestrain>i need more time :P
(06:09:54)<joe6pack>for the 7drl?
(06:09:59)<purestrain>yes
(06:10:08)<joe6pack>then what are you doing here? go code!
(06:10:11)<joe6pack>:p
(06:18:44)<deveah>i have to give to get
(06:21:40)<purestrain>go code is nice to say... i'm doomed, i'm currently more often playing my game instead of coding
(06:28:41)<joe6pack>that's a good sign :)
(06:28:45)<joe6pack>it means it's fun
(06:29:27)<deveah>or buggy
(06:29:36)<deveah>cya
(06:33:54)<purestrain>3 minium todos today: 1. make zombies a little more intelligent, 2. proper line-of-sight, 3. proper field-of-view
(07:35:10)<purestrain>the walking dead is now quite challenging :-)
(08:50:17)<purestrain>so what fov system should i use?
(08:50:28)<purestrain>something which can get implemented in almost 2 hours please :-)
(08:58:00)<purestrain>i think one must reside anywhere on my hdd
(08:58:04)<purestrain>but i don't find it
(08:58:47)<purestrain>oh... there it was :-) an old abandoned c++ project
(09:36:36)<RotateMe>just normal raycasting
(09:37:03)<RotateMe>if you want you can ehance it by lighting up certain walltiles
(09:37:15)<RotateMe>:D just found a bug in the new firefox
(09:37:44)<purestrain>http://www.geocities.com/temerra/los_rays.html <- i've implemented this one, but it doesn't seem to work
(09:37:48)<purestrain>or i made a mistake
(09:39:51)<RotateMe>i tried this once but it's not easy imo
(09:40:19)<RotateMe>some passages are not written too well if i remember right
(09:41:46)<purestrain>it works quite... but i can see one tile behind walls
(09:44:28)<purestrain>and its not compatible with bresenham for shooting :-(
(09:46:07)<RotateMe>there's no reason to not use classic raycasting at the borders of your fov
(09:46:24)<RotateMe>you can minimize errors with real easy techniques
(09:50:43)<purestrain>right... making the 3rd fow implementation; i've nothing else to do
(10:01:42)<RotateMe>purestrain, found the bug?
(10:02:01)<purestrain>no... i'm doing now plain raycasting
(10:02:33)<ido>what's up?
(10:03:01)<joe6pack>hey cakeboy. haven't seen you in a while
(10:03:05)<joe6pack>i *think*
(10:04:37)<joe6pack>btw, anyone interesting in taking over cryptrover?
(10:04:52)<joe6pack>s/interesting/interested 
(10:05:22)<RotateMe>you don't want to finish it yourelf?
(10:05:27)<joe6pack>surprsingly enough, there are still people downloading it everyday
(10:05:47)<joe6pack>it was finished after the first 7 days, as far as i am concerned 
(10:06:03)<joe6pack>all the core features are implemented, no major bugs
(10:06:27)<joe6pack>no it's just adding fluff and candy 
(10:06:33)<joe6pack>s/no/now
(10:06:42)<purestrain>raycasting sucks
(10:06:50)<purestrain>i want my z buffer :P
(10:06:56)<joe6pack>:|
(10:07:32)<purestrain>everything worked fine for now, except field of view
(10:07:44)<joe6pack>i was toying with adding all kind of stuff like bolld splatter and that sort of things
(10:07:49)<joe6pack>maybe new kinds of enemies 
(10:07:58)<joe6pack>or a couple of new items 
(10:08:27)<joe6pack>but really, i can't think of anything major i'd change 
(10:09:09)<RotateMe>well if not you, who else?
(10:09:09)<purestrain>4th algorithm.... now i try breshenham until the max radius cells
(10:09:26)<joe6pack>that was the 1st one i tried
(10:09:27)<RotateMe>isn't that raycasting?
(10:10:26)<purestrain>i tried it with real casts instead of breshenham
(10:10:41)<joe6pack>RotateMe: i'm just saying, if anyone wants it, it's there for the taking 
(10:11:59)<RotateMe>joe, you should post that on your website, i think everyone here is busy with his own projects
(10:12:44)<joe6pack>i think i'll hold on to it for a while longer then...
(10:14:16)<purestrain>whats an easy way to eleminate artifacts? i would say: if a tile is visible, the surrounding walls are visible too
(10:14:57)<joe6pack>i never needed to eliminate anything. plain ol' check if every cell is in the los works perfectly for me 
(10:14:59)<RotateMe>if a tile is visible make all tiles in the opposite direction of the player visible
(10:15:32)<joe6pack>if a tile is visible make all the tiles on the map visible 
(10:15:51)<RotateMe>so if a lit tile is above and left of the player make the tile left of it, the tile above it and the tile left-above it visible
(10:16:19)<RotateMe>replace left-above with the correct english term and you're done :D
(10:21:49)<RotateMe>have a look at this if you still have problems
(10:21:52)<RotateMe>http://jice.nospam.googlepages.com/visibilitydetermination
(10:22:03)<RotateMe>i got to get some sleep i got my 5th exam tomorrow
(10:22:12)<joe6pack>good luck

(06:24:25)<purestrain>good evening
(07:49:13)<joe6pack>that Space Marine 7drl makes me want to do a curses version of warcraft 1 :)
(07:49:37)<joe6pack>anyone knows of a site listing all the war1 units & their attributes?
(07:59:14)<purestrain>warcraft1... that was the _real_ warcraft
(07:59:59)<purestrain>i remember playing it against a friend over serial cable
(08:01:29)<joe6pack>i have found it on an abandonware site
(08:01:55)<joe6pack> but i would rather not got through it and document how many hitpoints etc each unit has...
(08:02:22)<joe6pack>i remember playing it at a friend's house when iit was newe
(08:22:31)<purestrain>i think after the next weekend i will stay on realtime instead of turnbased
(08:24:24)<purestrain>and i'll use opengl instead of plain sdl
(08:25:36)<purestrain>since that i won't even be a roguelike anymore
(08:28:03)<joe6pack>i think accelerated graphicsc are pretty much universally available these days
(08:28:16)<joe6pack>i'd use opengl regardless 
(08:28:45)<purestrain>my former target system was a handheld without opengl; but i don't get d running on it :-(

(09:12:36)<purestrain>i would like to make a remake of z, quite another interesting rts
(09:21:29)<joe6pack>i remember some game named z
(09:21:41)<joe6pack>iirc you didn't have to build buildings?
(09:21:59)<joe6pack>i just remember it was a bit different than dune 2/c&c/warcraft
(09:26:40)<purestrain>yes
(09:27:35)<joe6pack>mi didn't play it much at all
(09:28:12)<joe6pack>the ones i played a ton of were war2/c&c-red alert and i think total annihilation 
(09:28:24)<joe6pack>was that the one with the mechs?
(09:28:40)<joe6pack>anyway some game from 96 or 97
(09:28:51)<joe6pack>i was an rts fiend at that time
(09:31:40)<purestrain>up until the rts got more and more without the actual strategy ?
(09:48:30)<joe6pack>hrm? starcraft and warcraft 3 both contain quite a bit of strategy 
(09:48:36)<purestrain>uah... today i've got lots of map errors
(09:48:42)<purestrain>something is going wrong today
(09:49:23)<joe6pack>but yea, somewhere around that time there were ~3 years were rts's were very poplar and a lot of generic crappy ones were produced 
(09:55:39)<purestrain>is it within the 7drl rules if someone tests the game before finish ?
(09:55:51)<joe6pack>sure why not
(09:56:40)<purestrain>i would like to get a first opinion, do you mind and have a windows system running ?
(09:56:54)<joe6pack>i can use virtualbox
(09:57:15)<joe6pack>link?
(09:57:24)<joe6pack>or you can also email me
(09:57:34)<joe6pack>ido.yehieli@gmail.com
(09:58:00)<purestrain>i hope its fast enough ;-)
(09:58:20)<joe6pack>we will see :)
(09:58:27)<joe6pack>are you emailing me it?
(09:59:13)<purestrain>i'd better use a link, it will be faster
(09:59:33)<joe6pack>does it matter? i assume it is onlt a few kb
(09:59:44)<purestrain>2,7mb
(09:59:51)<joe6pack>ok
(10:00:06)<joe6pack> you can /msg me the link if you want
(10:00:13)<joe6pack>or post it publicly 
(10:00:16)<joe6pack>your choice 
(10:01:00)<joe6pack>oh finally, all the unit statistics for war1
(11:09:53)<joe6pack>anyone played this game: www.globulation2.org

(10:38:25)<oeb>They closed down a Space Hulk computer game last week
(10:38:42)<oeb>A few months ago they closed down a fan film that has been in development for years
(10:55:27)<cakeboy>way to alienate your fan base
(10:56:43)<TMC>a fan film?
(10:56:49)<TMC>any details about it?
(11:00:05)<oeb>Damantus or something it was called
(11:00:32)<oeb>If you search fan film or german in rec.games.minitures.warhammer something will probably show up
(11:01:12)<oeb>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnatus
(11:12:47)<oeb>cakeboy, yup. The fan film really was overkill though. The producers asked GW Germany, and they said 'Ya, sure no problem'. When the film was ready for release GW HQ said 'Hold on, germany can't approve that! KILL KILL KILL'
(11:19:37)<joe6pack>hi everyone 
(11:21:42)<TMC>hi
(11:21:43)<TMC>hmm
(11:21:54)<TMC>someone left the CIA bot running in #rln :P
(11:22:02)<joe6pack>i think i need to learn sdl
(11:22:11)<joe6pack>the time has come
(11:22:19)<joe6pack>for graphic game
(11:22:22)<joe6pack>s
(11:22:50)<TMC>it's easy but complex
(11:23:03)<TMC>portable but slightly inflexible
(11:23:07)<joe6pack>i think i will try to clone warcraft 1. it's as simple an rts i can think of that is still fun to play
(11:23:16)<joe6pack>what's complex about it?
(11:23:33)<TMC>well, I'm thinking of the video functions
(11:24:15)<TMC>which can be hard to match up correctly
(11:24:37)<TMC>SDL will let you blit anything to anything, but a mismatch can kill your fps
(11:24:47)<joe6pack>do you know of a better gfx lib?
(11:24:48)<TMC>also, the custom scancodes were a pain for me
(11:25:04)<TMC>no, haven't looked either
(11:25:10)<joe6pack>Keyboard scancodes?
(11:25:17)<TMC>you should be good enough for you
(11:25:18)<TMC>actually!
(11:25:23)<TMC>I can name a better one
(11:25:26)<TMC>pygame :P
(11:25:38)<joe6pack>pygame is an sdl wrapper...
(11:26:24)<TMC>I know
(11:26:27)<TMC>it's better
(11:26:45)<joe6pack>i rather program in c actually. that way i don't have to worry about performance. i can code most/all things in a naive way and it's usually fast enough
(11:26:50)<TMC>the goodness of python, plus extenstions
(11:26:59)<joe6pack>i remember trying an rl in python
(11:27:06)<joe6pack>maybe 4 years ago or so
(11:27:08)<joe6pack>maybe more
(11:27:21)<joe6pack>it started getting slow with pathfinding or fov 
(11:27:24)<TMC>naive approaches don't always work out when when dealing with graphics
(11:27:25)<joe6pack>or something like that
(11:27:41)<TMC>C doesn't help
(11:27:44)<joe6pack>well the graphic part will be quite small
(11:27:57)<joe6pack>i mean naive approches to stuff like pathfinding/ai/map generation/etc
(11:28:13)<joe6pack>worked for me till now,
(11:28:15)<joe6pack>of course
(11:28:24)<joe6pack>i have only been doing turn based games....
(11:28:31)<joe6pack>but anyway i like c
(11:28:35)<joe6pack>that's the main reason
(11:29:10)<joe6pack>what was particularly slow with sdl?
(11:29:11)<TMC>yeah
(11:29:54)<TMC>well I had to struggle to get a fullscreen app to run at above 20fps on a friends computer
(11:30:05)<TMC>all it did was paint approx 200 tiles to screen
(11:30:13)<joe6pack>huh
(11:30:16)<TMC>I finally got it to 60Hz
(11:30:26)<joe6pack>60fps is goodf 
(11:30:31)<TMC>but only at 16bpp and who knows what else
(11:30:39)<TMC>yeah
(11:30:58)<TMC>but most video options I tried ran at 15 or 5 fps :P
(11:31:15)<TMC>anyway
(11:31:32)<TMC>its definitely suitable
(11:31:46)<joe6pack>i don't care about that. for a war 1 clone i will be satisfied with 8 bit gfx, ~200 tiles which will not be updated every frame (only on screen scroll) and maybe 10-15 fps
(11:31:48)<TMC>I hate graphics programming
(11:31:58)<TMC>I always think I'm not doing it right
(11:32:04)<joe6pack>what was the resolution you tried?
(11:32:19)<TMC>640x480 I think
(11:32:32)<joe6pack>really? and it had problems displaying that?
(11:32:32)<TMC>or 800x600 probably
(11:32:38)<joe6pack>wierd 
(11:32:45)<TMC>well
(11:32:49)<joe6pack>did you use hardware acceleration? 
(11:32:54)<TMC>people make fast paced games with SDL
(11:33:07)<joe6pack>that's why i'm surprised 
(11:33:10)<TMC>and video players and all sorts of stuff
(11:33:21)<TMC>no, this was on a friends computer
(11:33:28)<TMC>I think it was an old one
(11:33:34)<TMC>I mean, it was
(11:33:47)<TMC>but I'd rather make games that play on old computers
(11:33:50)<joe6pack>it sounds like painting 200 tiles @ 800x600 should work fine even on a pentium II
(11:33:57)<TMC>I had no video card on this 8 year old computer
(11:34:04)<TMC>and my other one has a TNT2
(11:34:09)<joe6pack>huh
(11:34:10)<TMC>*have no
(11:34:19)<joe6pack>what kind of computer was that again?
(11:34:23)<joe6pack>more or less
(11:34:23)<TMC>was what
(11:34:28)<TMC>can't remember
(11:34:30)<TMC>wasn't mine
(11:34:32)<joe6pack>the one that ran too slow
(11:34:36)<TMC>about the same as this one
(11:34:50)<joe6pack>pentium? pentium2?
(11:34:52)<TMC>I don't think I managed to get 60Hz on this one
(11:36:26)<TMC>python can't be that slow if they're using it for the XO :P
(11:36:50)<joe6pack>just to get the order of magnitude, you said that 800x600/200 tiles/16bpp/60hz/software rendering on an ~8 years old computer worked?
(11:37:01)<joe6pack>the xo is very slow
(11:37:14)<joe6pack>i couldn't handle using it for more than a couple of minutes
(11:37:27)<joe6pack>everything takes forever. even the basic gui

(09:27:43)<joe6pack>so you are the stepfather, then?
(09:28:21)<purestrain>yep
(09:31:38)<joe6pack>nothing like looking for info on old games to make you realise there was once a time when the web was not obiquous

(03:22:06)<Glowie>For a roguelike?
(03:22:20)<ido>actually for my warcraft 1 clone :)
(03:22:40)<ido>but i think the setting is similar enough to be able to use the same tiles
(03:22:47)<Glowie>Oh :)
(03:23:00)<ido>do you know of any others?
(03:23:06)<ido>other than the ones i've listed?
(03:23:19)<Glowie>At least not any decent ones (in my opinion) :P
(03:23:30)<Glowie>I'm not into tiled roguelikes so I'm not up to date with tiles
(03:24:25)<ido>yea, me neither. the problem is, when i show anything i've made to people who don't play roguelikes adding graphics is often the 1st thing they ask about
(03:25:14)<ido>the good thing is that they've often also not seen the common rl tiles yet
(03:25:36)<ido>so i can use those and most people wouldn't know they're extremely overused :)
(03:26:37)<Glowie>Hehe
(03:26:40)<ido>graphics make a huge difference for a lot of casual (and none casual) players. sad but true 
(03:26:57)<ido>i like the 2d ones from crawl
(03:27:05)<Glowie>They do, but I just think it's their loss if they can't see the Beauty of the ASCII :P
(03:27:55)<ido>yes, but i am toying with the idea of try to get into the indie game making business eventually. 
(03:28:50)<ido>i know it isn't a very profitable market, but if i can scrape by for some time doing game development i'll be content 
(03:29:22)<Glowie>That's not an easy path I can assure you. An internet friend of mine released a new game (indie, small team, but well polished game with a price not too high) just a week ago and it was cracked+keygen'ed in LESS THAN A DAY :(
(03:29:37)<ido>heh
(03:29:45)<Glowie>I bet they weren't 'heh'
(03:30:01)<ido>well the people who pirate games aren't the same people who buy them
(03:30:15)<Glowie>True too
(03:31:04)<ido>i read something about that by the makers of "sins of a solar empire"
(03:31:10)<ido>let me try and find it 
(03:31:40)<jraregris>Chris Delay had an interesting piece on how to add value to actually buying the product over pirating it (example: WoW: you can pirate it and play single player, but not play on the servers))

(03:32:35)<ido>Glowie: link to the game?

(03:33:41)<Glowie>They're planning to lower the price and they might get to Steam too..
(03:34:31)<ido>oh wow
(03:34:34)<ido>looks very cool
(03:34:53)<ido>looks professional 
(03:35:26)<ido>is it any good?
(03:35:40)<Glowie>I've beta tested it and yes, it's addicting :P
(03:35:52)<ido>looks complicated
(03:36:05)<Glowie>The replay value of the game depends on the player really, not everyone like tower defense style games
(03:36:25)<Glowie>Not that complicated when you know how it works
(03:36:54)<ido>will you buy it?
(03:37:19)<Glowie>Not at least yet
(03:37:24)<ido>why not?
(03:37:58)<Glowie>I have enough things to do and games to play already (and I beta tested it so part of the replay value has already gone)
(03:38:11)<Glowie>Plus, if I'm going to buy it, it's going to be after the probable price reduction :P
(03:39:06)<RotateMe>psp?
(03:39:06)<ido>some friend you are ;)
(03:39:19)<RotateMe>(hi btw)
(03:39:31)<Glowie>An internet friend :b
(03:39:38)<Glowie>Hello at RotateMe
(03:39:54)<RotateMe>Glowie, you want to buy a psp or what?
(03:39:59)<Glowie>Nope
(03:40:21)<ido>RotateMe: http://www.oxeyegames.com/harvest/
(03:40:23)<Glowie>We were talking about indie games, and a game made by my friend when you came in
(03:40:29)<ido>that's what we were talking about
(03:40:53)<RotateMe>oh, i misread "probable price reduction :P"
(03:41:10)<RotateMe>just had a math exam and are still a bit weird :D
(03:41:31)<ido>it looks like a serious company 
(03:41:36)<ido>not a one man show
(03:41:55)<Glowie>Quite small but indeed very professional looking indie group
(03:42:07)<ido>how many people are they?
(03:43:14)<Glowie>Uhm.. Actually I'm not sure about the exact number, about 4-7 I think
(03:43:15)<RotateMe>looks cool, gonna try the demo
(03:43:22)<RotateMe>did you try it?
(03:43:24)<ido>hmm
(03:43:30)<Glowie>I've beta tested it
(03:43:42)<joe6pack>they are looking for a programmer 
(03:43:47)<joe6pack>http://www.oxeyegames.com/jobs/
(03:43:53)<Glowie>In Sweden
(03:44:08)<joe6pack>minor issue 
(03:44:33)<joe6pack>if i would have found a company i wanted to work for i would have gladely relocated 
(03:44:45)<joe6pack>i mean it depends to where, of course
(03:45:05)<RotateMe>http://www.fierz.ch/strategy.htm -> worth the link of the day?
(03:45:05)<joe6pack>but i would have no problem relocating to anywhere in the eu or north america
(03:45:30)<joe6pack>RotateMe: if you think it is, then it is :)
(03:46:18)<joe6pack>as far as i am concerned, if the current lotd is ~1 day old or more, you could replace it with whatever non-spam link you wish
(03:46:53)<joe6pack>if it is bad, someone else would just change it to something better
(03:47:03)<joe6pack>that's why everyone can change the subject on the channel 
(03:48:19)<joe6pack>interesting that they require a "# Portfolio of past game project that you have developed" from an intern 
(03:48:42)<RotateMe>why from an intern?
(03:48:49)<RotateMe>isn't it an open job description?
(03:48:49)<joe6pack>how many interns would actually have a portfolio to show? 
(03:49:01)<joe6pack>it says "Programmer Intern"
(03:49:29)<RotateMe>well maybe they suggest you did some more stuff in your freetime
(03:49:35)<Glowie>They are still new at being a company. I guess they really mean if the applicant has made games as a hobby and can show those
(03:49:40)<Glowie>Exactly
(03:49:43)<joe6pack>the whole point of being an "intern" and not just a "programmer"is that you have no experience 
(03:50:12)<joe6pack>what does that friend of your think of roguelikes? ;)
(03:50:36)<RotateMe>o||o? he couldn't concentrate long enough to play one
(03:50:53)<RotateMe>well he slashed his way through diablo 1 a few times now that i think about it
(03:51:16)<joe6pack>RotateMe: i was asking Glowie, i have no idea which friend you are talking about :)
(03:51:31)<RotateMe>sry
(03:51:36)<joe6pack>no problem
(03:51:41)<RotateMe>mp3 of the weak composer
(03:51:56)<Glowie>He knows the genre, has tried FD, but isn't a fan of the genre :P
(03:51:57)<RotateMe>i just posted it and you asked that's why i thought you meant him
(03:52:05)<joe6pack>ok
(03:52:24)<joe6pack>i didn't even see that you've changed that as well
(03:52:30)<RotateMe>k
(03:52:40)<joe6pack>will give it a go
(03:53:05)<RotateMe>man this job description sounds cool
(03:54:02)<joe6pack>is dungeonhunter your game?
(03:54:59)<RotateMe>yep
(03:55:14)<joe6pack>where did you take the tiles from?
(03:55:18)<RotateMe>it's not featuring that music or any music :D
(03:55:29)<RotateMe>rm2k chipsets
(03:55:46)<RotateMe>but most of them has been changed enough to be legal for a beta ^^
(03:56:02)<RotateMe>damn the graphics of dawn of daria look awesome
(03:56:08)<joe6pack>rm2k?
(03:57:27)<RotateMe>rpg maker 2000
(03:57:58)<RotateMe>well most of the tiles are from custom tilesets anyway and they again ripped it mostly from snes games
(03:59:03)<RotateMe>i'm currently working on ascii support
(03:59:15)<joe6pack>oh ok
(03:59:37)<RotateMe>it's nearly finished but i didn't work on my game the last few days (weaks?) hence the exams
(03:59:46)<joe6pack>RotateMe: i was searching for sources of free tiles
(03:59:52)<joe6pack>getquote tiles
(03:59:52)<null>tiles(0):  http://www.reinerstileset.4players.de:1059/englisch.htm
(03:59:52)<null>tiles(1):  http://pousse.rapiere.free.fr/tome/

(03:59:52)<null>tiles(3):  http://wiki.allegro.cc/Graphics_Depot
(03:59:53)<RotateMe>and of all my 9 hated subject i think i just fucked up maths, the only subject i liked
(04:00:06)<joe6pack>i ahve an exam on teusday 
(04:00:25)<joe6pack>and then hopfully some peace of mind due to Easter 
(04:00:42)<joe6pack>but this subject is a nice one
(04:00:51)<joe6pack>so i don't mind learning for that much
(04:00:56)<RotateMe>yep I'll have 3 exams to go (6 are over) which will be in monday, tuesday and wednesday
(04:01:18)<RotateMe>then i will get drunk enough to sleep 2 more days and then i have freetime for about 2 weaks
(04:01:25)<joe6pack>:)
(04:01:26)<RotateMe>in which i will do my 7drl
(04:01:41)<joe6pack>you sure know how to party ;)
(04:02:32)<RotateMe>... which lead to a photo of me throwing up at a party finding its way to my boss
(04:02:50)<joe6pack>so do you have any tiles link other than the 4 that are already there?
(04:02:59)<RotateMe>i'm just looking
(04:03:04)<joe6pack>i am sure he doesn't give a shit
(04:03:14)<joe6pack>if he is anything like any boss i've had 
(04:03:28)<RotateMe>well he can't do anything so i don't give a shit ;)
(04:03:44)<RotateMe>besides as i said i'm quitting and study maths in about juli
(04:03:51)<joe6pack>oh ok
(04:03:54)<joe6pack>good luck
(04:04:21)<joe6pack>but doesn't uni only begin at october?
(04:05:26)<RotateMe>problem is in order to apply for university i must not study at another university
(04:05:40)<RotateMe>applying starts in juli so i have to quit then
(04:06:07)<joe6pack>that's weird 
(04:06:08)<RotateMe>sadly i can't just quit uni and continue to work until my maths study starts
(04:06:20)<RotateMe>why?
(04:06:20)<joe6pack>in austria you can study in more than 1 uni at any given time
(04:06:36)<RotateMe>nope it's not possible here
(04:06:39)<joe6pack>i know a few people who study in both tuwien and uni wien
(04:06:45)<RotateMe>maybe it depends on the uni
(04:07:15)<joe6pack>so are you also moving to berlin in july? 
(04:07:23)<RotateMe>yep about then
(04:07:27)<joe6pack>cool
(04:07:51)<RotateMe>i can live at a friend's and from there i can find a living community (if that's what it's called)
(04:07:56)<RotateMe>wohngemeinschaft ;)
(04:08:10)<joe6pack>apartment? ;)
(04:08:23)<RotateMe>yeah an apartment where other students live
(04:08:40)<RotateMe>so you share a flat and share the costs
(04:08:50)<joe6pack>yes i know
(04:08:54)<joe6pack>i live in one atm
(04:08:59)<joe6pack>have been since i was 19
(04:09:11)<RotateMe>i guess it's much better then living alone
(04:09:22)<RotateMe>well you can have bad luck but i doubt that happens
(04:09:37)<RotateMe>seems most of the rm2k chipsets are rips from commercial games :(
(04:09:46)<joe6pack>i would have preferred living alone i think, but i can't afford it 
(04:10:02)<joe6pack>i know live with 1 other guy
(04:10:20)<joe6pack>but he works ~60 hours a week so it's not really a problem
(04:10:22)<deveah>hello
(04:10:28)<joe6pack>i barely notice he's here
(04:10:31)<joe6pack>hi deveah 
(04:10:40)<deveah>are the 1drls ready?

(04:11:47)<RotateMe>lazy people :P
(04:11:56)<joe6pack>or at least didn't get a lot of publicity yet :)
(04:11:59)<RotateMe>wow 60 hours a weak what does he do?
(04:12:16)<joe6pack>programmer in a very small start up company 
(04:12:27)<joe6pack>it's just him and i think 2 or 3 other guys
(04:12:42)<joe6pack>he often works on the weekend as well
(04:13:55)<RotateMe>does it go well?
(04:14:02)<joe6pack>i think so
(04:14:15)<RotateMe>so join them already :D
(04:14:17)<joe6pack>they have customers that are waiting for them to finish off development 
(04:14:26)<joe6pack>no thanks... 
(04:14:42)<joe6pack>i have neither the will nor the time to work that many hours 
(04:16:01)<RotateMe>yeah i'm already doing it and i'm quitting so i can understand why not doing so
(04:16:21)<joe6pack>and i want to finally finish off my studies as well
(04:16:24)<RotateMe>time in university is the peaceful time with 45 hours/weak and 9 exams
(04:16:36)<joe6pack>exactly :)
(04:16:43)<RotateMe>going to try this harvest game now
(05:03:30)<RotateMe>heh
(05:03:40)<RotateMe>got to wave 32 which is pretty bad i think#
(05:03:42)<RotateMe>was fun though
(05:05:18)<joe6pack>maybe i could contact some pixel artist who's work i liked and ask them how much they'd charge for some tiles & sprites
(05:11:08)<RotateMe>do you have something in mind?
(05:13:18)<joe6pack>you mean for the art? or what i want to use it for?
(05:13:53)<joe6pack>i was thinking pretty standard 32x32 tiles,
(05:14:24)<joe6pack>characters/grass/water/items/etc..
(05:17:45)<joe6pack>maybe i could get david e gervais ;)
(05:33:50)<deveah>beware of my dos gui :p
(05:38:02)<deveah>omg it's a lot of work...
(05:45:09)<deveah>simply addbutton, drawform, button properties, getbutton, getclicked
(06:47:17)<RotateMe>joe6pack, i meant what you want the tiles for?
(06:48:20)<joe6pack>RotateMe: a warcraft 1-like rts game
(06:56:34)<RotateMe>last time you wanted to do it in ascii
(06:57:24)<joe6pack>people don't give ascii the love it deserves :(
(06:57:42)<purestrain>you want to game a rts ?
(06:57:43)<RotateMe>yeah... but you think a wc1 like game would sell?
(06:57:59)<joe6pack>no, but it would get more people playng it
(06:58:16)<joe6pack>i will start off with fake ascii
(06:58:25)<joe6pack>i.e. sdl with ascii tiles
(06:58:50)<RotateMe>ah okay thought you'd want to sell it because you said maybe you'd pay for the pixel art
(06:59:12)<joe6pack>maybe i will...
(06:59:16)<joe6pack>pay that is
(06:59:18)<joe6pack>for good art
(06:59:30)<joe6pack>but that doesn't mean it will be sellable 
(06:59:43)<purestrain>donate game
(06:59:55)<joe6pack>the question is expensive the art would be 
(06:59:55)<purestrain>could be possible... i already donated to several games which i played frquently
(07:00:44)<joe6pack>purestrain: yea, if it turns out alright i might go that way, but i don't think it will actually bring in any significat revenue 
(07:00:52)<joe6pack>i do it for the experience 
(07:01:00)<joe6pack>and for fun
(07:01:03)<purestrain>right
(07:02:00)<purestrain>i'll start of with a new game too; but i don't want to make it in seven days ;-)

(07:02:32)<purestrain>id either thought about something like alien breed or something like Z
(07:02:43)<RotateMe>you can look through these and kindly ask the people who did this if you can use their graphics
(07:02:59)<RotateMe>the answer might be yes if you have something to show them
(07:03:21)<joe6pack>ok
(07:03:22)<joe6pack>thanks
(07:04:36)<joe6pack>http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/18998.htm
(07:04:41)<joe6pack>that's a good one :)
(07:04:51)<RotateMe>heh i liked that too
(07:04:53)<joe6pack>"brutus"...
(07:05:15)<RotateMe>brute is right in this case
(07:06:28)<RotateMe>oh sry it doesn't say that :D
(07:08:08)<RotateMe>http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/11203.htm
(07:08:14)<joe6pack>something like this one would be right:
(07:08:14)<joe6pack>http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/11203.htm
(07:08:16)<RotateMe>i think they might fit well
(07:08:21)<RotateMe>LOL!
(07:08:24)<joe6pack>:)
(07:08:34)<joe6pack>great minds think alike...
(07:08:50)<RotateMe>yep... ask that guy after you got some ascii stuff done
(07:09:00)<joe6pack>yea
(07:09:02)<RotateMe>i guess he'd even provide more stuff
(07:09:08)<joe6pack>that's a good idea
(07:09:42)<joe6pack>has practically all of the terrain, only needs more units 
(07:09:58)<joe6pack>and i guess a bit of movement animation
(07:10:17)<joe6pack>(and buildings)
(07:13:51)<joe6pack>http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/21609.htm
(07:15:35)<RotateMe>if this weren't cows and the enemies weren't chicken this could make a good game :D
(07:17:25)<RotateMe>http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/24855.htm
(07:18:29)<RotateMe>this looks pretty useful: http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/14199.htm
(07:19:57)<RotateMe>there you go: http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/12221.htm
(07:21:00)<joe6pack>i liked the farm animals motif :)

(07:50:13)<purestrain>uah... if someone of these people at pixeljoin could help me for the roguelike :-)
(07:50:41)<joe6pack>the one i liked the most had no contact info :(
(07:53:12)<RotateMe_away>doesn't it have a pm system?
(07:53:51)<RotateMe_away>or comment on one of his pics
(07:53:54)<RotateMe_away>you might be lucky
(07:55:28)<joe6pack>when the time comes...
(07:55:41)<joe6pack>but his last post is from 2006, so i am not optimistic
(08:21:26)<joe6pack>hi there Aerton 
(08:23:29)<Aerton>hi there
(08:23:32)<Glowie>Evening Aerton
(08:23:55)<Glowie>Or perhaps early morning for you >_<
(08:24:10)<Glowie>Have you been crunching at work lately?
(08:24:13)<Aerton>midway from evening to morning ^^
(08:24:18)<Glowie>Hehe
(08:24:33)<Aerton>not today
(08:24:50)<Glowie>But the past week?
(08:25:06)<Aerton>yeah, I missed 7drl because of that :/
(08:25:44)<Glowie>I thought so :<
(08:26:20)<deveah>who needs commandprompt guis?
(08:26:33)<Glowie>What is a commandprompt gui?
(08:26:46)<Glowie>Command prompt + graphical user interface don't meet in my head
(08:28:45)<deveah>i *can* do that, but with basic-speed it would probably suck
(08:29:00)<deveah>textbox,label,button
(08:29:29)<Glowie>That's just weird :P
(08:29:48)<deveah>well visual basic for dos has those and looks kewl
(08:35:02)<joe6pack>there is also some curses based library (cdt?)  that does something like that
(08:35:43)<Aerton>there was borland turbo vision
(08:36:09)<Aerton>it's not command-prompt at all
(08:36:22)<Aerton>just a gui
(08:36:56)<joe6pack>yea, just implemented with ascii 
(09:33:23)<jomiolto>hello beautiful people :)
(09:44:12)<purestrain>hello
(09:45:52)<jomiolto>finally got around to making a roguebasin page for Alan's Psychedelic Journey
(09:51:27)<jomiolto>hmm, there's going to be a lot of fresh roguelikes to try out if the 7drl contest has a good success rate
(09:51:56)<purestrain>try my aborted one and tell me if it runs at least ;-) if you have windows, of course
(09:52:36)<jomiolto>hmm, well, I do have Vista, but I'm too lazy to boot to it right now, but I'll try it again later (if i remember, that is)
(09:52:58)<jomiolto>which one is it?
(09:53:20)<purestrain>http://retroforge.de/%7Emd/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/residentevil.png <- this one, the zombie roguelike
(09:54:47)<jomiolto>okay, I downloaded it and I'll try it when I boot to windows
(09:55:36)<purestrain>its very well balanced... i actually finished the game with only one enemy encounter
(09:55:43)<purestrain>zombies take far to long for reanimation
(09:56:07)<purestrain>and i forgot to make the clip size smaller... 150 shots / clip was for debugging only :-)
(09:56:47)<jomiolto>it looks quite interesting :)

(10:54:32)<joe6pack>heh
(10:55:07)<RotateMe>hmm doesn't the channel remember that i was op not only voiced yesterday?

(10:57:28)<RotateMe>wow
(10:57:28)<joe6pack>and now 5 :)
(10:57:31)<RotateMe>they are hawt
(10:57:55)<RotateMe>thought you had added the tiles you might use for your wc1-like
(10:58:27)<joe6pack>these weren't really tiles though, just some sketches 
(10:58:47)<joe6pack>i mean they were not in a format you could just drop in a game
(11:00:02)<RotateMe>not?
(11:00:21)<joe6pack>not the ones from that pixel art website at least 
(11:00:28)<RotateMe>the second file with the pink-ish background
(11:00:38)<RotateMe>i would use them like this to add them to a game
(11:00:41)<joe6pack>yea, but these were very few tiles
(11:00:50)<joe6pack>only a couple of units
(11:00:54)<deveah>i think numbers si a great 7drl
(11:01:20)<joe6pack>anyway you can it if you'd like
(11:01:28)<joe6pack>"can add it"
(11:10:27)<RotateMe>shouldn't most of the 7drls be finished today or when did they all start?
(11:10:34)<joe6pack>yes
(02:27:44)<deveah_>somethingwithzombies rocks!
(02:37:13)<cakeboy>yeah
(02:37:20)<cakeboy>the only thing i didn't like about it was the controls :(
(03:03:24)<deveah_>what do you see wrong here: http://rafb.net/p/wbTKqP97.html
(03:03:25)<deveah_>?
(03:20:22)<RotateMe>i's VB?
(03:20:26)<RotateMe>*it's
(03:22:30)<RotateMe>hmm nothing else from quickly scanning through it
(03:31:34)<deveah_>it's freebasic
(03:34:10)<RotateMe>did you find the error?
(03:37:25)<deveah_>it seems to be an endless loop
